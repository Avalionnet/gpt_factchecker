Andy Barr \""would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops\"" and that he took \""$36,550 from payday lenders.\"" .\nThe \""cross-partisan\"" group With Honor , which\\xc2\\xa0formed to support military veterans running for Congress, has backed Democratic challenger and Marine veteran Amy McGrath.\nThe ad says that Barr has accepted campaign donations from payday lending organizations and that he would let them take advantage of service members and their families.\n\""In Kentucky, we respect our troops, but Congressman Andy Barr would let shady payday lenders take advantage of them,\"" the ad says. It goes on to say that he took \""$36,550 from payday lenders, then let them stick our troops with outrageous fees. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong with Congress.\"".\nIt is no secret that payday lenders routinely sock consumers with excessively high charges and fees. But did Barr \""let them\"" stick military families with outrageous fees, while also taking money from them for his campaign?.\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \""payday loans are small-dollar, short-term, unsecured loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck or regular income payment.\"" Payday loans often include very high interest rates or fees.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama through the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010,\\xc2\\xa0launched the nation\\'s first program for supervising \""non-bank\"" financial services, which include payday loan providers, as well as debt collectors, mortgage companies and credit-score companies.\nAt issue is Barr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2017 vote for the Financial CHOICE Act , which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Barr was one of seven original cosponsors of the bill.\nThe bill would make sweeping changes and repeal provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, in part by weakening the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nUnder the plan, the agency would lose its oversight of payday lenders. There is a line in the legislation that says, \""the agency may not exercise any rulemaking, enforcement, or other authority with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\nWith Honor spokeswoman Ellen Zeng also pointed to a June 2017 Military.com article that grappled with whether the bill would undo certain protections for active and retired service members and their families.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe bureau has played a major role in \""providing restitution and help to troops taken advantage of by illegal financial practices,\"" the article states.\nOne program, in the bureau\\'s\\xc2\\xa0Office of Servicemember Affairs department, has fielded over 74,000 complaints about predatory financial practices from the military community since 2011, a 2017 CFPB report says , resulting in more than $130 million in relief to affected service members.\nBarr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign released a statement after the ad aired calling it misleading. There are\\xc2\\xa0existing laws that protect military families from payday lenders, the campaign said.\nThe 2006 Military Lending Act \\xc2\\xa0put a 36 percent cap on the amount of interest small-dollar lenders could charge on loans to military families.\nWhen veterans groups raised concerns about the Financial CHOICE Act, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who sponsored the bill and chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said it would not touch protections for veterans.\n\""The Financial Choice Act does not weaken the laws that specifically protect active-duty and retired members of our armed forces,\"" he said in a June 2017 statement.\nZeng says the group stands by the ad, as the bill would have drained the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she says plays a vital role in protecting military veterans and their families from predatory payday lenders.\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics , an authoritative database of campaign finance data, Barr has accepted $36,550 from PACs and individuals associated with the payday lending industry since his 2014 campaign. He has received $7,500 from payday lenders in 2018.\nWith Honor says Barr \""would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops\"" and that he received $36,550 in campaign donations from payday lenders.\nBarr voted for legislation that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power over payday lending agencies, which could indirectly affect military families as the agency fields complaints from the community.\nSo while the CFPB could have provided more protections to the military community than the 2006 law, the ad makes it appear as if Barr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions were connected to legislation specifically about veterans.\nSays Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr \""would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops\"" and that he took \""$36,550 from payday lenders.\"".\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause the Covid shots are still manufactured under the Emergency Use Authorization, they can change up to 49% of the ingredients without FDA approval.\"" .\n The sinking of the Titanic was orchestrated by the Rothschilds and J.P.

She asks you about the precedential value of a letter ruling. Indicate whether the following statements are \""Correct\"" or \""Incorrect\"" with regard to the precedential value of a letter ruling. a. A letter ruling is applicable only to the taxpayer it addresses. A letter ruling has no precedential authority over another taxpayer's situation. b. Letter rulings apply to all taxpayers with tax situations similar to the one the ruling addresses. Therefore, a letter ruling has precedential authority. c. Although a letter ruling is applicable only to the taxpayer it addresses, a ruling may be used as precedent for other taxpayers within the window of five years from the date the ruling was issued. a. Correct b. Incorrect c. Incorrect A letter ruling has no precedential value under \\xc2\\xa7 6110(k)(3). A letter ruling indicates the position of the IRS on the specific fact pattern present as of the date of the letter ruling. As such, a letter ruling is not primary authority.

The term does not include any return, schedule, or any other document prepared by the practitioner if the practitioner is withholding the document pending the client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance of a contractual obligation to pay fees with respect to the document. .\nIn addition, the CPA should consider the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct , specifically ET Section 501.02, Acts Discreditable , Interpretation 501-1, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cResponse to Requests by Clients and Former Clients for Records.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Under this section, when a client or former client requests that the client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s records either be sent to the client or forwarded to another CPA, a member\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to comply with the request would constitute a violation of this interpretation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClient-provided records,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as defined in this interpretation, are \\xe2\\x80\\x9caccounting or other records belonging to the client that were provided to the member, by or on behalf of, the client, including hardcopy or electronic reproductions of such records.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As can be seen, the definition of records for purposes of Interpretation 501-1 is much broader than the definition used in Circular 230. .\nIn addition, AICPA members are encouraged to comply with the rules and regulations of authoritative regulatory bodies, such as the member\\xe2\\x80\\x99s state board of accountancy, when the member performs services for a client and is subject to the rules and regulations of such regulatory body. .\nFor a detailed discussion of the issues in this area, see \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCurrent Tax Return Disclosure Issues Involving Sec. 7216,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by Thomas J.

die hard bernie sanders supporters truly unite behind hillary clinton? >> she will be the next president of the united states. >> will the dnc chair resigning under controversy be enough to help heal the divide? can the democrats all come together to help elect the first woman president? >> we are on the brink of a historic moment. >> starting tonight, we\\'re about to find out. >> we can do this. >> hillary! hillary! >> as the democrats pull out all the stops to make their case, why hillary clinton should be the next president of the united states. we\\'re just minutes away from a .\n block blockbuster moment of first night speakers, including the first lady. from abc news, this is the democratic national convention, live from philadelphia. now reporting, george stephanopoulos. >> good evening, and welcome to the democratic convention here in philadelphia. day one has already been a wild one. hillary clinton looking to make history this week, but it was clear today that she first has to make peace with her own party. all day long, bernie sanders supporters lashed out, on the flo floor, behind closed doors. they are angry over the leaked e-mails that show the party establishment working against their candidate. now, the chair of the dnc has resigned. you see her right there, she was booed today, as well. party officials have apologized. but so far, sanders supporters are still in a fighting mood. everyone braced for more trouble on the floor tonight. and as we wait to hear from michelle obama, i want to bring in donna brazile right now. .\n you see bernie sanders, he is going to speak tonight. you have stepped away from your role as our contributor. you are going to be the chair of the democratic national committee. i know you have been in talks all day long with the clinton team, with bernie sanders, with party officials. are you going to be able to get the protesters under control? >> they are passionate. they are delegates. they are protesting the fact that they don\\'t believe that the party platform, which is the most progressive ever in the democratic party, does not go far enough with the tpp, the trade agreement, but at the end of the day, george, the values that hold democrats together, the vision that democrats are inspired behind, i think that will bring the party together over the next couple days. >> they are still mad over the e-mails, as well, which showed a lot of insults to the bernie sanders people. i know you have apologized. but we heard a lot of rumblings as well. are you now convinced that vugs are, by leaking these e-mails, was trying to influence the .\n election? >> well, that\\'s the information we\\'ve received. the fbi is going to do an inquiry. given who we have hired to help us, we\\'ll get to the bottom of it. i want to let you know, earlier today, the party, not just myself, but the party that i will lead in a couple of days, we issued an apology. >> i want to go down to cecilia vega on the floor. you have been there all day lodge. you saw a lot of that action. >> george, we heard chanting, yelling, demonstrators and delegates shouting each other down. at the name hillary clinton, as if they were talking about the name donald trump. this is a hillary clinton on the vengs, but i will tell you, these bernie sanders supporters are out here tonight on this convention floor in defiance. i\\'m told by sources that the clinton campaigns and the sanders campaign have been working feverishly leading up to tonight to try to bring some calm to this convention floor. bernie sanders himself has sent e-mails and text messages to try to calm them down. tonight, the theme of this .\n evening is unity, but this is a convention floor that is in a house divided. right now. >> let\\'s keep our eye on the floor right now. you see president bill clinton there. he wasn\\'t supposed to be here tonight. matthew dowd, you are arguing that maybe some of the discord is good for the party? >> yeah, i think it is. what\\'s interesting to me, last week, there was much criticism of the republicans, and then what you have this week, we\\'ve got from amateur dysfunction to professional dysfunction in the course of what\\'s happened here. i recall, bernie sanders talked about a revolution. right up the road, 240 years ago, a group of folks got together and put pen to paper and started a revolution, and it\\'s very hard to devolve from it. >> we are about to see the first speaker of the night, first lady michelle obama, coming to the stage right now. >> ladies and gentlemen, please welcome first lady michelle obama. .\n >> martha raddatz, she could be the most politician in america right now, of course, not an elected official. >> she certainly is. and the person she wants to talk about tonight is hillary clinton. rub off some of that popularity. >> first of a blockbuster lineup. >> hello! thank you, all. thank you so much. you know, it\\'s hard to believe .\n that it has been eight years since i first came to this convention to talk with you about why i thought my husband should be president. remember how i told you about his character and conviction? his decency and his grace? the traits that we\\'ve seen every day that he\\'s served our country in the white house. i also told you about our daughters, how they are the heart of our hearts, the center of our world and during our time in the white house, we\\'ve had the joy of watching them grow from bubbly little girls into poised young women. a journey that started soon after we arrived in washington, when they set off for their first day at their new school. i will never forget that winter morning as i watched our girls .\n just 7 and 10 years old, pile into those black suvs with all those big men with guns. and i saw their little faces pressed up against the window and the only thing i could think was, \""what have we done?\"" see, because at that moment, i realized that our time in the white house would form the foundation for who they would become. and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them. that is what barack and i think about every day, as we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight. how we urge them to ignore those who question their father\\'s citizenship or faith. how we insist that the hateful .\n language they hear from public figures on tv does not represent the true spirit of this country. how we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you don\\'t stoop to their level. no, our motto is, when they go low, we go high. with every word we utter, with every action we take, we know our kids are watching us. we, as parents, are their most important role models. and let me tell you, barack and i take that same approach to our jobs as president and first lady, because we know that our words and actions matter, not just to our girls, but the children across this country. kids -- kids who tell us, i saw you on tv. i wrote a report on you for school. kids like the little black boy .\n who looked up at my husband, his eyes wide with open and he wondered, is my hair like yours? and make no mistake about it, this november, when we go to the polls, that is what we\\'re deciding. not democrat or republican, not left or right, no, in this election and every election, is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives. and i -- i am here tonight because in this election, there is only one person who i trust with that responsibility. only one person who i believe is truly qualified to be president of the united states. and that is our friend, hillary clinton. .\n that\\'s right. see, i trust -- i trust hillary to lead this country, because i\\'ve seen her life-long devotion to our nation\\'s children. not just her own daughter, who she has raised to perfection, but -- but every child who needs a champion. kids who take the long way to school to avoid the gangs. kids who wonder how they\\'ll ever afford college. kids whose parents don\\'t speak a word of english, but dream of a better life. kids who look to us to determine who and what they can be. you see, hillary has spent decades doing the relentless, thankless work to actually make a difference in their lives. .\n advocating for kids with disabilities as a young lawyer, fighting for children\\'s health care as first lady and for quality child care in the senate. and when she didn\\'t win the nomination eight years ago, she didn\\'t get angry or disillusioned. she -- hillary did not -- hillary did not pack up and go home. because as a true public servant, hillary knows that this is so much bigger than her own desires and disappointments. so -- she proudly stepped up to serve our country once again as secretary of state, traveling the globe to keep our kids safe. .\n and, look -- there were plenty of moments when hillary could have decided that this work was too hard, that the price of public service was too high, that she was tired of being picked apart for how she looks or how she talks or even how she laughs. but here\\'s the thing. what i admire most about hillary is that she never buckles under pressure. she never takes the easy way out. and hillary clinton has never quit on anything in her life. and when i think about the kind of president that i want for my girls and all our children, that\\'s what i want. i want someone with the proven strength to persevere. someone who knows this job and .\n takes it seriously. someone who understands that the issues a president faces are not black and white and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters. look, because -- because when you have the nuclear codes at your fingertips and the military in your command, you can\\'t make snap decisions. you can\\'t have a thin skin or a tendency to lash out. you need to be steady and measured and well-informed. i want a president with a record of public service, someone whose life work shows our children that we don\\'t chase fame and fortune for ourselves, we fight .\n to give everyone a chance to succeed. and we give back, even when we\\'re struggling ourselves, because we know that there is alwa always, and there but for the grace of god go i. i want a president who will teach our children that everyone in this country matters. a president who truly believes in the vision that our founders put forth all those years ago, that we are all created equal, each, a beloved part of the great american story. and when crisis hits, we don\\'t turn against each other. no, we listen to each other. we lean on each other. because we are always stronger together. and i am here tonight, because i know that that is the kind of .\n president that hillary clinton will be, and that\\'s why, in this election, i\\'m with her. you see, hillary understands that the president is about one thing and one thing only. it\\'s about leaving something better for our kids. that\\'s how we\\'ve always moved this country forward, by all of us coming together on behalf of our children. folks who volunteer to coach that team, to teach that sunday school class, because they know it takes a village. heroes of every color and creed who wear the uniform and risk their lives to keep passing down those blessings of liberty, police officers and protesters .\n in dallas who all desperately want to keep our children safe. people who lined up in orlando to donate blood because it could have been their son, their daughter, in that club. leaders like tim kaine who sh show -- who show our kids what decency and devotion look like. leaders like hillary clinton, who has the guts and the grace to keep coming back and putting those cracks in that highest and hardest glass ceiling until she finally breaks through. lifting all of us along with her. that is the story of this country. the story that has brought me to .\n this stage tonight. the story of generations of people who felt the lash of bondage, the shame of servitude, the sting of segregation, but who kept on striving and hoping and doing what needed to be done so that today, i wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. and -- and i watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligence black young women playing with their dogs on the white house lawn. and because of hillary clinton, my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the united states. .\n so, look. so -- don\\'t let anyone ever tell you that this country isn\\'t great. that somehow we need to make it great again. because this, right now, is the greatest country on earth. and as my daughters prepare to set out into the world, i want a leader who is worthy of that truth. a leader who is worthy of my girls\\' promise and all our kids\\' promise. a leader who will be guided every day by the love and hope .\n and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children. so, in this election, we cannot sit back and hope that everything works out for the best. we cannot afford to be tired or frustrated or cynical. no, hear me. between now and november, we need to do what we did eight years ago and four years ago. we need to knock on every door. we need to get out every vote. we need to pour every last ounce of our passion and our strength and our love for this country into electing hillary clinton as president or the united states of america. so, let\\'s get to work. thank you, all. and god bless. .\n >> first lady michelle obama. polished, passionate and personal. said that only one person is truly qualified to be president of the united states, that is hillary clinton. did not mention donald trump\\'s name once, jon karl, but hard to argue that it wasn\\'t a speech against donald trump. >> that may have been the most effective, one of the harshest speeches we\\'ve heard against donald trump during the course of this campaign. she said, in that culmination, don\\'t let anybody tell you this country isn\\'t great. that we need to make america great again. this country, right now, is the greatest country on earth. >> got choked up as she talked about her daughters and the prospect of hillary clinton being the first woman president. david muir down there on the floor. cecilia vega told us earlier, a house divided. not during that speech. >> i got to tell you, george, we saw stronger together, those signs and michelle obama, what a temperature shift in this room. .\n we\\'ve been down on the floor all day and earlier today, the bernie supporters were up against the hillary supporters, but everyone in this room was listening to michelle obama. and you should see the purple signs all throughout this convention hall. one word is all you need when it comes to her. and as you pointed out, this was a very personal speech, george. chef talked about this through the prism of being a parent. remembering her little girls when they were young and saying that the person we elect will be the person that shapes our children not only for the next four, but possibly eight years and that is the sole reason that will drive here in november november. >> okay, david muir, thank you so much. elizabeth warren and bernie sanders are coming up when we come back. abc news coverage of the democratic national convention will return in a moment. .\n back live in philadelphia, here again is george stephanopoulos. >> and we are back in philadelphia right now. elizabeth karen, senator elizabeth warren coming up any minute. she\\'s being introduced by joe kennedy. matthew dowd mehere we many all year long. senator warren played coy with hillary clinton. boy, she doesn\\'t hold back when she talks about donald trump. >> no, she doesn\\'t. she actually played coy because she thought about running for president. michelle obama mentioned 140 characters on twitter -- elizabeth warren has used twitter in the last six months to get under donald trump\\'s .\n skin. and she\\'s done that because donald trump has actually gone to name-calling directly to elizabeth warren. >> she\\'s good at name-calling. you look at the things she\\'s said. a small insecure money grubber. a thin skin racist bully. she\\'s unleashed some doozies on her own. >> you think that was passionate from michelle obama, wait until elizabeth warren. >> the progressives in the crowd, their heart has been with elizabeth warren, as well. let\\'s listen to congressman joe kennedy as he brings her to the stage. >> senator warren is an aboncho for the voiceless and victimized. she asks more from all of us because she believes deeply in each of us. that faith in our country and the american people is the very foundation of our democratic party. it echoes through this arena .\n tonight and to every classroom, living room and hearing room that senator elizabeth warren has ever touched. ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce to you, your senator, my senator, our senator, senator elizabeth warren. >> big hug as senator warren takes the podium. ready to fire up this crowd. >> thank you. oh, i love that. thank you! thank you. thank you, joe. and thank you, massachusetts, for the great honor of serving as your senator. thank you, guys. .\n what a night. wow. michelle obama, cory booker? and we still have bernie coming up. bernie reminds us what democrats fight for every day. thank you, bernie. thank you. now, we are here tonight because america faces a choice. the choice of a new president. on one side is a man who inherited a fortune from his father and kept it going by cheating people, by skipping out on debts. a man who has never sacrificed anything for anyone. a man who cares only for hims f himsehimsel himself, every minute of every day. .\n on the other side is one of the smartest, toughest, most tenacious people on this planet. a woman who fights for children, for women, for health care, for human rights. a woman who fights for all of us and who is strong enough to win those fights. we\\'re here today because our choice is hillary clinton, i\\'m with hillary. i\\'m with hillary. i\\'m with hillary. you know -- for me, this choice is personal. it\\'s about who we are as a people, it\\'s about what kind of a country we want to be. i grew up in oklahoma. my daddy ended up as a maintenance man, and my mom worked minimum wage job at sears. my three brothers served in the .\n military. the oldest was career, 288 combat missions in vietnam. the second worked construction. and the third started his own small business. me? i got married at 19, graduated from a commuter college in texas that cost $50 a semester. the way i see it, i\\'m a janitor\\'s daughter who became a public schoolteacher, a professor and a united states senator. america is truly a country of opportunity. truly. i am deeply grateful to that america. i believe in that america. but i\\'m worried. i\\'m worried that my story is locked in the past. worried that opportunity is slipping away for people who work hard and play by the rules. i mean, look around. .\n americans bust their tails, some working two or three jobs, but wages stay flat. meanwhile, the basic costs of making it from month to month keep going up, housing, health care, childcare, the costs are out of sight. young people are getting crushed by student loans, working people are in debt, seniors can\\'t stretch a social security check to cover the basics. and even families who are okay today worry it could all fall apart tomorrow. this is not right. it is not. and here\\'s the thing. america isn\\'t going broke. the stock market is breaking records. corporate profits are at all-time highs. ceos make tens of millions of dollars. there\\'s lots of wealth in america, but it isn\\'t trickling .\n down to hard-working families like yours. does anyone here have a problem with that? yeah, well, i do, too. people get it. the system is rigged. you know -- it\\'s true. now -- so-called experts claim america is in trouble because both political parties in washington refuse to compromise. grid lock. that is just flat wrong. washington works great for those at the top. when giant companies wanted more tax loopholes, washington got it done. when huge energy companies wanted to tear up our environment, washington got it done. when enormous wall street banks wanted new regulatory loopholes, .\n washington got it done, no gridlock there. but try to do something, anything, for working people, and you\\'ll have a fight on your hands. democrats have taken on those fights, that\\'s what we do. democrats fought to get health insurance for more americans. democrats fought for a strong consumer agency so big banks can\\'t cheat people. we fought, we won and we improved the lives of millions of people. thank you, barack obama. yes, we won, but republicans and lobbyists battled us every step of the way. five years later, that consumer .\n agency has returned $11 billion to families who were cheated. and republicans? republicans, they\\'re still trying to kill it. now, look. i\\'m not someone who thinks that republicans are always wrong and democrats are always right. there\\'s enough blame to go around. but there is a huge difference between people fighting for a level playing field and the people fighting to keep the system rigged. look at congress. since the republicans took over. democrats proposed refinancing student loans. and republicans? they said, no. democrats proposed ending tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas. and republicans? they said, no. democrats proposed raising the minimum wage. and republicans? they said, no. .\n so, to every republican in congress who said no, this november, the american people are coming for you. yes. that\\'s right. and where was donald trump in all these fights? not once did he lift a finger to help working people. and why would he? his whole life has been about taking advantage of that rigged system. time after time, he preyed on working people. people in debt, people who had fallen on hard times. he\\'s conned them, he\\'s defrauded them and it\\'s ripped them off. .\n look at his history. donald trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of american families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap. donald trump set up a fake university to make money by cheating people and taking their life savings. donald trump goes on and on and on about being a successful businessman. but he filed business bankruptcy six times, always to protect his own money and stick the investors and contractors with the bill. donald trump hired plumbers and painters and construction workers to do hard labor for his businesses, then he told them to take only a fraction of what he owed or fight his lawyers in court for years. .\n so, what kind of a man acts like this? what kind of a man roots for an economic crash that cost millions of people their jobs? their homes, their life savings? what kind of a man cheats students, cheats investors, cheats workers? well, i\\'ll tell you what kind of a man. a man who must never be president of the united states. never. and we\\'ve got the leaders to make it happen. hillary clinton and tim kaine. they\\'re going to make it happen. you bet. look. .\n donald trump knows that the american people are angry. a fact so obvious he can see it from the top of the trump tower. so, now, he\\'s insisting that he and he alone can fix the rigged system. last week, donald trump spoke for more than an hour on the biggest stage he\\'s ever had but other than talking about building a stupid wall, which will never get built -- other than that wall, did you hear any actual ideas? did you hear even one solid proposal from trump for increasing income or improving your kids\\' education? or creating even one single .\n good-paying job? look. let\\'s face it. donald trump has no real plans for jobs or for college kids or for seniors. no plans to make anything great for anyone except rich guys like donald trump. just look at his ideas. donald trump wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage. donald trump wants to roll back financial regulations and turn wall street loose to wreck our economy again. and donald trump has a tax plan to give multimillionaires and billionaires like himself an average tax cut of $1.3 million a year. you know, you\\'re struggling to put your kids through college and donald trump thinks he needs a million-dollar tax break? trump\\'s entire campaign is just .\n one more late night trump infomerci infomercial. hand over your money, your jobs, your children\\'s future and the great trump hot air machine will reveal all the answers. and for one low, low price, he\\'ll even throw in a goofy hat. and here\\'s the really ugly underside to his pitch. trump thinks he can win votes by fanning the flames of fear and hatred by turning neighbor against neighbor. by persuading you that the real problem in america is your fellow americans. people who don\\'t look like you or don\\'t talk like you or don\\'t worship like you. he even picked a vice president famous for trying to make it legal to openly diskrcriminate .\n against gays and lesbians. that\\'s donald trump\\'s america. an america of fear and hate. an america where we all break apart. whites against blacks and latinos, christians against muslims and jews, straight against gay, everyone against immigrants, race, religion, heritage, gender, the more factions, the better. but ask yourself this -- when white workers in ohio are pitted against black workers in north carolina, or latino workers in florida, who really benefits? divide and conquer is an old story in america. dr. martin luther king knew it. after his march from selma to montgomery, he spoke of how segregation was created to keep people divided. instead of higher wages for .\n workers, dr. king described how poor whites in the south were fed jim crow, which told a poor white worker that, quote, no matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man, better than the black man. racial hatred was part of keeping the powerful on top. when we turn on each other, bankers can run our economy for wall street, oil companies can fight off clean energy and giant corporations can ship the last good jobs overseas. when we turn on each other, rich guys like trump can push through more tax breaks for themselves and then we\\'ll never have enough money to support our schools or rebuild our highways or invest in our kids\\' futures. when we turn on each other, we .\n can\\'t unite to fight back against a rigged system. well, i\\'ve got news for donald trump. the american people are not falling for it. we\\'ve seen this ugliness before. and we are not going to be donald trump\\'s hate-filled america. not now, not ever. this is about our values. about our shared values with our candidates, hillary clinton and tim kaine. let\\'s talk about those values. we believe that no matter who you are, no matter where you\\'re from, no matter who you love, equal means equal. hillary will fight to make sure discrimination has no place in .\n america and we\\'re with her. we believe that no one -- no one who works full-time should live in poverty. hillary will fight for raising the minimum wage, fair scheduling, paid family and medical leave and we\\'re with her. we believe every kid in america should have a chance for a great education without getting crushed by debt. hillary will fight for refinancing student loans and debt-free college. we are with her. and we believe that after a lifetime of hard work, seniors should be able to retire with .\n dignity. hillary will fight to expand social security, strengthen medicare and protect our retirement accounts and we\\'re with her. we believe that oil companies shouldn\\'t call the shots in washington, that science matters, that climate change is real. hillary will fight to preserve this earth for our chirp aldren grandchildren and we\\'re with her. we believe, and i can\\'t believe i have to say this in 2016, in equal pay for equal work and a woman\\'s right to control over her own body. hillary will fight for women and we\\'re with her. that\\'s right. .\n we believe we don\\'t need weaker rules on wall street, we need stronger rules, and when big banks get too risky, break them up. hillary will fight to hold big banks accountable, and we\\'re with her. and we believe that the united states should never, never sign trade deals that help giant corporations but leave workers in the dirt. hillary will fight for american workers, and we\\'re with her. okay. and just one more. just one more. we believe we must get big money out of politics and root out corruption. hillary will fight to overturn citizens united and return this government to the people. .\n if you believe that america must work for all of us, not just for the rich and powerful, if you believe we must reject the politics of fear and division, if you believe that we are stronger together, then let\\'s work our hearts out to make hillary clinton the next president of the united states. thank you. thank you. >> senator elizabeth warren, bringing the crowd to its feet there with the keynote speech at the democratic con vepgs. you saw bill clinton there. she defined donald trump in that speech, said he\\'s a man who thinks only of himself every minute of every day. had a litany, matthew dowd, what kind of a man is he? much more blunt than michelle obama, much more traditional and direct. >> full frontal attack on donald trump. .\n last week, former prosecutor chris christie prosecuted a case against hillary clinton, now former college professor elizabeth warren just graded the paper of donald trump. >> and terry moran, down on the floor, her we believe litany speaking directly to bernie sanders supporters and their issues. >> it has been completely raucous down here and this is ground zero. the california delegation, some of the most passionate sanders supporters. we hear some booing, some jeering. are you disrupting this convention or are you improving it, do you think? >> i think that we\\'re making our views known. i\\'m a sanders delegate, we haven\\'t even had an opportunity to vote for sanders yet here, nor has she been actually nominated yet. >> let me ask you, what\\'s more important to you? the principles that you followed bernie sanders for, or defeating donald trump in november? what would you say? >> i would say that no matter who gets elected president, we will -- we will stand by our .\n principles. i\\'m a nurse, i take care of patients, and the fact that this party hasn\\'t endorsed medicare for all is a grave mistake for my patients. when i go to work and take care of a kid with cancer, they better get health care and they don\\'t have that right. >> martha, thank you very much. that\\'s what we\\'re hearing across the floor. these pockets of intentise sands voters. >> a lot of strong feelings there. bernie sanders is next. we\\'ll be right back. abc news live coverage of the democratic national convent

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be \""carried out in handcuffs\"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.\nAsked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump\\'s prosecution, fellow candidate Sen.

The administration claimed that it wouldn\\'t separate families seeking asylum if they arrived at an official port of entry, as opposed to other parts of the border. But that didn\\'t hold true,\"" Harris wrote.\nDuring a 2019 interview with NPR , Harris spoke about her views on immigration, saying, \""I disagree with any policy that would turn America\\'s back on people who are fleeing harm. I frankly believe that it is contrary to everything that we have symbolically and actually said we stand for.\"".\n\""And so, I would not enforce a law that would reject people and turn them away without giving them a fair and due process to determine if we should give them asylum and refuge,\"" Harris added.\nIn June 2019, Harris once again spoke about her views during a Democratic primary debate, stating that if elected president, one of her first actions would be reinstating DACA. \""I will also immediately put in place a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum.

In response, Harris spoke about an experience she had visiting a private migrant detention facility. \""I saw children lined up single file based on gender being walked into barracks,\"" she said. \""The policies of [the Trump] administration have been facilitated by laws on the books that allow them to be incarcerated as though they\\'ve committed crimes.

The House is set to vote on a coronavirus relief package by the end of the week. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images .\nThe House Budget Committee has approved legislation advancing President Biden\\'s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package , setting a path for intense debate in the Senate.\nThe legislation is set for a vote on the House floor at the end of the week. The Senate is then expected to take up the legislation and attempt to modify it to ensure it can pass procedural hurdles while still satisfying all 50 Senate Democrats.\nRepublicans have generally rejected the need for such a sweeping relief package. Many, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., say Congress should wait to see the economic impact of the relief measures that were approved in December. Democrats, including Biden, have insisted that more relief is needed now, particularly for lower-wage workers and people who have been unable to find new jobs in the pandemic.\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki has told reporters that the legislation is aimed at helping people who are most at risk as the economy remains frozen by the virus.\nBut Senate Democrats remain split over some key elements, like a plan to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 over the next four years. Leaders are focused on working out any differences among Democrats before March 14, when current federal unemployment benefits are scheduled to expire.\nOver the weekend, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, told CNN he was \""confident\"" the Senate parliamentarian would determine that including such a measure falls within the strict rules of reconciliation.\nBiden has said he supports increasing the minimum wage, but is doubtful it can be passed through the Senate reconciliation process that only needs 51 votes.\nBut even if the parliamentarian rules that the measure can be included, there are two moderate Democrat senators who will likely push back: Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\nAnother round of stimulus checks: The latest round of direct payments would send $1,400 per person for people earning up to $75,000 and couples earning $150,000. The payments would be reduced for individuals earning over that amount but under $100,000 or more per year. The legislation also includes an additional $1,400 per dependent regardless of age.\nRental assistance: $25 billion for emergency rental assistance, including $5 billion for emergency housing vouchers for people experiencing homelessness, along with survivors of domestic violence and victims of human trafficking.\nExpanded and extended federal unemployment benefits: The additional federal unemployment benefits that most people who have lost jobs are currently receiving would be increased from $300 per week to $400 per week and extended through the end of August.\nNew financial support for parents : Democrats approved a major temporary overhaul to the child tax credit that could mean most families with children would receive monthly payments if the bill becomes law. The legislation increases the existing child tax credit to $3,000 for children 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under 6. The amount is gradually reduced for couples earning over $150,000 and individuals earning over $75,000 per year. Families eligible for the full credit would get payments of $300 per child, per month, from July 2021 through the end of the year.\nExpanded tax credits for low-income workers without children: The bill would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers. Anyone 19 or older earning up to $11,610 would be eligible for $1,502. The legislation would increase both the income threshold and the amount of the payment.\nChanges to Paycheck Protection Program: The bill includes $7.25 billion in new money for the PPP program and would allow more nonprofits to apply, including those groups that engage in advocacy and some limited lobbying. It also allows larger nonprofits to be eligible.\nRelief for restaurants and bars: The Small Business Administration would get $25 billion for a new grant program for \""restaurants and other food and drinking establishments.\"" Grants would be available up to $10 million per entity and $5 million per physical location with a maximum of 20 locations. The legislation sets aside $5 billion of the total money to be targeted to businesses with less than $500,000 in revenue in 2019.\nPublic health: $7.5 billion in funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track, administer and distribute the COVID-19 vaccines. Also included is $1 billion to educate the public on the vaccine in order to boost confidence in it. Forty-six billion dollars will go toward diagnosing and tracing COVID-19 infections. Nearly $2 billion would go toward buying and distributing various testing supplies and PPE.\nHigher education: $39 billion in grants to higher education institutions. Public and private nonprofit institutions receiving relief will be required to spend at least half of the funds on emergency financial aid grants to students.\nChild care and early childhood education funding: Nearly $15 billion in funds for the Child Care and Development Block Grant program to help support child-care facilities, particularly in high-need areas. There\\'s an additional $1 billion to the Head Start Program.\nSupport for low-income families: $4.5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families with home heating and cooling costs. One provision would give the secretary of agriculture the authority and funding to temporarily boost the value of cash vouchers for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) up to $35 per month for women and children for a four-month period during the pandemic.\nSupport for older Americans: $1.4 billion in funding for programs authorized under the Older Americans Act, including support for nutrition programs, community-based support programs and the National Family Caregiver Support Program.\nFood security: Maintains the 15% increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits through Sept. 30, 2021. Allocates $25 million to promote technological improvements to modernize the program. $37 million to be provided to the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for low-income seniors.\nTransportation: $30 billion for transit costs, including payroll and PPE. $8 billion for airports, $3 billion for temporary payroll support program to help support the aerospace manufacturing industry and $1.5 billion to recall and pay Amtrak employees who were furloughed because of the pandemic and to restore various daily routes. $15 billion would also be allocated to support workers in the airline industry."", ""evidence"": "" Highlights From The House Coronavirus Relief Package The legislation is set for a vote on the House floor at the end of the week."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.99486196""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meets with reporters before the House votes to pass a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Feb. 26, 2021.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-expected-pass-19-trillion-covid-19-relief/story?id=76141749"", ""title"": ""House passes $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package in party-line vote - ABC News"", ""full_text"": ""Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meets with reporters before the House votes to pass a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Feb. 26, 2021. J. Scott Applewhite/AP.\nThe House approved a massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package , advancing President Joe Biden's top agenda item and providing more resources to schools and businesses, boost funding for vaccinations and testing, and grant financial relief to Americans across the country.\nDemocrats passed the measure early Saturday morning in a party-line vote, with Republicans united against the bill calling for slimmer, more-targeted relief.\nThe Senate is expected to take up the legislation next week, after the chamber's parliamentarian ruled that Democrats could not include a $15 minimum wage in the proposal over budgetary concerns.\nHouse Democrats kept the provision in their version of the legislation, which will be taken up again before Congress can send it to the White House for Biden's signature by the middle of March, when federal unemployment benefits expire.\n\""This started almost a year ago,\"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said of the pandemic ahead of the House vote. \""Today's vote is a crucial step in our fight to defeat COVID-19.\"".\nThe American Rescue Plan would provide $1,400 stimulus checks to millions of Americans across the country and extend federal unemployment benefits through the summer. It would also provide hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to state and local governments, schools and vaccine and COVID-19 testing efforts -- in addition to nutritional and child care assistance.\nWhile Democrats and the White House have touted public polls showing broad bipartisan support for the measure, and the endorsements of state and local GOP leaders, House Republicans are expected to vote against the bill as a bloc. For weeks, they have argued that Democrats' proposal is too expensive and ignores the $4 trillion in coronavirus relief approved by Congress last year, some of which remains unspent.\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., criticizes Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the Democrats\\' $1.9 trillion COVID relief package, during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Feb. 26, 2021.\n\""This isn't a relief bill,\"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Friday. \""It takes care of Democrats' political allies while it fails to deliver for American families.\"".\nAmericans \""want us to actually work together, to come together and solve the problems in a bipartisan way,\"" Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio, said on the House floor. \""I think that message was clear. And the more the majority ignores it, the shorter their majority will be.\"".\nBiden briefly engaged with a group of 10 Senate Republicans pushing an alternative to his plan, but rejected their $600 billion counteroffer as too meager, arguing it did not meet the moment and would cut spending on key programs included in his legislation.\nDemocrats have advanced the coronavirus legislation using the budget reconciliation process, in a bid to avoid the Senate's 60-vote threshold and pass their package with a simple majority of votes, given the slim 50-50 divide in the upper chamber.\nOn Thursday night, the Senate parliamentarian told the Senate that the $15 minimum wage increase initially in the proposal would not meet the stringent budget rules of the reconciliation process and would have to be stripped out of the package for it to pass with a simple majority.\nProgressives erupted at the ruling, with some calling for Democrats to overrule the decision and others renewing their push to end the legislative filibuster in the chamber.\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., and Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., announced they would offer an amendment to the budget bill, once it comes over from the House, that would penalize \""large, profitable corporations\"" through the elimination of tax deductions\"" if those companies do not raise the minimum wage for their workers to \""at least $15 an hour.\"" The two chairmen also said that measure would offer incentives to small businesses to raise worker wages.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chairman of the Budget Committee, gestures prior to a U.S. Senate Budget Committee hearing regarding wages at large corporations on Capitol Hill, February 25, 2021 in Washington, D.C.\nAnother option that appeared to have been taken off the table by White House chief of staff Ron Klain was overruling Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, something that would take 51 votes in the Senate. If all Democrats were united in doing so, Vice President Kamala Harris could cast her tie-breaking vote to overrule MacDonough. But with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., opposing that action -- citing a need to protect the institution -- the need for Harris' vote appeared moot.\nMost Republicans have stood firm against raising the wage during the pandemic, citing potential harm to smaller businesses and workers, though a small handful, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, have offered a more modest proposal to increase the wage to $10 an hour while mandating that employers implement E-Verify, thereby blocking undocumented workers.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would still \""absolutely\"" pass the package without the minimum wage increase, and members of the caucus reaffirmed their commitment to the issue on Friday."", ""evidence"": ""Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meets with reporters before the House votes to pass a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Feb. 26, 2021."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.7480585""}, {""snippet"": ""<b> The Senate has reached a bipartisan deal to provide an additional $10 billion in Covid-19 assistance, less than half of what the White House originally had requested .</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/covid-19-aid-bill-whats-in-it/index.html"", ""title"": ""Covid-19 aid bill 2022: Here\\'s what\\'s in it | CNN Politics"", ""full_text"": "" \\t\\t Follow CNN Politics \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics The Biden Presidency Facts First US Elections Business Tech Media Success Perspectives Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Market Movers Fear & Greed World Markets Investing Markets Now Before the Bell Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Formula E Esports Hockey Videos Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features Weather Climate Storm Tracker Wildfire Tracker Video More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN .\n A nurse administers a second Covid-19 booster shot to a patient at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital on Friday, April 1, 2022, in Hines, Illinois. .\n The Senate has reached a bipartisan deal to provide an additional $10 billion in Covid-19 assistance, less than half of what the White House originally had requested . .\n It would allow the Biden administration to purchase more vaccines and therapeutics, as well as maintain testing capacity and research. But it does not include $5 billion in funding for global Covid-19 aid, nor would it replenish the program that pays for testing, treating and vaccinating the uninsured. .\n The deal would be paid for using unspent funds from the Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package , which was enacted in March 2021. .\n However, it would not draw from money previously provided for state and local government assistance . That proposed offset prompted several House Democrats to torpedo a $15.6 billion Covid-19 aid package that was initially part of the full-year spending bill . .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe urge Congress to move promptly on this $10 billion package because it can begin to fund the most immediate needs, as we currently run the risk of not having some critical tools like treatments and tests starting in May and June,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote in a statement Monday. .\n Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who was negotiating for the Republicans, each released the text and summaries of the deal. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the deal: .\n At least $5 billion would be spent on purchasing therapeutics, such as oral antivirals. Currently, there is a limited supply of treatments, including monoclonal antibodies, which are provided free of charge to Americans, regardless of insurance coverage. .\n The federal government has already scaled back on weekly allocations of many Covid-19 therapeutics due to both a lack of demand and a drop in available funding. Distribution of two monoclonal antibody treatments \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sotrovimab and bebtelovimab \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was scaled back \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause Congress has failed to provide additional funding for the Covid-19 response,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said in a statement to CNN last month. .\n In a fact sheet released last month, the White House said the federal government has no more funding to buy additional monoclonals, including a planned order for March 25. It also said it does not have the ability to purchase additional oral antiviral pills beyond the 20 million already secured. .\n Also, the additional funds from the deal would be used to purchase vaccines, including booster shots, vaccines for children and, potentially, new types of vaccines. The Biden administration has warned that second Covid-19 vaccine booster shots \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or a new type of vaccine, if needed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will not be free and readily available to all Americans, if and when they are authorized, without additional funding from Congress. .\n And the funds would be used to maintain testing capacity so that the manufacturing of at-home tests and lab capacity for PCR tests does not decline during the summer to the point where it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be ramped up again in the case of a future Covid-19 surge. .\n Among the ways to ensure testing is available in the future is for the federal government to purchase testing supplies from manufacturers or to provide funding to maintain state and local testing infrastructure. .\n Some $750 million would go to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for research, clinical trials and development of vaccines for emerging variants. It could also be used to expand vaccine manufacturing capacity as needed. .\n Without additional funding, the government will have to wind down some Covid-19 surveillance investments that help it detect the next variant, the White House has said. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how it will be paid for: .\n The $10 billion legislation would be fully offset by Covid-19 relief funds that were previously authorized by Congress but have not yet been spent, according to a summary provided by Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office . .\n Nearly $2 billion is left over from the Shuttered Venues Operators Grant program, which gave money to live music venues, theaters and museums that were forced to shut their doors for some period of time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The program stopped taking applications in August . It awarded more than $14 billion in grants. .\n The new bill would also repurpose about $900 million that is remaining for the Covid-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan advance program , which allowed some small businesses to receive up to $15,000 that did not need to be paid back. The program would be left with enough money to accommodate pending loan modifications and the recently announced six-month deferment on loan payments, according to a summary of the bill provided by Senate Democrats. .\n The new bill would use $1.6 billion of unspent funds that were previously given to the US Department of Agriculture by both the Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 coronavirus relief package, known as the American Rescue Plan Act, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, which was signed into law by then-President Donald Trump in 2020, according to a summary from Senate Democrats. .\n More than $2.3 billion would come from the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program , which provided funding to businesses to cover up to half of their payroll costs for certain categories of employees for up to six months. In return, those businesses were required to make several commitments, including to not involuntarily furlough or lay off employees within that group during the same six-month period. .\n The new bill would also use remaining unspent money in the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, totaling $500 million. That program provided funds to colleges so that they could give emergency financial aid grants to students whose lives were disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. .\n The relief package would rescind more than $1.8 billion from the $10 billion in Covid-19 relief funds provided to the State Small Business Credit Initiative Program.

This time around, the health pundits have spent considerable time spelling out the differences between the two scary diseases.\nMeasles, which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to wide vaccination, is a very different virus, explained CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Unlike Ebola, \""you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be that close to someone or kiss someone or anything like that\"" to pass it around.\n\""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s airborne,\"" she told Anderson Cooper on Feb. 2. \""If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person.\"".\nWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear back from Cohen when we reached out to CNN, but we found information from a reliable source that backs up her scenario.\nThe measles virus stays in the nose and throat mucus of someone who has the infection, so it makes sense that it is passed around through coughing and sneezing.\n\""Also, measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed,\"" the CDC says. \""If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.\"".\nPhysicians encourage the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine because it is very effective in preventing the virus from entering the body (and as we found, the\\xc2\\xa0 that it is safe).\nThe disease is so easy to catch, the CDC says, that if one person catches it, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune (i.e. did not have the vaccine due to a weak immune system, age or personal choice) close to the infected person will also become infected.\nWe can compare the contagion of each disease by examining the basic reproductive number, known as the R0. This refers to the average number of secondary infection cases stemming from one infected person in a \"" \"" uninfected population (if the population is vaccinated for, say, measles, the R0 basically disappears). As the R0 increases above 1, the disease spreads more widely.\nThe R0 of Ebola is around 2, meaning an average of two people catch the disease from one infected person during an outbreak. The measles has a much higher R0 of 18, higher than AIDS (R0 of 4), SARS (R0 of 4), or mumps (R0 of 10). NPR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Shots blog has a breaking down this concept.\nPut another way, \""Ebola\\'s got nothing\"" on the measles epidemic, wrote Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, in a recent Houston Chronicle .\nTroisi confirmed the accuracy of Cohen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement.

All other firearms \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as handguns \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can only be sold to individuals 21 or older. Buying semi-automatic weapons is legal in most states.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) , a division of the Justice Department, is responsible for administering the Gun Control Act. The ATF also regulates standards for issuing licenses to gun sellers.\nState and local officials can implement higher age restrictions on gun ownership but cannot implement lower age restrictions on gun ownership. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight to carry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d laws that determine whether a person can carry guns in public are decided by state and local governments. Background checks for gun purchases.\nA prospective buyer fills out ATF Form 4473 and the federally licensed firearms dealers relays this information to the NICS . NICS staff perform a background check to verify the prospective buyer does not have a criminal record and is not otherwise ineligible to purchase a firearm.\nThirty states, five US territories, and the Washington, DC rely on the FBI for background checks via the NICS. Seven states handle some background checks with the FBI in charge of specific types of transactions. The remaining 13 states, known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoint of contact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d states, rely on state law enforcement agencies for background checks. Gaps in current gun control laws.\nIn 1993, President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill into law, requiring federally licensed firearm dealers to conduct background checks on potential buyers. But one in five gun sales are conducted without a background check. Three of the most cited gaps in the federal gun laws are the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdefault proceed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboyfriend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gap, and the misdemeanor stalking gap. Default proceed.\nThe federal default proceed gap means that the government has three business days to conduct and finish their background check. If a firearm dealer has not been notified within three business days that a sale would violate federal or state laws, they may, by default, proceed with the sale.\nIn 2015, Dylann Roof murdered nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina with a handgun. An internal review by the FBI revealed complications with Roof\\xe2\\x80\\x99s background check which caused delays and allowed him to purchase his weapon despite a criminal record that should have blocked the sale. The boyfriend gap.\nFederal law prohibits domestic abusers from owning guns, but this only applies if the abuser has been married to, lived with, or had a child with their victims. Federal law does not prohibit abusive dating partners from purchasing firearms. This gap in the law has been implicated in the death of numerous women by current or former partners.\nTwenty states allow law enforcement officers to remove firearms when they arrive at the scene of a domestic violence incident. Several states have passed laws to partially or completely close this gap. The misdemeanor stalking gap.\nFederal law only prohibits people convicted of felony stalking offenses from accessing guns. Anyone convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses (e.g., stalking outside the context of a domestic relationship) is not prohibited from buying firearms. Several states have also passed laws to address this gap. .\n Agriculture Child & Social Services Climate Consumer & Employee Safeguards COVID-19 Defense & Military Economy Education Energy Environment & Natural Resources .\n Foreign Affairs Government Health Immigration & Border Security Our Changing Population Social Security & Medicare Standard of Living Veterans Wealth & Savings ."", ""evidence"": ""The checks are designed to stop people who aren't legally allowed to buy a gun, but gaps in the laws remain."", ""nli_class"": ""neutral"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.99545425""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>Under current federal law ( the Brady Act ), federally licensed firearms retailers must run a background check through the Federal Bureau of Investigation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (FBI) \u2013 National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) 1 on the buyer before transferring the firearm (new or used) to that individual.</b> The retailer must conduct the NICS check regardless of whether the transfer takes place at the licensed premises or at a gun show.

NSSF is the unified voice of our entire industry. .\nUnder current federal law ( the Brady Act ), federally licensed firearms retailers must run a background check through the Federal Bureau of Investigation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (FBI) \u2013 National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) 1 on the buyer before transferring the firearm (new or used) to that individual. The retailer must conduct the NICS check regardless of whether the transfer takes place at the licensed premises or at a gun show. Our industry has long supported the current NICS background check system.\nSome members of Congress and gun-control organizations now advocate expanding the Brady Act to require background checks for every firearm transfer in the United States between private citizens, whether it is a father passing his shotgun down to his son, a grandfather giving his granddaughter a Christmas gift of her first rifle, two private collectors transferring a rare and valuable firearm from one collection to another or loaning a friend a rifle or shotgun for a hunting trip.\nProponents of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUniversal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d background checks claim the measure solves the problem of access to firearms by prohibited persons but the glaring problem with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUniversal Background Checks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is they are unenforceable without a mandatory national firearm registry, which federal law expressly prohibits. Law abiding gun owners are well aware that historically firearm registration leads to confiscation.\nSo-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuniversal background checks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not only on private party firearm transactions impose heavy regulatory burdens on federally licensed retailers, add significant costs, pose logistical nightmares, lead to unacceptable delays in processing NICS checks, and open retailers to unprecedented liability exposure. Key Facts Gun Registries are Unlawful.\nCurrently, background checks are conducted for all retail sales by federally licensed firearm retailers (FFLs). That includes retail sales that occur at gun shows where a firearm is sold at a booth ran by the FFL or online firearm sales that are required to ship directly to an FFL for a background check. The only transfers remaining are private firearm sales which are legal in most of the United States. The glaring problem with universal background checks is they are unenforceable without a mandatory national firearm registry. Without knowing exactly who has the hundreds of millions of privately-owned firearms, it is impossible to control the flow of private sales.\nFederally, a national firearm registry is prohibited due to language in the 1986 Gun Control Act and the Brady Act of 1993, which led to the creation of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and made clear that NICS cannot be used to create a firearm registry. Gun control advocates know that failing universal background checks would be a precursor to justify modifying current legislation to achieve the goal of knowing where all the guns are. The problem is that even with a firearm registry, it would not stop criminals, nor reduce violent crime. Law-abiding citizens would register their firearms because they follow the law, and criminals would make sure to keep their guns off the list. According to the latest Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Survey of Prison Inmates, an estimated 287,400 prisoners possessed a firearm during their offense of which they are serving time. Of that population, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeven percent had purchased it under their own name from a licensed firearm retailer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2 Almost 80 percent of inmates acquired their firearms from nefarious sources. No Effect on Criminals.\nThe survey also found that over 80 percent of the state and federal inmates may have been prohibited from buying a firearm under federal law. Considering these figures, it is no surprise that criminals do not seek to purchase firearms from licensed retailers. In fact, this is confirmed by an extremely low NICS denial rate. In 2019, the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NICS system denied 103,592 firearm transfers, a denial rate of only 0.37 percent of the over 28 million NICS Firearm Background Checks.\nIf universal background checks were mandated, the question becomes whether criminals would change their behavior and instead choose to obtain firearms from FFLs that require a background check. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention review of the effectiveness of various firearm laws published in 2003, found no evidence this would happen. More recently, a 2013 Justice Department review of violence prevention studies found that even a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperfect universal background check system\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would not address the largest sources of crime guns. 3 Further, the study found that effectiveness would depend on \\xe2\\x80\\x9crequiring gun registration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAdditionally, evidence that a universal background check law would fail to limit access to firearms among prohibited populations can be found in an analysis of the implementation of the Brady Act. According to a 2000 study, there was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno evidence that implementation of the Brady Act was associated with a reduction in homicide rates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Confiscation Risk.\nUltimately, the goal of registration for antigun advocates is confiscation of law-abiding owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 firearms. The strategy is historically present in many countries as far back as Nazi Germany to modern day Australia, United Kingdom, Venezuela, and most recently, Canada. In the United States, disarming law-abiding citizens could be expedited by registration records that pinpoint gun owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 locations. After registration and confiscation, violent crime skyrockets for years because criminals know that none of their victims are armed. Afterall, most criminals get their firearms from the black market or steal them. Liability for FFLs.\nGun control proponents understand that universal background checks will not have a positive effect on reducing violent crime. Universal background checks are the first step in dismantling the Second Amendment and the firearm and ammunition industry. Forcing private party transactions to be processed through NICS creates serious concerns for heavily regulated firearm retailers and the increasingly strained NICS system. The proposed regulation puts increased liability on the federally licensed firearm retailer for selling firearms not in their inventory. If a private seller has made unsafe modifications to a firearm, and a retailer facilitates the transfer to a private buyer, the retailer would certainly be caught up in a liability suit. Additionally, there would be new regulations to account for firearms not already included in the FFL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s records. This new regulatory hurdle would likely have growing pains for both federal agencies and businesses. The risk is categorically higher for FFLs because paperwork violations, regardless of intent or amount, are grounds for license revocation.\nRather than enacting an ineffective new law that would severely impact the constitutionally-protected lawful commerce of firearms and infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans, the NSSF urges lawmakers to ensure that NICS has the proper resources to guarantee the background check system is operating effectively and efficiently as Congress intended it to work.\n1 Under the Brady Act, 13 states perform the background checks on all firearms (Point of Contact or POC states) and 8 states do the background check for the transfer of handguns only (Partial POC states). The state-performed background checks use the same federal databases as the FBI-NICS background checks. 2 https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/suficspi16.pdf 3 Greg Ridgeway, Ph.D., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSummary of Select Firearm Violence Prevention Strategies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d National Institute of Justice, Jan. 4, 2013.\n Brady Law \""Gun Show Loophole\"" Myth NICS & Point of Contact State Info Delayed NICS Transfers & the Fallacy of the \""Charleston Loophole\"" Universal Background Checks Federally Licensed Firearms Retailers Overwhelmingly Oppose \\'Universal Background Checks\\' Why the Firearms Industry Opposes so-called \""Universal Background Checks\"" .\nLicensed retailers must follow the same regulations and procedures, including conducting criminal background checks, when conducting business at gun shows just as they would if at their store or other place of business.

Anderson Cooper looks at both sides of the debate in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuns Under Fire: an AC360\\xc2\\xba Town Hall Special\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. .\n The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuniversal background checks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d now being pushed by some gun control supporters is code for closing federal loopholes on such checks at gun shows and other private sales. .\n U.S. law requires background checks for all people who try to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. But federal law does not require background checks for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprivate transactions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d like sales at gun shows. Many states have their own statutes requiring such checks for private sales. .\n The issue has risen high in the national conversation after the shock ignited by December\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mass shooting of six adults and 20 children at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. .\n Expanded background checks now enjoy the support of mayors in some of the largest cities in America. The idea has been embraced by gun violence survivor Gabrielle Giffords, a self-described gun owner. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also being considered for possible legislation by a White House task force led by Vice President Joe Biden. The task force is expected to include universal background checks as part of its recommended legislation. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis may be the single most important gun violence prevention measure that the government could adopt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lindsay Nichols, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis loophole means that dangerous criminals and dangerously mentally ill individuals have a most unfettered access to firearms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n But National Rifle Association President David Keene suggested to CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Candy Crowley that he has little faith in universal background checks , saying they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. .\n Keene spoke a few days after sitting in on the Biden task force. He implied that the task force wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sincerely considering NRA positions on gun control issues, saying they were simply \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchecking the box. They were able to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve met with the NRA. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve met with the people that are strong Second Amendment supporters.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9c .\n Later, the NRA issued a statement saying it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Keene did say he favored background checks to block people who may be mentally ill or potentially violent from buying guns. .\n One problem with the systems is that many states don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report the names of people who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been legally labeled dangerously mentally ill. .\n Improving the accuracy and availability of information about these people, Keene said, is one possible area for agreement. He suggested \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctightening up on putting information in the database. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school security. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beefing up the way we deal with the mentally ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Nichols said \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuge gaps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exist in the database, which is called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. For example, the Virginia Tech shooter, who killed 33 people and himself in 2007, had passed two background checks because Virginia didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t submit his mentally ill status to the database, Nichols said. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs a result of that shooting, the federal government passed a law encouraging these states to submit these records, and a large number of states passed laws. So there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been significant improvement in reporting dangerously mentally ill persons to NICS,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nichols said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut there are still about half of the states that report hardly any dangerously mentally ill people. They may not have the resources or the political will to enforce the law. Yeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crazy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Anytime someone buys a gun from a federally licensed gun dealer, the dealer is required to run a check on the buyer by submitting the name to the federal database. That database consists of criminal records and mental health records as provided by federal and state courts and agencies. .\n Convicted felons, people convicted of violent domestic crimes, and those determined by the courts to be dangerously mentally ill are prohibited by federal law from buying firearms, Nichols said. .\n Also, states have added their own categories of who is prohibited from buying a gun, Nichols said. For example, California prohibits gun ownership for people convicted of any kind of violent crime, drug offenses, alcohol abuse and juvenile offenses while underage, Nichols said. .\n Forty percent of all firearms purchased in the United States are sold without background checks because the guns aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t purchased from a federally licensed firearms dealer, Nichols said. .\n Rather, those weapons are bought at gun shows, on street corners, over the Internet or from friends or neighbors, Nichols said. .\n The NRA disputes that characterization about the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgun show loophole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because federally licensed firearms dealers participate at gatherings and, of course, conduct background checks. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what (is the) percentage at gun shows. It may be 10%,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Keene said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not such a loophole at gun shows. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like if you sell me your shotgun, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a private transaction. Just as if I sell you a car, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a dealer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s license.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Ten states and the District of Columbia have their own laws requiring background checks for any firearm sold at a gun show, Nichols said. .\n In total, 16 states and the District of Columbia require background checks on handguns sold at gun shows, Nichols said. .\n These states that close loopholes, however, provide exemptions for gun transfers between immediate family members and between licensed dealers, Nichols said. .\n From the time when the gun control measures of the Brady Act were enacted on March 1, 1994, through the end of 2008, the federal government processed more than 97 million applications for gun transfers or permits, the Justice Department says. .\n Added Nichols: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBackground checks have a huge deterrent effect. People who are ineligible to buy a gun are unlikely to try if they know they are going to be subjected to a background check.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics The Biden Presidency Facts First US Elections Business Markets Tech Media Success Perspectives Videos Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Formula E Esports Hockey Videos Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features Weather Climate Storm Tracker Wildfire Tracker Video More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN .\n Your CNN account Log in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts .\n\\xc2\\xa9 2023 Cable News Network.

In other words, did the funding in each area keep pace with inflation during Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure?\\xc2\\xa0.\nFor youth services, the Walton campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s analysis shows a 20 percent decrease in funding between 2017-18, the fiscal year when funding was highest - and 2021-22.\\xc2\\xa0.\nBut from Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first budget in 2006-07 to 2021-22, inflation-adjusted funding for youth services increased by 122 percent. The funding did not steadily increase throughout Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure. As Walton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign points out, the highest funding year was in 2017-18, and it has decreased by $678,492 since then.\\xc2\\xa0.\nFor senior services, the Walton campaign says that funding decreased by 16 percent between the highest year total and now, when budget figures are adjusted for inflation.\\xc2\\xa0.\nBut using the inflation-adjusted data from the Walton campaign, spending on senior services increased by 21 percent between Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first budget and his 2021-22 budget. Spending in this category fluctuated over time, and the year with the highest appropriations in this category was in 2020-21.\\xc2\\xa0.\nFor community centers, funding is difficult to discern for various reasons, Myerson said. But Myerson said some funding flows through the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parks and recreation facilities and activities budget, and in 2021-22, appropriations in this category are 6 percent less than they were in 2017-18, when funding was highest.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe parks and recreation budget remains higher in 2021-22 than in 2010-11, after the city took back control of city parks from Erie County.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe Brown administration said that since Brown took office, funding for community centers, pools, rinks, splash pads and senior and youth service programming has increased by millions of dollars.\\xc2\\xa0.\nFunding has not decreased in the city budget for two indoor pools and six youth-focused community centers, said Donna Estrich, commissioner of administration, finance, policy and urban affairs. Covid-19 closed facilities last year - not lack of funding.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe city did cut funding for outdoor pools, Estrich said, because the city anticipated that regular operations would not be feasible, both because of Covid-19 safety concerns and a national lifeguard shortage. The city reopened its indoor pools at varying capacities beginning in May, but has had trouble staffing them, despite a pay rate of $15 an hour, she said.\\xc2\\xa0.\nIn July, well before their Sept. 9 debate, Brown proposed spending $20 million in American Rescue Plan stimulus funds for the renovation of four community centers. The Common Council approved the stimulus plan Aug. 26.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWalton said Brown defunded certain city services: community centers, youth and senior programs, and that he shut down pools. Her comments could give the impression that Brown has methodically cut funding in these areas to levels not seen since before he was in office, or that he has cut funding in one area to spend it on another. There have been some budget fluctuations over Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure, including years when funding decreased, but even adjusted for inflation, spending in these categories is higher in the 2021-22 budget than when he took office.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False, because while it contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\\xc2\\xa0.\nCity of Buffalo adopted budget 2021-22 .

Read Full Bio .\nTwitter has for the very first time applied a new \""Manipulated Media\"" label to a tweet containing an edited video of presidential candidate Joe Biden.\nAs Politico reports (Opens in a new window) , the video was tweeted on Saturday by Dan Scavino, Director of Social Media at the White House, and subsequently viewed over 5 million times. It shows Joe Biden saying, \""We cannot win this re-election, excuse me, we can only re-elect Donald Trump.\"" President Trump shared the video twice, in one tweet stating \"" I agree with Joe! (Opens in a new window) \"".\nAnyone who watched the original video (Opens in a new window) on YouTube, however, will know Scavino shared an edited version. Biden\\'s statement in full was: \""We can only re-elect Donald Trump if, in fact, we get engaged in this circular firing squad here ... It\u2019s got to be a positive campaign, so join us.\"" Twitter classes the tweeted video as having been significantly altered and so applied the Manipulated Media label to the tweet.\nTwitter asked for help last year deciding on its manipulated media policy. The final version of that policy came into effect on March 5 and now we\\'re seeing it in action.\nThe same video has appeared on Facebook with no such label applied. Greg Shultz, campaign manager for Joe Biden, responded with the statement below as shared by CNN reporter Sarah Mucha in a tweet (Opens in a new window) :.\n\""We live in an era of increasingly rampant disinformation, and there are only two ways to address this toxic force that is corroding our democracy: responsibly and in a way that serves the public, or irresponsibly and in a nakedly self-serving manner. Facebook\u2019s malfeasance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false misinformation is a national crisis in this respect. It is also an unconscionable act of putting profit above not just our country, but every country. Facebook won\u2019t say it, but it is apparent to all who have examined their conduct and policies: they care first and foremost about money and, to that end, are willing to serve as one of the world\u2019s most effective mediums for the spread of vile lies. That is repugnant, and it should be called out for what it is. Their unethical behavior is not acceptable, and it must change.\"".\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

Before the New Hampshire Primary, Sen. Hillary Clinton was asked by the debate moderator to respond to comments that she had a powerful resume, impressive achievements, but she didn\\'t measure up on the \""likeability\"" scale. .\nHer response was charming. \""That hurts my feelings.\"" But her opponent, freshman Sen. Barack Obama scored a knockout with his ultra-cool rejoinder. \""Your likeable enough, Hillary.\"" You have to\\xc2\\xa0 see it. .\nClearly, she was trying to be more\\xc2\\xa0 in her debut as President Obama\\'s Secretary of State when she went to Geneva five years ago to meet with\\xc2\\xa0 Russia\\'s Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov. Madame Secretary presented the normally dour Slavic diplomat with a red plastic button. .\nAnd observers pointed out that the State Department types who had typed the word failed to write it in the Cyrillic alphabet. So, wrong word. Wrong alphabet. No big thing. .\nWe just want to be more likeable. The news media, of course, focused on all the goodwill, the yuk-yuk making, and the promise of a new era in U.S.-Russian relations. No more of that nasty George W. Bush. Now, we would all have a Rodney King foreign policy: Can\\'t we all just get along? .\nThe reset button was supposed to symbolize America\\'s willingness to wipe the 2008 slate clean. We would not hold Russia\\'s invasion of the Republic of Georgia against them. It was a short, sharp clash that only served to show the former Soviet satellite-in fact,\\xc2\\xa0 the former Soviet regions--that the Russian bear still had sharp claws and big teeth. .\nAs we look ahead, however, we will find that the reset button will figure more prominently. From that moment on, the Russian policy of this administration was to accommodate, temporize, forgive and forget. .\nIn 2010, President Obama met with then-President Dmitri Medvedev in suburban Washington for what was billed as a \""hamburger summit.\"" The two leaders mugged for the cameras and no one noticed that Medvedev was figuratively eating Obama\\'s lunch. .\nJust a few days later, ten Russian spies were arrested by the FBI. This untoward incident was not allowed to derail the reset, however. They were not whisked off to a black site for interrogation. No, they were escorted out of the country. They doubtless avoided even a TSA pat-down. .\nNow, historians of U.S.-Russian diplomacy may recall that in 1960, Soviet dictator Nikita Khrushchev raged at the Paris Summit when an American U-2 high altitude jet spy plane was shot down by a rocket. He railed at President Eisenhower. He demanded a cessation of all such flights. And a groveling apology, to boot. .\nIke resisted Khrushchev\\'s bullying-and our NATO allies rallied around him. Khrushchev put the U-2 pilot-the CIA\\'s Francis Gary Powers-on trial in Moscow and milked the incident for all it was worth. .\nFifty years later, the Russians could put\\xc2\\xa0 in America, they could be arrested and returned, and there was hardly a ripple of protest. .\nWhat can you expect when everything was supposed to have been \""reset\""? With this week\\'s action by the Russians in the Crimea, we can point to that adolescent stunt of Hillary\\'s in 2009. Struggling to be more likeable, she forgot the importance of being respected. .\nThe Russians are unlikely to respect a country that doesn\\'t respect itself. All of this brings back memories of the last U.S. administration so eager to be liked. Jimmy Carter spoke of the need to get over our \""inordinate fear of communism\"" and its lead sponsor, the USSR. The Soviets treated that speech like a starter\\'s pistol for a footrace. They ran rampant in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. .\nMr. Carter\\'s own pick as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Malcolm Toon, was a most competent professional diplomat with thirty years of experience. After the unlamented Carter administration was tossed out of office, Ambassador Toon said he had never feared war with the Soviet Union so much as when Carter was in office. The Georgian\\'s weakness was too tempting to the Kremlin bosses, Toon said. .\nWell, Georgia is always on our mind. We cannot reset reality. If you are looking for the source of Vladimir Putin\\'s power grab in the Crimea and Ukraine, you need look no further than Hillary\\'s bungled reset button. .\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe mission of the Media Research Center is to document and combat the falsehoods and censorship of the news media, entertainment media and Big Tech in order to defend and preserve America\\'s founding principles and Judeo-Christian values.

We need your help. .\n Says Hillary Clinton \""was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia.\"" .\nIf you want to get a rise from a Republican lawmaker, suggest that he or she shares some common ground with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., bristled when NBC host Chuck Todd suggested Cotton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign policy positions align more closely with Clinton than with Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump.\n\""I can assure you that I am not very close to Hillary Clinton,\"" Cotton responded. \""She has been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration. She was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia.\"".\nCotton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list of her failings continued, but his comment about Russia invading Georgia caught our eye, and we decided to look a little closer.\nbetween ethnic Georgians, South Ossetians and Abkhazians ebbed and flowed after the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1990. Under the USSR, South Ossetia and Abkhazia enjoyed substantial autonomy. Newly independent Georgian nationalists declared a unified nation with no internal borders.\nIn 1991, Georgian forces occupied the South Ossetian capital, but resistance by Russian-backed fighters led to a stalemate. In 1992, all parties agreed to a ceasefire, which included a Russian-led peacekeeping force. There was a similar pattern of hostilities in Abkhazia that resulted in a similar solution. The presence of peacekeepers and international monitors worked for about a decade.\nCalm unravelled in 2004 with the election of a more nationalist leader in Georgia. There was aggression on both sides. Violence grew and on Aug. 7, 2008, after Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia shelled ethnically Georgian villages, and the Georgian government sent in its army to take control of the region. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nClashes continued for a week, drawing in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Open conflict ended on Aug. 12, 2008. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step.\nNewly elected President Barack Obama had campaigned that he would put relations with Russia on a less confrontational footing. Most of his focus was on scaling back the nuclear arsenals of both nations. (He promised to win Russian agreement to continue the I Treaty that were due to expire in 2009.).\nAs part of that initiative, on March 6, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a red button. The button was supposed to have word \""reset\"" written on it in Russian. But the Americans got it wrong --\\xc2\\xa0the word translated to \"" .\"".\nRussian troops did participate in military activities on Georgian soil, but troops were already in place as part of a brokered peace settlement. And the Russians didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily initiate hostilities.\nAnd while Cotton said the Americans hit the \""reset\"" button \""a few months\"" after the Russian invasion, the reality is it took place almost six months after the week-long conflict had ended.\nSusan Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice\\xc2\\xa0at George Mason University, calls Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s action an invasion because in early August 2008, Russia didn\\'t\\xc2\\xa0consider\\xc2\\xa0South Ossetia to be an independent country.\nBut Allen told us that beyond that legal definition, the details muddy the picture. Georgia made the first large military move. On top of that, Russian soldiers were already on the ground in South Ossetia.\n\""Russia had had a longstanding role as part of a peacekeeping force separating the Georgians and South Ossetians,\"" Allen said. \""Yes, Russia invaded Georgia, and, yes, there is a lot more to the story.\"".\nLaw professor Kenneth Anderson at American University put a lot of weight on the rest of the story. Right after the ceasefire, Anderson urged western powers to push back hard against Russian expansionism. But he reminded people of the ethnic cleansing that took place at the hands of Georgian nationalists in the 1990s, saying it was as extreme as anything he had seen in the war in the former Yugoslavia.\n\""The facts of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not simply a narrative of Russia stirring up trouble in an otherwise untroubled corner of the world,\"" Anderson . \""This conflict got started 15 years ago, and although on again and off again, it has never stopped. \\xc2\\xa0Neither its existence nor its persistence are due to Russian imperial expansion alone.\"".\nFor Cotton to bring up Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invasion of Georgia might invoke more recent memories of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear aggression in Ukraine when it seized control of the Crimean peninsula. But the circumstances were quite different, as was the western reaction. The Crimean seizure produced hard sanctions against Russia, including expulsion from the G-8. In contrast, in 2008, the George W. Bush administration made only cautious moves to register its disapproval of Russia.\nDavid L. Phillips, director of Columbia University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s program on peace-building and rights, in 2014 that \""there was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that.\"".\nRegarding the impact of the \""reset\"", some observers say it helped. Political scientist\\xc2\\xa0Andrew Kuchins at the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in 2011 that relations between Russia and America \""steadily improved.\"" Kuchins credits the diplomatic shift with producing a new START treaty and winning Russian support for stronger sanctions against Iran.\nCotton shrinks the timeframe and oversimplifies the nature of the Russian action. Yet, while imperfect, his words are not necessarily an inaccurate retelling of history.\n Kari Lake has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgone on the record saying she supports Arizona\\'s complete abortion ban.

She simply spoke about a colleague seeking help for addiction issues.\"".\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as though Vukmir\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter would have been seen by the judge as urging a harsher sentence for Kramer rather than a lighter one.\nCriminal defense lawyer Jerome Buting , known for his work on the case made famous by the film \""Making a Murderer,\"" said Vukmir\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter does seek leniency:.\nIf you write a letter on behalf of a defendant at sentencing, most of the time I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasonable to assume that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seeking leniency, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expressed that way or not. You\\'re trying to convey to the judge that this one incident doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily portray everything about his (the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) character, and that is one of the big factors the court has to consider in sentencing.\nPaul Bucher , who does criminal defense work and is the former district attorney in Waukesha County, disagreed, saying some letters explicitly ask for leniency or no jail time and Vukmir\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doesn\\'t:.\nWe do character letters all the time because all the court really knows about the client is what is in the criminal complaint. So, the job of a defense \\xc2\\xa0lawyer is to give the judge a broader picture of who is standing in front of him. (Vukmir\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter is) a pretty standard, boilerplate, character letter. \\xc2\\xa0.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fair to say that letters written on behalf of criminal defendants facing sentencing cover a range. Vukmir\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter to the judge in Kramer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case is limited to Kramer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s character. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go as far as some letters in such cases that explicitly ask for leniency or lighter treatment, such as probation rather than jail.\nBut while the word leniency might mean different things to different people, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear that Vukmir\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter was written to benefit Kramer \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in other words, seeking a lighter sentence, rather than a harsher one.\nEditor\\'s note: This item was corrected on July 18, 2018, after it was first published, to clarify the Club for Growth entities.\n At a Wisconsin school, a 12-year-old girl \""was transitioned into a boy by school officials without parental consent,\"" and Protasiewicz supports it. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe gay dating app Grindr says if Florida doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop passing homophobic and transphobic laws, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll reveal every Republican legislator and party official who secretly uses the app.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ."", ""evidence"": ""The letter was sent on behalf of then-Rep.

In a recent tweet, the Republican National Committee blamed rising crime on Democrats.\n\""Crime is escalating to a level we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies,\"" Republicans tweeted June 29 .\nCrime is escalating to a level we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies. June 29, 2021.\nWe asked the RNC for the data behind the claims in the tweet. Their response included nothing on the link to police defunding. On the open border part, they pointed to news coverage about an increase in fentanyl seizures at the border, high-speed chases in South Texas, and FBI director Christopher Wray talking about an epidemic of drug smuggling and other illegal activity at the border.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe RNC tweet is rife with inaccuracies. But its biggest flaw is the unfounded assertion that crime rate trends were a \""direct result\"" of Democratic policies.\n\""Open-border policies\"": The articles the RNC cited said nothing linking activity at the border to a spike in the national incidence of murders or other crimes. We found no independent research that argued that point.\nCriminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah noted that when murders began to increase rapidly in mid-2020, immigration was stable or declining.\n\""And, obviously, Democrats did not control immigration policy in May 2020,\"" Cassell said. \""So any linkage between the 2020 homicide increase and immigration policies seems quite dubious.\"".\nHistoric highs: The RNC tweet talked about crime reaching levels not seen in decades. Not only do they lack the data to confirm that, but based on the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest available data for homicides and other preliminary data, the U.S. is not on pace to reach the heights seen in the mid-1990s.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""Defund the police\"": \\xc2\\xa0The RNC tweet suggested that \""defund the police\"" is a core Democratic policy. It is not. A handful of Democrats have spoken out for it, but during the 2020 campaign, candidate Joe Biden rejected the movement. And his 2022 budget requested an increase of $304 million for police to build ties within the communities they patrol.\nSome Democratic-led cities did cut police budgets last year, but not many. Among the 50 largest cities , police spending as a percentage of general expenditures went up an average of 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021.\nThe RNC tweet speaks of crime broadly, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homicides in particular that have caused alarm since a sharp rise in the summer of 2020. That coincided with the anti-police-violence protests that spread across the country in June following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The calls to defund the police gained prominence the same month.\nOne problem in talking about crime at this moment is that no one yet has a national picture of crime for 2020, let alone the first half of 2021. The FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual Uniform Crime Report is the most comprehensive data set, and the FBI hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t published the 2020 edition yet.\\xc2\\xa0.\nOther data sets lack the scope of the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full assessment, but they all point in the same direction: Homicides are up.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nA preliminary FBI crime report for 154 cities says murders rose 10% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. The Major Cities Chiefs Association found a 29% rise in homicides for 63 cities in the first quarter of 2021. And the latest report from Council on Criminal Justice , an independent source of crime data, looked at 24 cities and found homicides rose by 24% in the first quarter.\nFor example, in the first-quarter FBI release on 154 cities, the increase in homicides was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As for violent crime generally \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the number remained just about the same across the full group of cities, undercutting the RNC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broad-brush claim about escalating crime.\nThe Council on Criminal Justice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data on weekly police reports found that homicide rates generally fell after October 2020 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from a bit over 5 deaths per 100,000 to about 3 per 100,000 by March 2021.\nThat could reflect seasonal changes; homicides tend to fall in the cooler months. But the report\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authors say other unknown factors could be at work.\nThe RNC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that rising crime was a \""direct result\"" of Democratic policies lacks evidence, and experts say it ignores some of the major events of 2020 that also likely had an effect on crime.\n\""The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,\"" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. \""Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.\"".\nOn top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the death of George Floyd.\nCassell at the University of Utah said that played a role, because it made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.\nCassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect. Regardless, Cassell called the GOP link between crime and a defund policy \""dubious.\""\\xc2\\xa0.\nEven the pandemic and the protests might not fully explain the trend in homicides. As the Council on Criminal Justice report noted, the \""homicide increase actually began in 2019, prior to the pandemic and well before protests against police violence spread across the country.\"".\nLooking at the first three months of 2020, murders rose 20% from a year earlier. The pandemic shutdown didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take place until mid-March, and the protests didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t begin until late May.\nThe Republican National Committee tweeted that \""crime is escalating to a level we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.\"".\nHomicides are up, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no evidence that the trend is tied to a police defunding policy or Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 border policies, let alone that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \""direct result.\"".\nSJ Quinney College of Law, University of Utah, Explaining the Recent Homicide Spikes in U.S. Cities: The 'Minneapolis Effect' and the Decline in Proactive Policing , September 2020.\nWhite House, Biden-Harris Administration Announces Comprehensive Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gun Crime and Ensure Public Safety , June 23. 2021.\n Kari Lake has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgone on the record saying she supports Arizona\\'s complete abortion ban.

Beginning in late 2007 and lasting until mid-2009, it was the longest and deepest economic downturn in many countries, including the United States, since the Great Depression (1929\\xe2\\x80\\x93 c. 1939).\n \\t\\t December 2007 - June 2009 (Show more) \\t\\t United States (Show more) \\t\\t mortgage subprime mortgage financial crisis of 2007\\xe2\\x80\\x9308 austerity subprime lending (Show more) \\t\\t \\t.\nThe financial crisis, a severe contraction of liquidity in global financial markets, began in 2007 as a result of the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble. From 2001 successive decreases in the prime rate (the interest rate that banks charge their \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprime,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or low-risk, customers) had enabled banks to issue mortgage loans at lower interest rates to millions of customers who normally would not have qualified for them ( see subprime mortgage ; subprime lending ), and the ensuing purchases greatly increased demand for new housing, pushing home prices ever higher. When interest rates finally began to climb in 2005, demand for housing, even among well-qualified borrowers, declined, causing home prices to fall. Partly because of the higher interest rates, most subprime borrowers, the great majority of whom held adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), could no longer afford their loan payments. Nor could they save themselves, as they formerly could, by borrowing against the increased value of their homes or by selling their homes at a profit. (Indeed, many borrowers, both prime and subprime, found themselves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderwater,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning that they owed more on their mortgage loans than their homes were worth.) As the number of foreclosures increased, banks ceased lending to subprime customers, which further reduced demand and prices.\nAs the subprime mortgage market collapsed, many banks found themselves in serious trouble, because a significant portion of their assets had taken the form of subprime loans or bonds created from subprime loans together with less-risky forms of consumer debt ( see mortgage-backed security ; MBS). In part because the underlying subprime loans in any given MBS were difficult to track, even for the institution that owned them, banks began to doubt each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s solvency, leading to an interbank credit freeze, which impaired the ability of any bank to extend credit even to financially healthy customers, including businesses. Accordingly, businesses were forced to reduce their expenses and investments, leading to widespread job losses, which predictably reduced demand for their products, because many of their former customers were now unemployed or underemployed. As the portfolios of even prestigious banks and investment firms were revealed to be largely fictional, based on nearly worthless (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctoxic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) assets, many such institutions applied for government bailouts, sought mergers with healthier firms, or declared bankruptcy . Other major businesses whose products were generally sold with consumer loans suffered significant losses. The car companies General Motors and Chrysler , for example, declared bankruptcy in 2009 and were forced to accept partial government ownership through bailout programs. During all of this, consumer confidence in the economy was understandably reduced, leading most Americans to curtail their spending in anticipation of harder times ahead, a trend that dealt another blow to business health. All these factors combined to produce and prolong a deep recession in the United States. From the beginning of the recession in December 2007 to its official end in June 2009, real gross domestic product (GDP)\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., GDP as adjusted for inflation or deflation \\xe2\\x80\\x94declined by 4.3 percent, and unemployment increased from 5 percent to 9.5 percent, peaking at 10 percent in October 2009.\nAs millions of people lost their homes, jobs, and savings, the poverty rate in the United States increased, from 12.5 percent in 2007 to more than 15 percent in 2010. In the opinion of some experts, a greater increase in poverty was averted only by federal legislation, the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which provided funds to create and preserve jobs and to extend or expand unemployment insurance and other safety net programs, including food stamps. Notwithstanding those measures, during 2007\\xe2\\x80\\x9310 poverty among both children and young adults (those aged 18\\xe2\\x80\\x9324) reached about 22 percent, representing increases of 4 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Much wealth was lost as U.S. stock prices\\xe2\\x80\\x94represented by the S&P 500 index\\xe2\\x80\\x94fell by 57 percent between 2007 and 2009 (by 2013 the S&P had recovered that loss, and it soon greatly exceeded its 2007 peak). Altogether, between late 2007 and early 2009, American households lost an estimated $16 trillion in net worth; one quarter of households lost at least 75 percent of their net worth, and more than half lost at least 25 percent. Households headed by younger adults, particularly by persons born in the 1980s, lost the most wealth, measured as a percentage of what had been accumulated by earlier generations in similar age groups. They also took the longest time to recover, and some of them still had not recovered even 10 years after the end of the recession. In 2010 the wealth of the median household headed by a person born in the 1980s was nearly 25 percent below what earlier generations of the same age group had accumulated; the shortfall increased to 41 percent in 2013 and remained at more than 34 percent as late as 2016. Those setbacks led some economists to speak of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clost generation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of young persons who, because of the Great Recession, would remain poorer than earlier generations for the rest of their lives.\nLosses of wealth and speed of recovery also varied considerably by socioeconomic class prior to the downturn, with the wealthiest groups suffering the least (in percentage terms) and recovering the soonest. For such reasons, it is generally agreed that the Great Recession worsened inequality of wealth in the United States, which had already been significant. According to one study, during the first two years after the official end of the recession, from 2009 to 2011, the aggregate net worth of the richest 7 percent of households increased by 28 percent while that of the lower 93 percent declined by 4 percent. The richest 7 percent thus increased their share of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total wealth from 56 percent to 63 percent. Another study found that between 2010 and 2013 the aggregate net worth of the richest 1 percent of Americans increased by 7.8 percent, representing an increase of 1.4 percent in their share of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total wealth (from 33.9 percent to 35.3 percent).\nAs the financial crisis spread from the United States to other countries, particularly in western Europe (where several major banks had invested heavily in American MBSs), so too did the recession. Most industrialized countries experienced economic slowdowns of varying severity (notable exceptions were China , India , and Indonesia), and many responded with stimulus packages similar to the ARRA. In some countries the recession had serious political repercussions . In Iceland , which was particularly hard-hit by the financial crisis and suffered a severe recession, the government collapsed, and the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three largest banks were nationalized. In Latvia , which, along with the other Baltic countries, was also affected by the financial crisis, the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP shrank by more than 25 percent in 2008\\xe2\\x80\\x9309, and unemployment reached 22 percent during the same period. Meanwhile, Spain , Greece , Ireland , Italy , and Portugal suffered sovereign debt crises that required intervention by the European Union , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and resulted in the imposition of painful austerity measures . In all the countries affected by the Great Recession, recovery was slow and uneven, and the broader social consequences of the downturn\\xe2\\x80\\x94including, in the United States, lower fertility rates , historically high levels of student debt, and diminished job prospects among young adults\\xe2\\x80\\x94were expected to linger for many years.

We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\"".\nWe had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument held water.\nFirst, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion at the debate.\nMost, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Three Pinocchios out of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a 663-page report from 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.).\nThat said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arguments stand out as plausible:.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Bush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back.\nWe found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (The Post \\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.).\n\""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression,\"" and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said.\nSo there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nHowever, the \\xc2\\xa0economists we checked with expressed skepticism -- some strongly so -- about Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion that the recession emerged \""in large part\"" due to tax policies.\nOn the left, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, said he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just call tax cuts a minor factor in causing the recession -- he said he \""can\\'t think of any way they were a factor at all.\"" If anything, he said, \""the conventional wisdom goes the other way -- tax cuts tend to increase the deficit, which pushes up interest rates and in turn drags down house prices.\"".\nOn the right, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. \""Hillary is spouting nonsense,\"" he said. \""No economic theory links tax cuts -- or, for that matter, tax increases -- to financial market meltdowns.\"".\n\""Clinton is on solid ground criticizing Bush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax cuts, but blaming them for the recession goes too far,\"" said Bruce Bartlett, a former Ronald Reagan aide who has sometimes broken with some conservative orthodoxies . \""One can certainly say that the Bush tax cuts failed to raise economic growth or lower unemployment to any significant degree, and one can argue that the Reagan tax cuts were not especially stimulative as well. But to argue that the Bush tax cuts caused the 2008-09 recession is a stretch.\"".\nHarvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who was an official in the administrations of both Bush and his father, said that tax cuts seem like an unlikely culprit, because \""historically we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had relatively low rates without terrible -- or any -- recessions.\"" He added that low tax rates \""would not make my list of the top 10 reasons for the recession.\"".\nInstead, Rosen pointed to a \""housing bubble in the United States and Europe that was fed by excess liquidity and poorly regulated mortgage markets.\"" This became a problem, he said, when large financial institutions that had huge amounts of assets dependent on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed.\n\""After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the financial system collapsed,\"" Rosen said. \""With the collapse in confidence came a collapse in credit markets -- no one was able to borrow -- which ultimately caused a contraction of the real economy.\"".\nBrookings Institution economist Gary Burtless added another factor: the irrational psychologies of the bubble, on the part of both homebuyers and lenders who felt empowered to pursue risky arrangements in the absence of strict regulation. \""By the middle of the 2000-2010 decade, a great many loans were made that prudent lenders would not have made in the 1990s or ever the early 2000s,\"" Burtless said.\nThis, in turn, led to the \""end of a housing boom, a sharp decline in housing prices, widespread mortgage defaults, widespread mortgage securities defaults, and a lack of assets to cover the losses at nine large financial institutions -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, the CitiCorp holding company, and the AIG holding company,\"" said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Stern School of Business.\nClinton said the Great Recession emerged \""in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\"".\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broadly accepted that lack of Wall Street regulation played a role, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arguable that income inequality helped set the conditions. But an ideological cross-section of economists agreed that the recession was primarily caused by a housing bubble that turned into a financial crisis, and that it was caused by many factors more significant than low taxes.\nSo for Clinton to say that tax cuts for the rich \""in large part\"" caused the Great Recession is a significant exaggeration.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \\t .\n \\t \\t \\t A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n Many Americans are feeling, you know, shut out, shut down, the great recession hasn\\'t ended for too many Americans, wages are flat, families are struggling, not enough new jobs, or new businesses are being created, and it\\'s important that we all try to figure out what we\\'re going to do, and that\\'s what I\\'ve done my entire life, fighting for a higher minimum wage, or family leave, now paid family leave which I believe in, equal pay for equal work. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n I believe strongly that we need a finance industry that is good for the economy, and I don\\'t think anybody would argue that during the eight years leading up to the Great Recession, a lot of bets were made [and] risks taken that weren\\'t good for the economy. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n There was no blueprint or how-to manual for fixing a global financial meltdown, an auto crisis, two wars and a great recession, all at the same time. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n Too-easy credit and millions of bad loans made during the U.S. housing bubble paved the way for the financial calamity and Great Recession that followed. Today, by contrast, credit is too tight. Mortgage loans are particularly hard to get, creating a problem for the housing market and the broader economy. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n The Great Recession is not imaginary, and the effects loom large. There was an article in the NYT about the galloping death rate among white men in middle age. Higher than among any other demographic, etc. Mostly death by drugs, alcohol, or suicide. Many of them rural. My feeling is that it\\'s many people who haven\\'t been able to get back into the work force. Reg Morse is an example of the problem. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n Over the last decade, - economists seemed to share a broad consensus about economic policy, with the old splits between monetarists and Keynesians apparently being settled by events. But the Great Recession of the last two years has changed everything. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n Even though the play [ The Best Man] was written a long time ago, the characters seem modern and their struggles to make ends meet and to \""have a little fun along the way\"" have a very contemporary feel. The similarity between the The Great Depression and The Great Recession - as well as the gulf between the super-rich and the ordinary Joe - still rings a bell. One of the things this production accentuates is how beautifully Grandpa and his family accept all kinds of people - rich or poor, black or white - and the best thing that can happen to you is to be part of a loving family. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n Housing was ground zero for the Great Recession. Between early 2006 and Obama\\'s inauguration in 2009, average house prices fell by a third across the country. In certain areas, including cities as diverse as Akron, Orlando and Las Vegas, house prices fell by more than half. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n I think it\\'s been unfortunate, but it\\'s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n There are times when a market such as housing, transportation or the stock or mortgage market keep rising and people with capital want to join in this growth. Soon the markets become overheated, partly because of the abundance of investment money and speculation. This is when the government should raise interest rates and increase the cost of borrowed money. Governments are shy about doing this because it could cause the very recession. Yet this is the best time to do this so that the inevitable recession never reaches the magnitude of the recent Great Recession. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n At the center of every recession is a serious imbalance in the economy and mirrored in the financial system. Think subprime mortgage and the Great Recession, or the technology bubble and the early 2000s recession. There are no such imbalances today. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n The plain fact is that recent college grads aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in massive pain. They suffered during the Great Recession like everyone else, but all told, they probably suffered a little less than most other groups. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\\'re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to America. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n In these times of the \""Great Recession\"", we shouldn\\'t be trying to shift the benefits of wealth behind some curtain. We should be celebrating and encouraging people to make as much money as they can. Profits equal tax money. While some people might find it distasteful to pay taxes, I don\\'t. I find it patriotic. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n The FHA\\'s success provides strong evidence that government can and should play a role in the nation\\'s mortgage finance system. It also demonstrates that although government intervention in the economy during the Great Recession was messy, things would have been a lot messier without it. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n It has become fashionable to rail against government intervention in the economy, and the FHA is a favorite example by those trying to show the government\\'s overreach. In reality, the FHA shows how government action during the Great Recession forestalled a much worse economic fate. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n Before Barack Obama took office, it looked like that pride could have vanished forever, but today, from the staggering depths of the Great Recession, the nation has had 29 straight months of job growth. Workers across my state and across the country are getting back the dignity of a good job and a good salary. \\t \\t\\t \\t .\n The American people understand that it is grotesquely unfair - we are a society that prides itself on fairness, that prides itself on equal opportunity, and people are looking out  ...evidence too long",0

In an interview on NBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Biden said he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advise his family to fly on planes or ride the subway. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go anywhere in confined places right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Biden said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to Mexico, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that you are in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes, it goes everywhere through the aircraft.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nAirlines angrily accused Biden of fearmongering. Media reports noted that Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pessimism contrasted sharply with the reassurances President Barack Obama had given a day earlier, when he said there was no need to panic even as he declared a national health emergency. In a matter of hours, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew were summoned to the White House and assigned to clean up the mess Biden made: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNip it in the bud,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LaHood said, recalling their instructions. .\nThe snafu was the first of many scrambles and setbacks by the Obama administration in its initial response to the swine flu. POLITICO interviewed almost two dozen people, including administration officials, members of Congress and outsiders who contended with the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response, and they described a litany of sadly familiar obstacles: vaccine shortfalls, fights over funding and sometimes contradictory messaging. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is purely a fortuity that this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one of the great mass casualty events in American history,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ron Klain, who was Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief of staff at the time, said of H1N1 in 2019. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck. If anyone thinks that this can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen again, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to go back to 1918, they just have to go back to 2009, 2010 and imagine a virus with a different lethality, and you can just do the math on that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 13: Ebola Response Coordinator Ron Klain (L), joined by U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden (R), speaks during a meeting regarding Ebola at the Eisenhower Executive office building November 13, 2014 in Washington, D.C. Vice President Biden met with leaders of faith, humanitarian, and non-governmental organizations that are responding to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) | Mark Wilson/Getty Images .\nOver the course of a year, the H1N1 flu infected 60 million Americans, but claimed only 12,469 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. .\nKlain now says his comments, which were made at a biosecurity summit, referred solely to the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficulties in producing enough of an H1N1 vaccine to meet public demand. The Obama team, he says, quickly adapted to the situation, making choices that were starkly different from those the Trump administration would make 11 years later, such as quickly distributing emergency equipment from the federal stockpile, deferring to public health experts and having them take the lead on messaging. .\nNow, as Biden prepares to take on President Donald Trump in a presidential election marked by a far more lethal pandemic, Klain and other Biden intimates have seized on the idea that the former vice president is the man for this moment. Having played pivotal roles in the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to H1N1 and Ebola, Biden himself has insisted he is uniquely equipped to confront the coronavirus pandemic. Obama, too, lauded Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contributions. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJoe helped me manage H1N1 and prevent the Ebola epidemic from becoming the type of pandemic we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama said in endorsing Biden. .\nBut an extensive review of the handling of H1N1, including the examination of public records and congressional testimony, suggests the response was not the panacea portrayed by the Biden camp and its defenders: Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role, while significant, was not equivalent to leading the response. He was the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main liaison to governors and Congress and succeeded in securing funding from skeptical leaders. Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt at messaging, via the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interview, proved that he, at least, took the threat of a pandemic very seriously. But by issuing warnings that others in the administration weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prepared to endorse, he contributed to a muddled message. .\nBiden declined to comment, but former officials described a White House, still in its infancy, bogged down by seismic economic challenges and struggling to keep its signature promise for a universal health care plan. With a Health and Human Services Department still bereft of more than a dozen officials \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the Cabinet secretary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Obama team now had a fast-moving pandemic with unknown lethality bearing down on them. .\nAfter an initial run of problems \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including an inability to contain the virus and slower-than-expected development of a vaccine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they say they learned quickly and generated a better response both in the later stages of H1N1 and then, five years later, in confronting the much more lethal Ebola virus. .\nThey listened to the scientists. They got Congress on board. They put experts out in front of the public. And they righted messaging, adopting an acronym that would serve as a linchpin in averting future snafus: PTFOTV \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Put Tony Fauci on TV. A Killer of Children .\nH1N1 entered the U.S. population at the opposite end of the age spectrum as the novel coronavirus: The most vulnerable people were under 30, a realization that would come to worry parents across the country. .\nIn one CDC study, children between the ages of 5 and 14 were found to be 14 times more likely to be infected than those 60 or older. .\nThe first case emerged on April 15, when a 10-year-old in California tested positive for a virus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunknown to humans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to a CDC analysis. Two days later, an 8-year-old in another part of California tested positive for the same virus. The two children had no known contact. .\nWhile the CDC began to assess the significance of this development, Obama was in Mexico making a ritual courtesy call on then-President Felipe Calder\\xc3\\xb3n. Brennan was part of Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entourage. At one point, Obama, Brennan and others in the visiting party went to Mexico City\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famed anthropological museum for a private tour by the director. .\nA week later, the museum director, Felipe Solis, died of flu-like symptoms. While his ailment was initially thought to be H1N1, doctors later surmised that he had suffered from an unrelated form of pneumonia. But the notion that a famous man who had just spent hours with the president might have carried the mystery virus served to underscore its risks. .\nThe CDC quickly began trying to replicate the virus in a way that would lead to a vaccine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a process that was far more advanced for flu than coronaviruses. On April 25, just a few days after Brennan gave his Oval Office briefing to Obama and Biden, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency. A day later, Obama did the same, triggering a release of supplies from the national stockpile, including antiviral drugs, personal protective equipment and respirators. On April 28, two days after Obama declared the emergency, the FDA approved an H1N1 test. .\n FILE - In this April 10, 2014 file photo, then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius listens while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington.

The future of the Affordable Care Act hinges on the outcome of the presidential election, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shaping up as a moment of truth for Republicans. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) | Susan Walsh, File/AP Photo .\nThe 60-year-old Sebelius had won the job after Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first pick, former Sen. Tom Daschle, withdrew from consideration in early February because of tax issues. A former governor of Kansas, Sebelius believed her first challenge would be to dramatically expand health insurance coverage, a task that would require both political armor and acumen. .\nBut after her Senate confirmation, Sebelius was escorted into the White House Situation Room, where Brennan and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel awaited her. They had a more immediate challenge in mind: defeating H1N1. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about health care legislation, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about anything [else],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Emanuel said he told Sebelius. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is target number one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBrennan and Emanuel stressed to Sebelius that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe got to get our hands around\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the severity of the virus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto minimize the public health threat and a potential loss of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to Emanuel. .\nObama and Biden were at a White House news event celebrating the decision by Pennsylvania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republican senator, Arlen Specter, to switch parties. Before joining Biden in heaping praise on Specter, the president turned to the H1N1 issue. .\nObama announced that he had requested $1.5 billion in emergency funding, saying it would \\xe2\\x80\\x9censure that we have adequate supplies of vaccines and the equipment to handle a potential outbreak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had already urged schools to consider closing if they had confirmed or suspected cases of H1N1. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can assure you that we will be vigilant in monitoring the progress of this flu,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I will make every judgment based on the best science available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nObama, seeking to learn from his predecessors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experiences, invited members of the Ford administration to visit the White House and discuss their own fateful dance with the swine flu in 1976, when a variant of H1N1 broke out on a U.S. military base and President Gerald Ford ordered a nationwide vaccination program. .\nInside the Roosevelt Room, a windowless expanse with a large conference table for meetings, F. David Mathews, Ford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health secretary, and William Taft IV, who had served as general counsel for the health department, held forth. Taft, the great-grandson of the 27th president, said he told Obama it was important to get Congress on board early \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand to keep them on board, because that had been very helpful to us in \\xe2\\x80\\x9976.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nMathews offered additional advice: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen people get sick, they want to talk to the doctor. Let the health people take the lead in this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mathews said he told Obama. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou be supportive, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got good doctors, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a good system here, rely on them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nMathews and Taft were so fixated on the new president that they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember whether the new vice president, who was already a familiar Washington hand in the Ford days, attended the meeting. But Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four decades of contacts would prove useful in implementing Taft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice to get Congress on board. .\nObama faced a deceptively difficult struggle with Congress. Few in the House or Senate understood the dangers of pandemics. Democratic leaders, having finished a massive stimulus two months earlier, were setting their sights on priorities like health care reform and reducing carbon emissions. Republicans, meanwhile, were massing in opposition to the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spending plans, feeling bruised by what they saw as Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt to cram unrelated Democratic priorities into the stimulus bill, which was supposed to provide a short-term jolt to the economy. .\nEven after his comments on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d blew up, Biden remained attentive to the H1N1 issue, attending almost all the briefings for Obama and other top officials, Brennan recalled. .\nOne aide involved in the H1N1 response said even if Biden wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t present at meetings, his interests were made known. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was often: \\xe2\\x80\\x98The vice president wants to know X, Y or Z,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the aide said. .\nBut as usual, the affable Biden was most active behind the scenes, serving as Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambassador to political leaders across the country. Governors were particularly apprehensive about H1N1 as they began looking ahead to a new school year a few months hence. Klain recalls that Sebelius would refer local officials who were impatient or frustrated with some aspect of the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to Biden for a pep talk. .\nIndeed, the vice president was on the horn every time a local bigwig needed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspeak to someone important at the White House,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said. Biden was proactive as well, delivering an H1N1 briefing to a conference of governors at which he took questions and offered guidance from the CDC. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was scary, I think a lot of people were apprehensive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, who recalled Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s briefing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was the kind of the guy, you tell him what you need and he was very receptive, personable. He was always available. If you needed something you could always call him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was the kind of the guy, you tell him what you need and he was very receptive, personable. He was always available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nFauci, who had been the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infectious disease chief since the Reagan administration, predicted a dangerous surge in infections once school was back in session, necessitating more money for vaccines, medical supplies and overall preparedness. .\nObama asked Biden, who already served as the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unofficial liaison to the Senate, to meet with congressional leaders to lobby for nearly $9 billion. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuring the meeting, something came up, someone tapped Obama on his shoulder and he had to leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d recalled then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBiden wound up running the meeting and making the case for more money. From that point forward, he basically took over on the swine flu deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBiden laid out the potential dangers ahead, stressing the need to quickly ramp up on vaccine development, according to an aide in the room at the time. Democrats were receptive. Republican opposition had played a role in blocking the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request for pandemic funding in the stimulus bill, before H1N1 even appeared. Now, with children vulnerable to infection, that opposition melted away. .\nEven as federal money was flowing into vaccine development, government scientists were starting to see a problem: The H1N1 virus was taking longer to grow in eggs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the method of producing a mutated version of the virus for a vaccine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 than the seasonal flu. .\nThat meant there would be a lag in preparing the seed stocks of virus that manufacturers needed to start production. But the Obama administration made a significant mistake: Sebelius\\xe2\\x80\\x99 team at HHS nonetheless announced that if all went as planned, they should have 100 million doses ready for use by mid-October. That was consistent with promises made by the vaccine manufacturers, who had actually contracted for 120 million doses by October, but before the delays in the seed stocks. .\nThe slowness in growing the virus needed for the vaccine was compounded by a range of additional setbacks, including repeated glitches in manufacturing the drug. .\nThere were also mistakes in establishing a proper dose, with an initial protocol calling for two rounds of the vaccine. It turned out that was recommended only for children 10 and younger. .\nSebelius declined to comment, but Nicole Lurie, who served as HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said there were two components to the delay: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne was, the vaccine rolled out slowly because of some production issues. Stuff always goes wrong. The other, people wanted it faster than they could get it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIndeed, flu season was approaching, and local officials \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not to mention parents who were sending their children to crowded classrooms \\xe2\\x80\\x94 demanded protection. .\n FILE - In this Nov. 9, 2009, file photo, a package of the H1N1 swine flu vaccine is shown at a pharmacy in Seattle.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, file) | Ted S. Warren, file/AP Photo .\nBy mid-October, however, when the demand for the vaccine was at its highest, supply fell dramatically short, with as few as 11 million doses on hand, according to one report . .\nAt this point, about 22 million Americans had been infected with H1N1, 540 children had died and 36,000 children had been hospitalized, according to CDC estimates at the time . .\nCompounding the supply setbacks was the form of the initial vaccination shipments: Almost all of it was nasal spray, which could not be used by some in the highest-risk groups, like children with asthma and pregnant women. .\nWhen reports circulated of an impending shortage of supply, demand soared. Parents rushed their children to doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offices. Soon, lines for the vaccine stretched for blocks in cities across the country, including Los Angeles and New York. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were long lines,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lurie said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there is a shortage of something, it seems people really want it. Once it was widely available, there was less interest. That was one of those things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nState health officials and doctors grew exasperated as their orders failed to come in on time. California, for instance, reported that by November it had received only half the number of vaccines it had ordered and feared it couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cover even vulnerable populations. .\nPerpetuating the shortages were states like New York, which required all of its health workers to receive the shots. As the supplies lagged, however, New York lifted the requirement. .\nOn Oct. 23, CDC Director Tom Frieden apologized for the snafus: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we have learned more in the last couple of weeks is that not only is the virus unpredictable, but vaccine production is much less predictable than we wish. We are nowhere near where we thought we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be by now. We are not near where the vaccine manufacturers predicted we would be. We share the frustration of people who have waited on line or called a number or checked a website and haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to find a place to get vaccinated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nEventually, the U.S. was swamped with the H1N1 vaccine. But most of it arrived after flu season had peaked and demand had died down. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had great scientists working on the vaccine. We had all kinds of people working on logistics. But in the end, the vaccine did not arrive in time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe vast majority of H1N1 cases we had in America happened before the vaccine was available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTestifying before a congressional panel in November 2009, Fauci acknowledged the administration had created false expectations, but he blamed the surprising slowness of the virus growth. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had great scientists working on the vaccine. We had all kinds of people working on logistics. But in the end, the vaccine did not arrive in time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe drug companies in good faith contracted with the government to get a certain amount of doses for the flu season,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fauci said during a Nov. 4, 2009, congressional hearing at which officials were asked to explain vaccine shortages. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith that comes benchmarks when you think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be delivered. The fact that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not has to do with what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said over and over again \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that the virus doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grow very well. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the nature of the biology of the virus that created an expectation that we thought there would be a certain amount, that expectation was shared with the American public and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disappointment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBy Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second term, the H1N1 crisis was a distant memory. Klain had left the White House in 2011 to take a job at Case Holdings, advising AOL founder Steve Case on his business and charitable interests. But then, in 2014, the specter of a pandemic loomed again. .\nEbola, a deadly virus spread from bats to humans, appeared in West Africa. Far less infectious than H1N1, Ebola was believed to be spread through bodily fluids. It was also, however, far more deadly than H1N1. In the United States, fears grew when a Dallas man who had recently worked in Liberia died of the virus in early October and two nurses who treated him became infected. Obama, already battling low favorability ratings, was facing a firestorm of criticism over his handling of Ebola. .\nAt that point, with most of the infections still in Africa, Obama tapped Klain to become his Ebola czar, managing both the public health response and the diplomatic challenge in making sure foreign governments did enough to contain the virus within their boundaries. .\nShortly after returning to the White House, Klain found himself breaking delicate news to Obama. A doctor named Craig Spencer, who had volunteered to treat Ebola patients in the African nation of Guinea, had tested positive for the disease in New York City. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is going to be the test,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said he told Obama at the time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was going to be a show-me moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe test, in Klain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view, related neither to public health nor diplomacy. Trump, the New York businessman, had emerged as a leading political provocateur, building a following by demanding ever-greater evidence that Obama had been born in Hawaii, not Kenya, as Trump claimed. Now, Ebola was striking Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hometown, and he had a fresh occasion to demand a travel ban on nations where the disease was present. He fanned the flames just as the Obama administration was trying to tamp down panic and reassure the public. .\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand extended to doctors and medical workers: If they chose to go to those countries to treat patients, he argued, they shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to return. .\n President Donald Trump speaks at Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Tuesday, June 11, 2019. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo .\nOn Aug. 1, he tweeted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The next day, he wrote: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our \\xe2\\x80\\x98borders.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Act fast!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And on Aug. 8, he tweeted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSame CDC which is bringing Ebola to US misplaced samples of anthrax earlier this year\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Be careful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nFor months, in the run-up to the 2014 midterms, Trump didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let up. In October, he went after Obama personally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mental health. Why won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he stop the flights. Psycho!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nKlain recalls that Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attacks were effective: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of the fears that gripped this country, specifically in October and November in 2014, were stirred up by Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweets. If we were able to successfully isolate and treat Dr. Spencer and no one got sick in that process, and the disease did not transmit in New York, this, more than anything else, would put an end to the Trump messaging on it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTo keep Ebola from spreading further beyond Africa, the administration, which already had dispatched 3,000 troops to West Africa to help contain the spread, had to send public health workers to the affected countries via commercial airlines. This would not be dangerous unless a person was exposed to the blood or other bodily fluids of an Ebola victim. But pilots, passengers, airport workers and others in American cities from which the workers came and went had to be put at ease about the possible spread of the contagion. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone in my office knew what PTFOTV stood for: Put Tony Fauci on TV,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe just had someone the president and vice president trusted deeply, we knew he was a communicator that the American people trusted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nFauci was dispatched to cable news shows. Employing another lesson of the H1N1 days, Klain recruited the CDC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Frieden to join him in briefings to add medical credibility to the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions. .\n National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci attends a meeting with President Donald Trump and pharmaceutical executives on the coronavirus in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Monday, March 2, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo .\nBiden, Klain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mentor, played an even larger role in Ebola than in H1N1, using his personal persuasion to reassure pilots and airline workers, Klain recalls. Biden also worked with governors in five states where airports were regularly used to transport U.S. personnel and equipment to Ebola-stricken countries. .\nOnce again, Biden served as a conduit to Congress, helping push through $5.4 billion in emergency funds. This was a tougher task than during H1N1. The House was under Republican control, and much of the Ebola money was heading overseas, to help contain the virus in Africa. .\nLisa Monaco, who served as Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, remembered a notable exchange between Biden and then-Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan when the African leader visited the White House during the Ebola outbreak. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe vice president was quite forceful with him to accelerate [his] response,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Monaco said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe message was: \\xe2\\x80\\x98We need you and your government to really step up and do more on detection, surveillance and tracing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nEventually, Dr. Spencer recovered and Ebola did not spread further in the United States. Medical volunteers who had been infected in Africa were allowed back in, and safely treated in U.S. hospitals without further spread. Klain and the rest of the Obama team considered the containment of Ebola to be a sharp rebuke to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas. .\nAs he faces daily criticism of his response to the coronavirus \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the most severe pandemic in a century \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump has tried to turn the spotlight on the Obama-Biden administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handling of the swine flu. .\nOn March 12, when there were only about 40 recorded coronavirus deaths in the United States, Trump tweeted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nFact-checkers disputed Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions , noting that the two polls measuring public approval of the Obama team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to H1N1 had averaged a fairly robust 67 percent. .\nBut the day after his initial tweet, Trump amplified the claims, stating again on Twitter: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTheir response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nSeven weeks later, Trump continues to face criticism for unkept promises about the level of testing and his overly optimistic projections about the rate of infections and deaths, while Democrats claim Obama and Biden were quicker to grasp the seriousness of the pandemic and mobilize the national stockpile and widespread testing. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat really happened was that in the end in the course of a year 14,000 Americans died from H1N1, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing every week from Covid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe did prepare for H1N1, we did execute a response from H1N1. That response included much more rapid testing than what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing with Covid and a much more accelerated, professional and medical-based response.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nDespite Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions, few close observers of Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to H1N1 consider it a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull scale disaster.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Biden, despite his early messaging problems, played a role in mobilizing the administration and ensuring enough resources were devoted to defeating the pandemic. .\nBut the difficulties in mounting an effective response to H1N1, most officials agree, still stand as a cautionary tale for future administrations: Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, should he ever confront such a situation again. .\n White House Centers For Disease Control Ebola Barack Obama Joe Biden Joe Biden 2020 H1N1 Obama Administration Donald Trump Donald Trump 2020 Ron Klain Anthony Fauci Vaccination Coronavirus Pandemic .\n About Us Advertising Breaking News Alerts Careers Credit Card Payments Digital Edition FAQ Feedback Headlines Photos POWERJobs Press Print Subscriptions Request A Correction Write For Us RSS Site Map Terms of Service Privacy Policy Do not sell my info Notice to California Residents."", ""ev ...evidence too long",0

Jon Tester \""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.\"" .\nWhile declaring his U.S. Senate bid, Republican hopeful Matt Rosendale zeroed in on the Second Amendment record of his opponent Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.\n\""Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government,\"" Rosendale, Montana\\'s state auditor,\\xc2\\xa0said in a July 31 interview on Voices of Montana.\nThis point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry.\n\""When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned,\"" said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who has authored several books on gun control.\nAn important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers.\nWhile some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inconsistent with common parlance.\nFurther, Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to \""the people of Montana,\"" and Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry.\nWe asked Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Tester cast in favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate.\nFor the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories.\nThe Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list to those on the U.S. government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consolidated terror watchlist of known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe Rosendale campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry.\nExperts dismissed the notion that to deny gun\\xc2\\xa0sales to the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list of known and suspected terrorists, flawed as it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners.\n\""The terror watch list is not a gun registry,\"" said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. \""In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!\"".\nDavid Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t add up.\n\""This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,\"" Hemenway said. \""He doesn\\'t seem to understand what a registry is.\"".\nSo Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central claim is flat wrong \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to \""ask permission from the federal government\"" before they purchase a gun.\nBecause the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absurdity.\nThe Rosendale campaign said further that Tester\\xe2\\x80\\x99s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However \\xe2\\x80\\x94 leaving aside whether these bills would have done that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the reality is that Tester\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries.\nTester voted for the 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, which we previously found would have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry.\nIn 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers who pushed for a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, and voted in favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as 2006 that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry).\nHe\\xc2\\xa0also co-signed a 2011 letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an \""international gun registry.\"" For this, Tester earned praise from the National Rifle Association for \""stand(ing) on the side of America\\'s 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms.\"".\nRosendale said Tester \""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.\"".\nSays Sen.

Jon Tester \""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.\"" .\nWhile declaring his U.S. Senate bid, Republican hopeful Matt Rosendale zeroed in on the Second Amendment record of his opponent Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.\n\""Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government,\"" Rosendale, Montana\\'s state auditor,\\xc2\\xa0said in a July 31 interview on Voices of Montana.\nThis point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry.\n\""When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned,\"" said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who has authored several books on gun control.\nAn important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers.\nWhile some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inconsistent with common parlance.\nFurther, Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to \""the people of Montana,\"" and Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry.\nWe asked Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Tester cast in favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate.\nFor the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories.\nThe Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list to those on the U.S. government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consolidated terror watchlist of known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe Rosendale campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry.\nExperts dismissed the notion that to deny gun\\xc2\\xa0sales to the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list of known and suspected terrorists, flawed as it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners.\n\""The terror watch list is not a gun registry,\"" said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. \""In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!\"".\nDavid Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t add up.\n\""This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,\"" Hemenway said. \""He doesn\\'t seem to understand what a registry is.\"".\nSo Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central claim is flat wrong \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to \""ask permission from the federal government\"" before they purchase a gun.\nBecause the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absurdity.\nThe Rosendale campaign said further that Tester\\xe2\\x80\\x99s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However \\xe2\\x80\\x94 leaving aside whether these bills would have done that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the reality is that Tester\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries.\nTester voted for the 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, which we previously found would have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry.\nIn 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers who pushed for a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, and voted in favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as 2006 that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry).\nHe\\xc2\\xa0also co-signed a 2011 letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an \""international gun registry.\"" For this, Tester earned praise from the National Rifle Association for \""stand(ing) on the side of America\\'s 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms.\"".\nRosendale said Tester \""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.\"".\nSays Sen. Jon Tester \""believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government.\"".\nNational Rifle Association press release, \"" U.S. Senate Stands with NRA in Strongly Opposing U.N Gun Control Efforts ,\"" July 22, 2011.\nEmail interview with Philip J.

He is \u2014 by any reasonable legal understanding of the term \u2014 the \u201capparent\u201d winner. Why, then, is the Trump administration able to stall the transition process to new leadership?.\nThe answer is simple: the law is too vague. It doesn\u2019t place a timeline on when a sitting president\u2019s administration must start helping a successor regime to take over. As a result, Trump appointees are able to drag their feet, making it far more difficult for President-elect Joe Biden and his team to prepare to lead the country.\nCongress has been abundantly clear about the importance of an orderly transfer of presidential power.\u00a0In the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 , Congress declared that\u00a0\u201cany disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States and its people.\u201d.\nThe process is triggered when the head of the General Services Administration (GSA) \u2014 the government agency that facilitates the presidential transfer of power \u2014 ascertains the\u00a0\u201capparent\u201d winner following the general presidential election. The problem is that the law doesn\u2019t specify\u00a0how\u00a0or\u00a0when\u00a0GSA must make that determination and carry out its important responsibilities to assist the incoming administration. The delay and problems of the transition.\nFor example, state election results are\u00a0\u201cofficial\u201d only after they are certified by the states , and the deadline for certification is not until Dec.\u00a08, which leaves a very narrow period for an effective transition. Given the massive size and scope of the U.S. government, every day is critical.\nTo compound the problem, the law is silent on how GSA should\u00a0ascertaining\u00a0the apparent winner. Can the agency make its call any time before certification by the states on Dec.\u00a08, as it often has?\u00a0Or does it need to wait for, say 80%, 90%, or all of the votes to be counted?.\nThe legislation gives no guidance.\u00a0And because the GSA lacks an official policy, we are left to rely on the goodwill of the agency\u2019s leaders to kickstart a crucial Constitutional process.\nHistorically, the transition process commences when one candidate concedes , and the norm has generally been that gracious and patriotic losers concede when their teams are convinced that the election results leave no credible path to victory, thereby putting aside their political fury for the good of the country.\nBut Trump has flouted that tradition and the ethical norms of our republic, and now his appointees are standing in the way of a smooth transfer of power.\nThis isn\u2019t the only time the law\u2019s murkiness has been problematic. Following the disputed 2000 election, the GSA similarly refused to commence the transition process, in light of the Florida recount. At the time, then-GSA administrator\u00a0David Barram\u00a0offered conflicting justifications to an angry Congressional oversight panel, including his view that \u201cin this unprecedented, incredibly close, and intensely contested election, with legal action being pursued by both sides, it is not apparent to me who the winner is.\u201d.\nThis left the incoming Bush team too little time to prepare to lead the country , something that was later cited as a contributing factor in the government\u2019s failure to prevent the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Three ways to fix the transition problem.\nThe problems we faced in 2000 have resurfaced in 2020, but they can be resolved by amending the act in three ways.\nFirst, it is ridiculous that the act gives power to determine the\u00a0\u201capparent winner\u201d to a political appointee of the current administration, who has an obvious conflict of interest, pitting the incentive to protect the president\u2019s longevity against his or her duty to the American people. Congress should amend the act to create a nonpartisan commission to make the determination, as law professor Todd Zywicki urged almost\u00a020 years ago.\nSecond,\u00a0Congress should require the commission to make its decision\u00a0at the earliest reasonable time, including before official state certification when possible. In a landslide election, there is no reason to delay the process until certification by the states. In a close election, it might need to wait.\u00a0But, given the clear policy and legislative directive of the act, the transition determination should happen as soon as the nonpartisan commission has identified whether objective criteria for determining the apparent winner have been met.\nThird, whatever other factors the commission considers, including whether one side has conceded, at some point the math should be dispositive: the commission should be required to declare the likely winner \u2014 and then start the transition procedures \u2014 when the average state election count is 90% complete and one candidate is above the 270 electoral vote threshold.\nCalls for reform are not new.

Weiner. .\nSince he was declared the winner of the 2020 election on Saturday, President-Elect Joe Biden and his team have started an informal transition planning process, which so far has included naming key staff members, outlining a policy agenda, and forming a Covid-19 advisory board. President Donald Trump, however, has refused to concede and attempted to cast doubt on the validity of the election, claiming without evidence that there was widespread voter fraud\u00a0and other irregularities. His campaign has filed numerous meritless lawsuits to challenge the election results. .\nMeanwhile, many Republican leaders in Congress and in the administration have yet to acknowledge the outcome of the election. In remarks on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went as far to suggest that \u201cthere will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.\u201d (He later claimed to be joking.) And Emily W. Murphy, the Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration, has refused to formally recognize Biden as the election winner, delaying the start of the official presidential transition process. .\nTo place these developments into context, the Brennan Center\u2019s Daniel I. Weiner spoke with Tim Lau and explained\u00a0the significance of a peaceful transfer of power, the consequences of inadequate presidential transitions, and the potential for reform. .\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length. What is the significance of a peaceful transfer of power in a democracy like the United States? .\nA peaceful transfer of power \u2014 particularly from one political party to another \u2014 is, in my mind, the ultimate expression of the rule of law and of a society governed by the law, not by individual rulers. Say other things that you want about him, but it was George Washington\u2019s great contribution to the American political tradition when he voluntarily gave up the presidency. It established an unbroken tradition of presidents yielding power, including to their bitter political opponents. Even on the cusp of the Civil War, for example, James Buchanan never suggested that Abraham Lincoln wasn\u2019t entitled to become president after he won the election. That\u2019s what\u2019s so unprecedented with the current transition process, right? There is no legal path for Donald Trump to remain president. None. The spectacle of an incumbent president behaving this way is something we haven\u2019t seen before and is deeply corrosive to our democracy. Who are the key players and institutions in the presidential transition, and why is it important that it\u2019s a nonpartisan process? .\nThe presidential transition process exists both on a symbolic level and on a practical level. On the symbolic level, it has tremendous significance. The ritual of one president preparing to cede power to another signifies that we are a law-abiding society in which the will of the voters governs. .\nBut there is also a practical level. The federal government of the United States is one of the largest organizations in the world, and the process of transferring control from one group of political actors to another is incredibly complex. There are thousands of real-time decisions that will have to be made from the moment the next president takes office. There are organizational competencies that have to be developed. So, we\u2019ve developed this long-standing tradition where as soon as the result of the election becomes apparent, the incumbent administration \u2014 if the administration is changing \u2014 undertakes to help the incoming administration take up the reins. .\nI think what the rest of the world sees is the symbolic significance, and that\u2019s very important for America\u2019s credibility in the world and also for the confidence the American people have in their government (which is why Pompeo\u2019s joking is absolutely inexcusable). But in addition, the next president has to be ready to govern on day one. And if there isn\u2019t an adequate transition, that puts national security at risk, that puts American lives at risk \u2014 particularly given that the next president is going to have to wrestle with a global pandemic. And it just generally is terrible for government operations. As President George W. Bush\u2019s first chief of staff recently noted , the 9/11 Commission found that the truncated transition for the Bush administration from the Clinton administration was a contributing factor to our vulnerability to the terrorist attacks. We\u2019re playing with fire when we have the same thing happening here. What elements of the presidential transition process, if any, are actually enshrined in the Constitution or in federal law? .\nAs with so many core aspects of our government, the Constitution says almost nothing about presidential transitions, other than that the next president is going to take office on January 20. .\nThe main federal statute, the Presidential Transition Act , was originally passed in 1963. It sets forth certain processes and requirements that govern both before and \u2014 if a new president is coming to power \u2014 after the election. The overall process is managed by the General Services Administration (GSA). For present purposes, the most important provision is the one that appears to leave it to the GSA administrator to \u201cascertain\u201d whether a new president and vice president have been elected, which is the key to unlocking resources and access to federal agencies, including the all-important national security briefings. Since the administrator was appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the incumbent president, there is an obvious conflict of interest. Again, though, until now no GSA administrator has ever tried to delay a transition in the wake of an election whose result was clear. .\nThat\u2019s basically it. There\u2019s nothing that says the incumbent president must invite their successor to the White House or personally cooperate with them in any way. It\u2019s all just tradition \u2014 but again, tradition that no outgoing administration has ever flouted to the extent we are seeing now. Let\u2019s discuss the current situation. Almost two weeks after the election, the president has not yet acknowledged the outcome. Neither have key senior officials like the vice president or the secretary of state. What kind of signal does that send to Americans and to the world? .\nAgain, I really want to emphasize that these tactics aren\u2019t going to be successful. They are not going to keep Joe Biden from becoming the next president. According to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency \u2014 which is part of the Trump administration \u2014 this election \u201c was the most secure in American history .\u201d The result is crystal clear. .\nBut I think they are enormously corrosive to the foundation of our society. The damage to our standing in the world and to the confidence Americans can have in their government could be substantial. .\nIn this regard, I really do want to focus on Secretary Pompeo. Recall that he already has violated a long-standing tradition of secretaries of state staying out of politics by, for instance, speaking at the Republican convention. His statement about a Trump second term \u2014 regardless of its intent \u2014 really does put him on par with, say, the foreign minister of Belarus (a country whose leader Pompeo himself has criticized for trying to cling to power by antidemocratic means). He\u2019s behaving like a regime thug, and that has done tremendous damage to the office of the secretary of state. It won\u2019t change the result, but it\u2019s still shameful. .\nI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t also mention Attorney General Barr. He made some outrageous statements prior to the election that seemed to indicate a willingness to interfere with voting (which would have been illegal ). On Monday he issued a memo authorizing Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors to investigate unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud before the results of the election are certified, which is a radical break from precedent. .\nThis is almost certainly just posturing, as Brennan Center Vice President for Democracy Wendy Weiser recently explained . Without any evidence of widespread misconduct (which does not exist), there isn\u2019t much DOJ can do. But the fact remains that Barr has presided over a level of politicization at DOJ that we simply haven\u2019t seen in the modern era. It makes the Bush-era U.S. attorney firing scandal , which brought down a sitting attorney general and ruined his reputation, look positively tame. What\u2019s happening with the transition didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. We\u2019ve seen a consistent effort to undermine the legitimacy of our elections. .\nIn some ways, this is the culmination of something that\u2019s been going on for the better part of a year, which is a sustained effort to cast doubt on the legitimacy of our elections, really as a tactic for voter suppression and ultimately to try to make certain people\u2019s votes not count as much as other people\u2019s votes. And you see it\u2019s inevitably the votes coming from predominantly Black and brown communities, urban communities, that are somehow \u201csuspect.\u201d That\u2019s been happening since long before the election. It happened with the president\u2019s threats to deploy troops to the polls (validated by Barr) and to encourage vigilantes to go to the polls to \u201cwatch\u201d election workers and voters. He\u2019s tried to sow distrust in our system. .\nI think that there\u2019s a really big difference between wanting our democracy to work, but acknowledging very serious problems, and just a wholesale effort to undermine people\u2019s basic faith in the democratic process. The reality is that this election was an enormous logistical achievement. It actually ran very smoothly, all things considered. And that\u2019s due in large part to the tireless work of election officials, both Republican and Democratic. There\u2019s no basis in reality to cast serious doubt on the outcome. But Trump\u2019s team has been telegraphing that they would do exactly that for months if they lost, and now we are seeing it. .\nAt the end of the day, though, the result just wasn\u2019t that close. Biden is currently ahead in Pennsylvania by almost 60,000 votes (and of course his national lead is more than 5 million). At this point, as the very conservative editorial board of the very conservative Las Vegas Review Journal recently pointed out , Trump is doing his own supporters a disservice by refusing to accept the inevitable. What can be done to help ensure an accountable, transparent, and smooth transition process in the future? .\nYou might start by placing more of a clear-cut obligation on incumbent administrations to provide information and otherwise cooperate with incoming administrations by a certain date, instead of vague statutory language that appears to leave it up to this one agency official \u2014 though I should note that the Biden transition team has said it is considering litigation, and they probably have pretty decent arguments that the statue, as it exists, doesn\u2019t give the administrator of the GSA carte blanche to just ignore the result of an election. But clearer baseline rules would help. .\nCongress could theoretically say: Look, within two or three days of the election, every candidate who plausibly could become president gets access to the information and the facilities necessary to accomplish a transition. Again, none of these problems are completely new, right? During Bush v. Gore , the Clinton administration just decided to not give either the George W. Bush team or the Al Gore team access. And they waited until the final resolution of that dispute. But again, that led to a truncated transition that may have negatively impacted our national security. .\nBeyond the narrow issue of presidential transitions, what is transpiring during the lame-duck period is just further proof that we need to codify some of the unwritten rules that the Trump administration has discarded, along the lines recommended by the Brennan Center\u2019s bipartisan task force . We need limits on White House interference with law enforcement, stronger implementation of ethics rules, better personnel practices, and much more. And of course we also need to repair many of the very real problems with our democracy that have helped to undermine confidence, which we can do by passing reforms like those in the landmark For the People Act , also known as H.R. 1. These have got to be priorities for the next president and Congress, and I think they will be. We have a lot of work to do. .\n Main navigation Issues Ensure Every American Can Vote Defend Our Elections Gerrymandering & Fair Representation Reform Money in Politics Strengthen Our Courts End Mass Incarceration Protect Liberty & Security Bolster Checks & Balances Advance Constitutional Change Our Work News & Analysis Research & Reports Policy Solutions Court Cases Experts Get Involved Support Our Work Get Informed Attend an Event Partner With Us About Mission & Impact History Programs Employment Staff Board of Directors Leadership Financial & Legal Information Contact Us Brennan Center & NYU School of Law ."", ""evidence"": ""A peaceful transfer of power \u2014 particularly from one political party to another \u2014 is the ultimate expression of the rule of law, says the Brennan Center\u2019s Daniel I.

Although a President-Elect does not have constitutional power, Congress often treats the President-Elect as if he does. For instance, Congress frequently holds confirmation hearings for nominees before the inauguration of the President-Elect. Presidential transition teams also often work with the Office of Management and Budget to help plan the executive budget before the new administration takes office. Furthermore, presidential transition team members receive security clearances, classified information, and access to government offices and staff.\nZoffer maintains that presidential transition teams wield quasi-executive powers. During the transition process, the President-Elect nominates key government officials, begins to fill the approximately 4,100 presidentially appointed positions, sets expectations for administrative agencies, creates policy plans, develops priorities for the first 100 days in office, and even drafts executive orders.\nYet presidential transition teams are governed by few laws when compared to sitting Presidents, explains Zoffer. The main laws governing transition teams are the Presidential Transition Act, the Logan Act, nonprofit law, and voluntary ethics codes.\nThe Presidential Transition Act of 1963 , and its subsequent amendments, promote a smooth transition process by providing access to office space and funding. This law also requires disclosure of financial contributions and names of transition personnel and limits contributions by private persons and organizations. Furthermore, it requires the outgoing administration to create a coordinating council, negotiate a memorandum of understanding to govern the transition process, and create an ethics plan to mitigate conflicts of interests.\nThe Logan Act makes it a criminal offense for private citizens, such as the President-Elect and his team, to engage in foreign policymaking. Zoffer notes , however, that incoming Presidents have a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clong history of bucking the U.S. Constitution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and engaging in foreign policymaking. For instance, within only five hours of his election, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmessage of friendship\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to France and later in his transition took a trip to meet with the South Korean President. Zoffer maintains that there is a thin legal line between creating a relationship and influencing foreign policy within this context.\nPresidential transition teams are nonprofit organizations, and thus they are governed by nonprofit law. As a result, Zoffer explains , the transition team cannot engage in political campaigning and must seek to promote an element of social welfare.\nLastly, presidential transition teams often adopt their own voluntary codes of ethics. The Obama-Biden transition team, for instance, required staff members to recuse themselves from working on issues they had a financial interest in, to refuse bribes, and to not use information learned during the transition process for private gain. Zoffer emphasizes , however, that these ethics codes lack legally enforceable sanctions.\nIn contrast, sitting presidential administrations are governed by many constitutional and statutory rules. For instance, Presidents are subject to the U.S. Constitution, the Ethics in Government Act (which criminalizes bribery and other financial conflicts of interest), and rigorous record keeping and transparency laws , among others.\nZoffer argues that this disparity in legal guidelines and accountability mechanisms between outgoing and incoming administrations is problematic because the stakes of the presidential transition process are often just as high as the stakes of the actual presidency. Zoffer contends that presidential transition teams face the same ethical quandaries that current administrations face\\xe2\\x80\\x94conflicts of interests, bribes, and self-dealing that can be brought into the White House or used to undermine the outgoing administration.\nBecause of the potential for corrupt dealings, many of the same laws governing current administrations should also govern presidential transitions, Zoffer argues . He proposes that Congress enact several statutory remedies to ensure the fair transfer of power.\nFor example, Congress should provide full funding for presidential transitions, eliminating and banning the use of private funding. Ensuring that presidential transition teams are publicly funded would reduce the risk that private parties can influence the incoming administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy decisions, Zoffer claims.\nFurthermore, he urges Congress to extend federal ethics rules to  ...evidence too long",0

But the foundation reported the Saudi money in December 2008 , and the amount hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t changed since. Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department.\nThe foundation has also taken between $1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The Wall Street Journal reported, several of these donations came in 2014 , after Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure at the State Department.\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fact-checked a similar claim before when Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSaudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Every country except Yemen has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money.

Women need a male guardian to approve a marriage contract, and one law specifies that a wife must obey her husband.\nAnd in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that while there is a nondiscrimination law, women still face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce.\nAccording to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, all sex outside of marriage, including same-sex intercourse, in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death.\nAs for Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that these countries are throwing gay people \\xe2\\x80\\x9coff of buildings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he may be referring to the Islamic State.

Saudi officials deny any links to terrorism groups, but critics point to Saudi charities that fund organizations suspected of ties to militant cells.\nBrian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the Clintons and the foundation had always been careful about donors. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe policies that governed the foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities during Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure as secretary of state already went far beyond legal requirements,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in a statement, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand yet the foundation submitted to even more rigorous standards when Clinton declared her candidacy for president, and is pledging to go even further if she wins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nMrs. Clinton, at a news conference in 2015, joined the foundation when she left the state department and stepped down in 2015 before beginning her campaign.

Trump, could face his own complications if he becomes president, with investments abroad and hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate debt \\xe2\\x80\\x94 financial positions that could be affected by moves he makes in the White House. And on Friday, Paul Manafort resigned as chairman of the Trump campaign, in part because of reports about his lucrative consulting work on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians.\nPolitics Across the United States Expanding Medicaid: North Carolina became the 40th state to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act , the latest sign of how Republican opposition to the health measure has weakened. Forgoing Funds: Mississippi is one of 10 states, all with G.O.P.-led legislatures, that\\xc2\\xa0continue to reject federal funding to expand \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bMedicaid, a political choice that is intensifying financial pressure on hospitals . A.I. on the Campaign Trail: The swift advance of artificial intelligence in politics is already blurring the boundaries between fact and fake \\xc2\\xa0in the 2024 presidential race. Judicial Elections: A costly race for a swing seat on Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Supreme Court \\xe2\\x80\\x94 officially nonpartisan but positively awash in partisanship \\xe2\\x80\\x94 offers a preview of what might be to come for judicial politics .\nStill, Mr. Trump has seized on emails released over the past several weeks from Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure as secretary of state, in which a handful of donors are mentioned. He has attacked her over an email chain that showed Douglas J. Band, an adviser to Mr. Clinton, seeking to arrange a meeting between a senior American government official and Gilbert Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian real estate developer who donated between $1 million and $5 million. Mr. Chagoury explained through a spokesman that he had simply wanted to provide insights on elections in Lebanon.\nSome emails and other records described donors seeking and in some cases obtaining meetings with State Department officials. None showed Mrs. Clinton making decisions in favor of any contributors, but her allies fear that additional emails might come out and provide more fodder for Mr. Trump.\nCraig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, said the decision to forgo corporate and foreign money had nothing to do with the emails. The foundation will continue to raise money from American individuals and charities.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only factor is that we remove the perception problems, if she wins the presidency,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand make sure that programs can continue in some form for people who are being helped.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBut Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch , a conservative group that has sued to obtain records from Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time at the State Department, said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe damage is done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe conflicts of interest are cast in stone, and it is something that the Clinton administration is going to have to grapple with,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Fitton said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will cast a shadow over their policies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAnd in an election year in which a majority of Americans say they do not trust Mrs. Clinton, even some allies questioned why the foundation had not reined in foreign donations sooner, or ended them immediately.\nA Bloomberg poll in June showed that 72 percent of voters said it bothered them either a lot or a little that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. In a CNN/ORC International Poll the same month, 38 percent of voters said Mr. Clinton should completely step down from the foundation, while 60 percent said he should be able to continue working with the foundation if his wife became president. Mr. Clinton said Thursday he would leave the foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s board if Mrs. Clinton won.\nEdward G. Rendell, a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, said the foundation should be disbanded if Mrs. Clinton wins, and he added that it would make sense for the charity to stop taking foreign donations immediately.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do the right thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Rendell said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand the right thing here is, without question, that the first gentleman have nothing to do with raising money for the foundation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nMr. Minassian said ending foreign fund-raising before other sources of money could be found, and without knowing who will win the election, could needlessly gut programs that help provide, for instance, H.I.V. medication to children in Africa.\nBegun in 1997, the foundation has raised roughly $2 billion and is overseen by a board that includes Mr. Clinton and the couple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, Chelsea. Mrs. Clinton joined when she left the State Department and stepped down in 2015 before beginning her campaign. Its work covers 180 countries, helping fund more than 3,500 projects.\nHaving a former president at the helm proved particularly productive, with foreign leaders and business people opening their doors \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and their wallets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to the preternaturally sociable Mr. Clinton.\nAmong the charity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accomplishments: Its Clinton Health Access Initiative \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which is run by Ira C. Magaziner, who was a White House aide involved in Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failed effort to overhaul the health care system in her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first term \\xe2\\x80\\x94 renegotiated the cost of H.I.V. drugs to make them accessible to 11.5 million people. The foundation helped bring healthier meals to more than 31,000 schools in the United States, and it has helped 105,000 farmers in East Africa increase their yields, according to the foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tally.\nIn December 2008, shortly before Mrs. Clinton became secretary of state, Mr. Clinton released a list of more than 200,000 donors to defuse speculation about conflicts.\nSoon after, Mrs. Clinton agreed to keep foundation matters separate from official business , including a pledge to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect upon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the foundation without a waiver. The Obama White House had particularly disliked the gatherings of world leaders, academics and business people, called the Clinton Global Initiative, that the foundation was holding overseas. The foundation limited the conferences to domestic locations while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. On Thursday, Mr. Clinton said the gathering in September in New York would be the foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last.\nVictor Pinchuk , a steel magnate whose father-in-law, Leonid Kuchma, was president of Ukraine from 1994 to 2005, has directed between $10 million and $25 million to the foundation. He has lent his private plane to the Clintons and traveled to Los Angeles in 2011 to attend Mr. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s star-studded 65th birthday celebration.\nBetween September 2011 and November 2012, Douglas E. Schoen, a former political consultant for Mr. Clinton, arranged about a dozen meetings with State Department officials on behalf of or with Mr. Pinchuk to discuss the continuing political crisis in Ukraine, according to reports Mr. Schoen filed as a registered lobbyist.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI had breakfast with Pinchuk. He will see you at the Brookings lunch,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Melanne Verveer, a Ukrainian-American then working for the State Department, wrote in a June 2012 email to Mrs. Clinton.\nA previously undisclosed email obtained by Citizens United, the conservative advocacy group, through public records lawsuits shows the name of Mr. Pinchuk, described as one of Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmost successful businessmen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d among those on an eight-page list of influential people invited to a dinner party at the Clintons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 home.\nEarlier in 2012, Ambassador John F. Tefft wrote to Mrs. Clinton about a visit to Ukraine by Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat the invitation of oligarch, Victor Pinchuk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Clinton replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you know, hearing nice things about your children is as good as it gets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nIn July 2013, the Commerce Department began investigating complaints that Ukraine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and by extension Mr. Pinchuk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company, Interpipe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and eight other countries had illegally dumped a type of steel tube on the American market at artificially low prices.\nA representative for Mr. Pinchuk said the investigation had nothing to do with the State Department, had started after Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tenure and been suspended in July 2014. He added that at least 100 other people had attended the dinner party at Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house and that she and Mr. Pinchuk had spoken briefly about democracy in Ukraine.\nA deal involving the sale of American uranium holdings to a Russian state-owned enterprise was another example of the foundation intersecting with Mrs. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s official role in the Obama administration. Her State Department was among the agencies that signed off on the deal, which involved major Clinton charitable backers from Canada.\nThere was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had exerted influence over the deal, but the timing of the transaction and the donations raised questions about whether the donors had received favorable handling.\nEven if Mr. Clinton steps down, there could be remaining complications about a potential president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name being affixed to an international foundation. And Chelsea Clinton, who is its vice chairwoman, would continue her leadership role.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very difficult to see how the organization called the Clinton Foundation can continue to exist during a Clinton presidency without that posing all sorts of consequences,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John Wonderlich, the interim executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group in Washington. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat they announced only addresses the most egregious potential conflicts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nConsidering the scale and scope of the foundation, Mr. Wonderlich said it was easy to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cname a hundred different types of conflicts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d."", ""evidence"": ""For years the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation thrived largely on the generosity of foreign donors and individuals who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the global charity."", ""nli_class"": ""neutral"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9995794""}, {""snippet"": ""But the posts misrepresent a chart from 2015, which ranks individual contributions to the foundation based on nationality. <b>As FactCheck.org reported in 2019, the Clinton Foundation hasn\\'t received donations from the Ukrainian government.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/02/28/fact-check-clinton-foundation-donors-dont-include-ukraine-government/6943593001/"", ""title"": ""Fact check: Clinton Foundation donors don\\'t include Ukraine government"", ""full_text"": ""Pets Food Reviewed Coupons Blueprint Best Auto Insurance Best Pet Insurance Best Travel Insurance Best Credit Cards Best CD Rates Best Personal Loans.\nWhile unrelated footage purporting to show the Russian invasion of Ukraine runs rampant online , some social media users have resurfaced an old narrative about foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation.\nSimilar rumors about Ukrainian financial donations to the Clinton Foundation have\\xc2\\xa0gained traction on Twitter .

Todd Heisler/The New York Time.\nWASHINGTON \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic Party have agreed to pay $113,000 in fines to settle a Federal Election Commission investigation into whether they violated a campaign finance disclosure law when they funded an opposition research effort into Donald J. Trump and Russia that resulted in a discredited document known as the Steele dossier.\nDuring the 2016 race, the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee retained a law firm, Perkins Coie, which in turn hired a research group, Fusion GPS, that commissioned what became the dossier. In campaign spending disclosures, the campaign and the party said their payments to Perkins Coie were for legal services, not opposition research.\nDan Backer, a conservative lawyer, filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on behalf of a group he leads, the Coolidge Reagan Foundation. It accused the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party of illegally hiding that they had been funding an opposition research effort.\nThe commission has not yet made public the findings of its investigation. But the agency sent a letter about the inquiry and its resolution to Mr. Backer on Tuesday, which he posted on his group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website . The letter said the commission agreed that the campaign and the party had probably violated campaign finance law.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thrilled to have caused some modicum of accountability against Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Backer said, arguing that the dossier had damaged American democracy. He added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not enough and it should be more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nGraham Wilson, a lawyer representing both the campaign and the party in the matter, did not respond to a request for comment. But Daniel Wessel, a Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a statement, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe settled aging and silly complaints from the 2016 election about \\xe2\\x80\\x98purpose descriptions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in our F.E.C. report.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nSo-called conciliation agreements attached to the letter sent to Mr. Backer showed that the campaign and the party disagreed that they had inaccurately described the purpose of their spending. They argued that the research Perkins Coie had commissioned was part of the legal services the law firm provided, including \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin anticipation of litigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nNevertheless, the documents said, the campaign and the party agreed in February to pay civil penalties totaling $113,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 $8,000 from the campaign and $105,000 from the party \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to resolve the matter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpeditiously and to avoid further legal costs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The agreements said the campaign and the party did not concede that the Federal Election Commission was correct that they probably violated campaign finance law but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill not further contest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that finding either.\nThe commission documents said Perkins Coie \\xe2\\x80\\x94 where a partner at the time, Marc Elias, was representing the Clinton campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 paid Fusion GPS slightly more than $1 million in 2016, and the law firm was in turn paid $175,000 by the campaign and about $850,000 by the party during six weeks in July and August 2016. Campaign spending disclosure reports described most of those payments to Perkins Coie as having been for \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegal services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegal and compliance consulting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe Steele dossier was a set of reports written by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent whose research firm was a subcontractor that Fusion GPS hired to look into Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purported links to Russia. The reports cited unnamed sources who claimed that there was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell-developed conspiracy of coordination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between the Trump campaign and Russia and that Russia had a blackmail tape of Mr. Trump with prostitutes.\nIn addition to giving his reports to Perkins Coie, Mr. Steele shared some with the F.B.I. and reporters. The F.B.I. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which had opened its investigation into Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election interference operation and links to the Trump campaign on other grounds \\xe2\\x80\\x94 used part of the dossier in applications to wiretap a Trump associate. BuzzFeed published the dossier in January 2017, heightening suspicion about Mr. Trump and Russia.\nIt has become clear that the dossier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sourcing was thin. No corroborating evidence emerged in the intervening years to support many of its claims, such as the purported sex tape, and investigators determined that one key allegation \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Michael D. Cohen, had met with Russian officials in Prague during the campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was false.\nThe primary source of information in the dossier was Igor Danchenko, a researcher hired by Mr. Steele to canvass for information about Mr. Trump and Russia from people he knew, including in Europe and Russia.\nMr. Danchenko told the F.B.I. in 2017 that he thought the tenor of the dossier was more conclusive than was justified . He portrayed the story of the blackmail tape as speculation that he was unable to confirm; a key source had called him without identifying h ...evidence too long",0

But we do know that the Chinese did attempt to market a cure for the coronavirus to the world in January after the virus began to spread. According to the report from Wuhan the coronavirus came from either the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention or Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China. .\nThese reports linking bats to the coronavirus started making the rounds back in January. A research paper published in the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention determined the source of the coronavirus is a laboratory near the Seafood Market in Wuhan. .\nOn Sunday Rudy Giuliani dropped a bomb on Dr. Fauci. Rudy scolded the NIAID Director of granting $3.7 million to the Wuhan lab that leaked the coronavirus. .\nRudy Giuliani questioned Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s involvement in grants from the United States to a laboratory in Wuhan, China, that has been tied to the coronavirus pandemic.\nAccording to a report, the U.S. Intelligence Community has growing confidence that the current coronavirus strain may have accidentally escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology rather than from a wildlife market, as the Chinese Communist Party first claimed. During a Sunday interview on The Cats Roundtable, Giuliani questioned why the U.S. gave money to the lab.\n\u201cBack in 2014, the Obama administration prohibited the U.S. from giving money to any laboratory, including in the U.S., that was fooling around with these viruses.

The actual amount was just under $600,000.\nA virology lab in Wuhan, China, continues to draw scrutiny for work it did on bat viruses as part of American-funded research.\nTo be clear, there is no sign that the coronavirus that has swept around the globe was bioengineered, but suspicions run high, including from President Donald Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\nGiuliani tweeted April 26, \""Why did the US (NIH) in 2017 give $3.7m to the Wuhan Lab in China? Such grants were prohibited in 2014. Did Pres. Obama grant an exception?\"".\nWhy did the US (NIH) in 2017 give $3.7m to the Wuhan Lab in China? Such grants were prohibited in 2014. Did Pres. Obama grant an exception? April 26, 2020.\nThe policy that hit pause on certain research in 2014 didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t apply to the sort of work that was being done in Wuhan.\nIn the summer of 2014, a cardboard box of vials labeled Variola was found in an ordinary cold storage room on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The variola virus causes smallpox, and it had no place outside of a secure biological facility.\nIn August 2014, the Obama administration called for a nationwide stand-down and review for all labs working with potentially deadly biological agents. On Oct. 17, 2014 , the White House announced it would not fund new projects that involved a certain kind of research called gain-of-function.\nLike the phrase suggests, gain-of-function research boosts the ability of a pathogen to cause disease. Why would anyone want to do that, outside of building a biological weapon? Well, this sort of work can help spot potential threats and give researchers time to craft ways to thwart a new virus.\nAdministration officials said that until they had new policies, this sort of work on viruses that cause influenza, MERS and SARS (two new diseases that had triggered pandemics) wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get new money, and they asked labs with research underway to hit pause.\n\""The funding pause will not apply to the characterization or testing of naturally occurring influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses unless there is a reasonable expectation that these tests would increase transmissibility or pathogenicity,\"" the Oct. 17 policy said.\n Bill Gates claims to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvalid representative of the pharmaceutical industry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cread a lot of books about that topic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology was participating in a project led by the New York-based organization EcoHealth Alliance. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do .\\xc2\\xa0.\nIn 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed work that focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Teams in the field gathered blood from bats and local residents. They sent the samples to Wuhan where the initial analysis took place.\n\""The policy would not prohibit government agencies from funding any and all research at Wuhan Institute of Virology,\"" said Gregory Koblentz, George Mason University associate professor of biodefense.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible, Koblentz said, that some work done as part of the larger U.S. project might have involved gain-of-function experiments, but whether those would fall under the specific types of gain-of-function research covered by the restriction was doubtful.\n\""To the best of my understanding, Mr. Giuliani\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim is not consistent with reality,\"" said\\xc2\\xa0 John Holdren, one of the architects of the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy and a former assistant to the president for science and technology.\nThe work the lab did for the project did not involve gain-of-function research, but it is possible that other projects at the lab did.\nAdded Robert Kessler with the EcoHealth Alliance: \""We have not ever participated in gain-of-function research. Nor have we ever been funded to participate in gain-of-function research.\"".\nGiuliani\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim has another flaw \\xe2\\x80\\x94 timing. The moratorium policy took effect October 2014. The grant was approved at the end of May , five months earlier.\nThe NIH website shows that the total size of the grant was $3.4 million. About 15% of that went to the Wuhan lab. The grant was awarded in 2014, not 2017, as Giuliani said.\nGiuliani said that in 2017, the United States gave $3.7 million to the lab in Wuhan at a time when such a grant was prohibited.\nRedState, Rudy Giuliani Slammed Dr. Fauci Over His Agency\u2019s $3.7 Million Grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology , April 26, 2020.\nEmail exchange, John P.

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had similar folks helping Floridians navigate health care programs for many years.\nScott has sought to ban Obamacare navigators from county health departments and has faced some blowback: Broward and Pinellas counties have refused to comply and Miami-Dade may follow their lead.\nNelson portrayed Scott as a hypocrite because he said there are already similar navigators who help Floridians with questions about health insurance.\n\""State officials have so far failed to mention that these \\xe2\\x80\\x98consumer helpers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 have been serving the people of Florida in various ways for years -- and, yes, even with the current governor\\'s full backing,\"" Nelson wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed Sept. 19. \""In fact, many state and federal agencies have such \\xe2\\x80\\x98navigators\\xe2\\x80\\x99 involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example -- even buying health insurance. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right: even when buying health insurance created by the state. From Medicaid to Medicare, from veterans\\' organizations to the state\\'s own KidCare insurance program, navigators are available to make sure Floridians get assistance.\"".\nAre there already similar navigators who help the public access health insurance and other services? We went in search of the examples cited by Nelson.\nThe Affordable Care Act awarded $8 million in federal grants to eight Florida entities to hire navigators, including the University of South Florida -based program Florida Covering Kids & Families and Pinellas County . Florida state leaders declined to set up their own marketplace or work with the federal government to run it together, leaving the job to the federal government.\nNavigators must go through at least 20 hours of training and be fingerprinted before they can become certified. Their job is to offer impartial information about health plans and the availability of tax credits and subsidies to offset the cost of a plan. They are not allowed to direct consumers to specific plans or receive payments from insurers, businesses or consumers.\nIn our search for something similar to Obamacare navigators, we started with Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, which serves the poor.\n\""The navigator program is similar to Medicare counselors, which have existed for years and never faced this kind of bullying from Florida,\"" said U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman Fabien Levy.\nStates receive federal grants to hire people that help Medicare beneficiaries enroll for coverage, and this year Florida received about $3 million.\nThe Florida version of the program is called SHINE (Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders) and is overseen by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, which contracts with local Area Agency on Aging groups. Florida has 463 SHINE volunteers.\nSHINE volunteers assist seniors primarily with questions about Medicare, and sometimes Medicaid if a client qualifies for both. Outreach efforts include a helpline and spreading the word at community events.\n\""What we provide is free unbiased information,\"" said Charles Franckle, SHINE coordinator for Pinellas County. \""When people are approaching Medicare they might contact us to ask us should they sign up for Part A and B and how do they do it.\"".\nSHINE volunteers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t endorse a particular plan. But they can answer questions about the differences between the various Medicare options by teaching the callers how to use the Medicare.gov website or doing it for them and sending them the results.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nPaid employees provide Medicaid counseling through the state Agency for Health Care Administration or contracted vendors. The counselors assist recipients via phone, in writing or in person and conduct community outreach and education.\nFlorida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s KidCare health insurance program for poor children includes outreach to help families sign up for care. An outreach calendar for September showed various community events statewide where families could learn more about KidCare, such as at Pasco County\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Kids Health and Safety Day.\nA Nelson spokesman pointed to a 2012 sample contract that stated the Florida Healthy Kids Corp. was seeking grant proposals from \""eligible organizations to become Regional Navigators and assist eligible families in applying for or retaining Florida KidCare.\"".\nThree entities signed that contract: Health Council of Southeast Florida, Broward County Health Department and United Way of Marion County, according to the Florida Healthy Kids Corp.\nLegislative appropriations earmarked for Florida KidCare outreach were eliminated in July 2003, said Christie Goss, spokeswoman for Florida Healthy Kids Corp., a KidCare partner. But community groups statewide continue to promote KidCare and help the public enroll.\nThe University of South Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Covering Kids and Families, which received an Obamacare navigator grant, has been doing outreach for enrollment for KidCare and Medicaid since 1999 with state, federal and foundation grants.\n\""We work with schools, churches, hospitals, businesses, etc.,\"" said program director Jodi Ray. \""We conduct our outreach and education activities wherever we have the best chance to reach people who need this information. We also have a military outreach project that specifically focuses on making sure that both active duty and veteran families get the information they need about getting their kids covered. The enrollment assistance is an important component of the outreach efforts.\"".\nThe particular requirements and training for Obamacare navigators and those who assist Floridians with KidCare or Medicaid can vary. However, \""it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very similar in that we are helping people apply for health coverage,\"" Ray said. \""We are not collecting medical health information -- we are simply helping them understand how to navigate the process without getting overwhelmed or confused and be able to answer questions so they can make decisions they need to make.\"".\nThe Florida Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits counseling related to state and federal veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 programs. The department has paid claims examiners who work out of VA medical centers, clinics and nursing homes and provide benefits counseling to help connect Floridians to benefits such as disability payments and pensions. The counselors don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enroll veterans in health care but do point them in the right direction.\nWe sent Nelson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim and a summary of our findings of positions similar to Obamacare navigators to Scott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office and received a short reply:.\nBut spokespersons for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told us that navigators can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t access the \""hub\"" , which provides a way to transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information.\n\""Navigators won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be tied into the federal data hub. They will enroll people through the online interface that all consumers have access to at healthcare.gov ,\"" said Brian Cook, a CMS spokesman.\nWe heard other comments from state agency spokespersons about differences in the training or requirements for Obamacare navigators compared to other types of benefits counselors. But Nelson didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a claim about background checks or other requirements.\nSeeking to assuage concerns about Obamacare navigators, Nelson said, \""Many state and federal agencies have such \\xe2\\x80\\x98navigators\\xe2\\x80\\x99 involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example - even buying health insurance.\"".\nThere are differences in terms of some of the requirements and training to become an Obamacare navigator versus those who provide assistance for some of these other programs. However Nelson didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say they are identical: He said that we already have such \\xe2\\x80\\x98navigators\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to help Floridians access services.\n The 2020 election could not have been fair because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLos Angeles County agreed, during litigation, that there were 1.2 million ineligible voters after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n At a Wisconsin school, a 12-year-old girl \""was transitioned into a boy by school officials without parental consent,\"" and Protasiewicz supports it. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe gay dating app Grindr says if Florida doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop passing homophobic and transphobic laws, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll reveal every Republican legislator and party official who secretly uses the app.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ."", ""evidence"": "" \""Many state and federal agencies have such \u2018navigators\u2019 involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example -- even buying health insurance.\"""", ""nli_class"": ""entailment"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9936063""}, {""snippet"": ""Earlier this year, the governor decided to sign legislation that eliminated the Florida insurance commissioner\\'s authority to reject or modify health insurers\\' rate hikes. <b>In essence, he deregulated the industry in Florida and turned the big health insurance companies loose on the consumers he\\'s supposed to protect.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/column-state-already-uses-navigators-in-many-programs/2142581/"", ""title"": ""Column: State already uses 'navigators' in many programs"", ""full_text"": ""Regions Tampa St. Petersburg Clearwater Hillsborough Pinellas Pasco Hernando Florida Nation & World Politi Fact Topics Investigations Politics Education Business Real Estate Health Transportation Environment Crime Climate Change Reporting Network Pulitzers Centr o.\nThe governor of Florida is making it abundantly clear he will stop at nothing to sabotage the new federal health care law.

This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans.\"".\nIs Clinton correct that there have been seven and now eight investigations into Benghazi? We started counting and found she was largely accurate.\nClinton was secretary of state when Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans died in the barrage.\nIn the weeks following the attack, the White House was heavily questioned for its response to the terrorist attack. Many debated, among conflicting reports from intelligence officials, what role al-Qaeda played in the attack and how much the White House knew about the group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement. Critics also questioned whether Clinton and the State Department could have better addressed security at the U.S. facilities before they were attacked. The debate got more partisan as time went on, as Republicans began speaking of .\nThe seven probes mentioned by Clinton include only those conducted by Congress, but there was at least one more. After the attack, Clinton convened an Accountability Review Board to investigate the incident -- something she was legally required to do. The Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s found no fault in the State Department for the terrorist attacks but acknowledged \""systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies\"" that left Benghazi vulnerable. Four State Department officials were temporarily suspended and ultimately reassigned within the department.\nIt should be noted that each congressional committee that investigated the Benghazi attack looked into different aspects of the event. After the attack, Republican Speaker John Boehner directed the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence to investigate the issues within their jurisdictions. The House investigations were led by Republicans. Two bipartisan Senate Committees also investigated the attack.\nClinton said the committees found that she and her department had not committed wrongdoing but suggested changes. Actually, almost every committee report found her department did not adequately address security concerns in Libya or could have done more to prevent the attack. Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words give the best possible spin to the various committee findings, but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also essentially accurate.\nThe House Oversight Committee was one of the committees to question Clinton following the Benghazi attack. On Sept. 16, 2013, the Republican-led committee released an on the Accountability Review Board appointed by Clinton. The report raised questions about the independence and integrity of the Accountability Review Board (since Clinton appointed the board to investigate her own department) and criticized the conclusions in the board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final report.\nThis bipartisan committee a report in December 2012 detailing the \""high risk\"" of a terrorist attack at the U.S. facilities in Libya. While the criticized the State Department for not addressing the security concerns leading up to the attack, it also found \""administration officials were inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist attack.\"" The report attributed the State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s security failures to intelligence problems and a failure \""to imagine the type of attack that occurred.\"".\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee released a bipartisan in January 2014 calling the Benghazi attacks \""preventable.\"" Among other findings, the committee the State Department had received ample warning about deteriorating security in Libya and failed to adequately increase security in the weeks leading up to the attack. The report also faulted intelligence officials for not relaying information on the CIA annex to the U.S. military.\nClinton before this House committee on Jan. 23, 2013 (she also in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier that day). The House Committee on Foreign Affairs later released a criticizing Clinton and other high-ranking officials who they said were \""provided extensive warning of the deteriorating security environment in eastern Libya.\"" The report also the State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Accountability Review Board, which \""was seriously deficient in several respects,\"" especially in its failure to comment on the actions of the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest ranking officials, including Clinton.\nThe focus of the Committee on the Judiciary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probe was the FBI investigation that followed the terrorist attack. The committee released its findings in April 2013 as part of an in conjunction with the five other Republican-led committees investigating Benghazi. The report how the FBI did not investigate the scene until three weeks after the attack and spent less than one day collecting evidence in Benghazi. The committee also faulted Clinton for reducing security at the Benghazi consulate, despite her testimony that she \""had no knowledge\"" of security requests from the compound.\nThe Armed Services Committee began its investigation \""immediately after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 to evaluate the response of the Department of Defense\"" to the attack, according to a February 2014 committee . The Republican-led committee the Obama administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to address security threats in Benghazi, asserting that the military was unprepared for possible violence in Libya.\nThe House Intelligence Committee concluded its two-year Benghazi investigation in November 2014 when it a report exonerating the Obama administration of wrongdoing in its response to the attack. The found evidence of contradicting intelligence among government officials and concluded officials did not intentionally mislead the public with information in the days following the attack.\nThe Republican-led House created the House Select Committee on Benghazi in May 2014 after a conservative watchdog group discovered new State Department emails about the attacks. The committee includes seven Republicans and five Democrats. The group an interim progress report in May 2015, but the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Democrats have been outspoken on the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lack of progress.\nClinton, who has faced more scrutiny over Benghazi after it was discovered she used a private email server while serving as Secretary of State, is set before the Benghazi panel on Oct. 22.\nClinton said, \""There have been seven investigations (of Benghazi) led mostly by Republicans in the Congress\"" that concluded \""nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make.\"".\nClinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s number is correct: there were seven previous congressional probes into the Benghazi attack. Saying these committees were led \""mostly by Republicans\"" is also a fair assertion: the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs were the only two committees not led by Republicans. As for her comment that there was no overt wrongdoing, just room for improvement, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a rosy assessment. But it is also largely accurate.

They may not even poll the general election because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust their methodology.\"".\nA lot of people wonder about the accuracy of the polls, and it would be a big deal if the pollsters themselves were just as skeptical. We decided to drill down on Deace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data, and that Gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust its methodology.\nDeace told us he relied on several stories that came out recently. wrote about systematic flaws in the data. High on the list: -- the rise of cell phone-only households and a growing percentage of people who refuse to answer pollsters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 questions.\nThe best public opinion operations employ banks of callers who are fed randomly picked phone numbers. Cell phones make it tougher to determine where the interviewee actually lives, which matters a lot for state-level polls. Plus, federal rules about calling cell phones mean you must hand-dial each one, rather than use a faster automated dialer. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a significant cost factor.\nAnd then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the response rate. When more people hang up, that raises questions about whether the people who participate are unrepresentative of the public at large.\nThere was also a report\\xc2\\xa0from Politico that carried a . They said they shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the ones \""to winnow the GOP field.\"".\nThe point was, news organizations sponsoring debates are counting on polls to decide who to bring on the stage and who to cut. With over a dozen Republican candidates, many of them clustered in the single-digits, the differences between any two are nearly certain to be smaller than the polls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 well-published margin of error.\nIf just 1 percentage point separates Candidate A from Candidate B, and the margin of error is 3.5 percent, you have a problem.\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a problem that stems from the polling itself. As the Politico article noted, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem with how debate organizers are using the polls.\nSo those two articles are the grounds for the first part of Deace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement. Then there was his comment about Gallup. The bombshell in the polling world, as these things go, was Gallup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to pull back from tracking the presidential primaries. This came out in another Politico article headlined, \"" .\"".\n\""After a bruising 2012 cycle, in which its polls were farther off than most of its competitors, Gallup told Politico it isn\\'t planning any polls for the presidential primary horse race this cycle,\"" Politico wrote. \""And, even following an internal probe into what went wrong last time around, Gallup won\\'t commit to tracking the general election next year.\"".\nGallup is one of the granddaddies of polling and had done a lot of polls in past elections. It was no small thing for the primaries to lose such a prominent player.\nFrank Newport, Gallup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s editor-in-chief, told Politico that the polling firm thought it could have more impact by asking people what they think about issues, rather than who they want to see in the White House.\nWhile the article drew a connection between Gallup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move and its polling methods, Newport himself didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that. And afterward, he sent around a statement rebutting the story\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broader implication.\n\""Unlike some critics, we at Gallup remain very strong in our belief in the accuracy of polling today, even with the new challenges that are in front of the industry,\"" Newport said. \""Our post-mortem work in 2012/2013 and our experimentation in the 2014 midterms leave us with little doubt that polling, including our own, can be accurate in 2016.\"".\nCharles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, told us he thinks this was more a business decision, but the picture is complicated. Gallup does a lot of contract work for businesses, and in\\xc2\\xa0that context, political polling comes with a risk.\n\""You can be judged by how you do on the presidential vote in November,\"" Franklin said. \""If you have troubles with that, it creates problems for the company.\"".\nFranklin said he thinks Gallup does as good a job as anybody, but he can see why the firm might decide it makes more sense to pull back from election tracking.\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no question that it has become trickier and more expensive to be accurate. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also clear that the better financed pollsters adapt. Statistics researchers Ole Forsberg and Mark Payton at Oklahoma State University focused on the cell phone issue. Forsberg told us the pollsters have come up with a variety of approaches. He said while we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know which ones work best until this election is over, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s optimistic.\n\""The current polling methods are most likely more accurate than in 2012,\"" Forsberg said. \""They may be more accurate than in 2008. They are most likely worse than in 2004.\"".\nPolling in 2004 was more reliable because landlines were more common back then, and landlines are inherently easier to work with than cell phones.\n\""We have to call many more numbers to get a big enough sample size, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plenty of evidence that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reaching enough,\"" he said.\nHistorical trends collected by the , a trade association of pollsters, track the gap between polling and actual voting results in presidential years. In 2012, the average error was 1.46 percentage points. That was slightly higher than in the previous three elections in 2008, 2004 and 2000, but less than the error in 1996 when it was 2.1 percentage points.\nJon Krosnick at Stanford University has assessed polls for many years. Krosnick distinguishes between polling organizations that dot their I\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and cross their T\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and those that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\n\""Our evaluations of survey accuracy indicate that surveys done using best practices, which is expensive, continue to be remarkably accurate,\"" Krosnick said. \""If you look at the average of the final pre-election polls done by the neutral news organizations that used high quality methods just before the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, they predicted the national popular vote within one percentage point.\"".\nKrosnick said the danger lies in the proliferation of firms that do polling on the cheap. Those results, he said, could give the impression that polling in general is less accurate.\nAll that said, Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers University political scientist and former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, warns that no one should underestimate the challenges polling faces today. Zukin said there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge issue of figuring out who will actually vote and all the problems only get worse at the state level where much of the attention is focused during the primaries.\n\""We are less sure how to conduct good survey research now than we were four years ago, and much less than eight years ago,\"" Zukin wrote in an .\nA particularly subtle form of error seems to have crept into the picture. Nate Silver, a statistician who grew famous for his accurate election predictions and is now editor-in-chief of 538.com, has written about the \""herding\"" phenomenon. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when polling firms fear to publish results that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t track with other polls.\n\""Pollsters have admitted to suppressing polls they deem to be outliers but that would have turned out to be just right,\"" Silver . \""In the U.S. last year, at least two polling firms declined to publish surveys showing a tight Senate race in Virginia, which in the end was decided by only 18,000 votes in what was almost a historic upset.\"".\nFrom what we found, most research into polling accuracy looks at surveys done in the final weeks of a campaign. Right now, we are nearly four months before the first ballot is cast in Iowa. Deace said he thinks the polls are a joke because he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they reflect who will carry the caucuses.\n\""This is very much like midway through the second quarter of a football game,\"" he said. \""It is not telling you with great certainty who will win the game. But it is telling you who\\'s playing well and who isn\\'t. And we still have the second half to play.\"".\nFranklin said, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the score at halftime tells the whole story, you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect any more from polls at this stage of the primary process.\nDeace said pollsters are warning people not to trust their results and that Gallup doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trust its methodology. The articles he cited actually were more specific than he suggested. Pollsters did say that surveys can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be used with surgical precision to separate the wheat from the chaff in the crowded Republican field. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in response to broadcasters who have counted on polls to decide who should appear in debates.\nAs for Gallup, a news article implied that concerns over methodology drove its decision to stop tracking the primaries, but the editor-in-chief at Gallup didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that and in fact, he expressed confidence in the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s techniques.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s costing more and more to do polling well, and state-level polls, which are the ones Deace had in mind, face the biggest challenges. But overall, Deace exaggerated what pollsters have said.\n Kari Lake has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgone on the record saying she supports Arizona\\'s complete abortion ban.

They include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit (see details below). Both credits are considered valuable, given that they are refundable \\xe2\\x80\\x94 meaning that even if your tax bill is zero, you can get some or all of the credits refunded to you.\n\""There are plenty of people in that income group that will owe income taxes,\"" Maag said. \""Those are the averages for everyone.\"".\nFor example, if you earn money from a job (versus from, say, investments), you pay taxes into Social Security and Medicare. Those so-called payroll taxes equate to 7.65%, which your employer withholds from your paycheck (and contributes the same amount \\xe2\\x80\\x94 7.65% \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to those programs on your behalf).\nIf you are self-employed, you pay both shares yourself, or 15.3% (although you can deduct half of that elsewhere on your tax return).\nAbout 53% of Americans had an annual household income of less than $75,000 in 2019, according to the latest data from Statista. Median household income in the U.S. that year was about $68,700, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nHere's a look at more on how to manage, grow and protect your money. Why 75% of stock owners won't be hit by Biden's capital gains tax hike Latest batch of stimulus checks go those recently filing tax returns Advisors must meet the digital demands of young investors.\n\""The group not paying federal income taxes in any given year tend to be moderate income with children, as well as older people, who may not have earnings that they are paying tax on,\"" Maag said.\nPresident Joe Biden's next move to change individual taxes is expected to target higher-earning households. That could come in the form of increasing the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from the current 37% and changing the top capital gains tax rate to 39.6%, as well, from 20%.\nAs for details of the credits: The child tax credit is enhanced for 2021 in several ways, including by raising the per-child payment to $3,000 from $2,000 for families with income below certain thresholds (phase-outs begin at $75,000 for singles, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples), with an extra $600 for children under age 6. Children age 17 also qualify for the first time.\nThe earned income tax credit for childless workers also has been expanded by boosting the maximum credit in 2021 for that cohort to $1,502 from $543, research from the Tax Foundation shows. The benefit would be realized when taxpayers file their 2021 returns in spring 2022.\nThe bill also raises the income level (to $9,820 from $4,220) at which the earned income tax credit reaches its maximum, and changes the phaseout to begin at $11,610 instead of $5,280 for individual tax filers.

The post included a screenshot of a tweet that reads: .\nWait, so Trump passed a bill in 2017 where ppl who make under $75,000 will have their taxes raised in 2021 and every 2 years after that until 2027.... while the rich get richer.... and y\\'all crying about Biden raising taxes for ppl who make over 400k? What am I missing.. .\nAccording to the Twitter thread from the user who published the tweet, the claim was made based on an opinion article published by The New York Times and written by Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics. The article cited information (shown in a screenshot from the Tax Foundation here) from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to support its assertion of the tax increase. Stiglitz said: .\nPeople with incomes between $10,000 and $30,000 -- nearly one-quarter of Americans -- are among those scheduled to pay a higher average tax rate in 2021 than in years before the tax \\'cut\\' was passed. .\nHowever, other independent, nonpartisan tax experts did not share this perspective. Both the Tax Foundation and the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center reported that the TCJA allowed for tax cuts for most individuals between 2018 and 2025. In an article published on November 18, 2020, by Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, Watson explained that a change to the Affordable Care Act\\'s individual mandate played a role in the figures presented by the JCT: .\nThe TCJA reduced the Affordable Care Act\\'s (ACA) individual mandate to $0, thus reducing the incentive to purchase qualified insurance and receive related premium tax credits, particularly for lower-income individuals. The reduction in premium tax credits appears as a tax increase for low-income individuals in the JCT distribution tables.\nWhile it is important to consider the impact of the TCJA on premium tax credits and health insurance take-up, it is misleading to call this effect a \\'stealth tax increase.\\' The decline in premium tax credits has nothing to do with a change in tax rates or the generosity of the credits as established under the ACA, but rather due to voluntary decisions individuals make about whether to purchase qualified health insurance. .\nIn an email to Lead Stories on February 22, 2022, Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies federal tax policy, reaffirmed that the TCJA actually cuts taxes for most individuals from 2018 to 2025. He explained that there are tax increases for businesses between 2020 and 2025: .\nFor example, this year, the tax treatment of research and development costs and interest expense will change, raising taxes on businesses. In 2023, the tax treatment of capital investments will worsen, further raising taxes. .\nTo be clear, these \\'tax increases\\' somewhat offset the tax cuts for businesses-on net businesses still receive a tax cut. And since businesses are primarily owned by high-income households, these tax increases will offset the tax cuts these households are receiving.

They include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit (see details below). Both credits are considered valuable, given that they are refundable \\xe2\\x80\\x94 meaning that even if your tax bill is zero, you can get some or all of the credits refunded to you.\nFor example, if you earn money from a job (versus from, say, investments), you pay taxes into Social Security and Medicare. Those so-called payroll taxes equate to 7.65%, which your employer withholds from your paycheck (and contributes the same amount \\xe2\\x80\\x94 7.65% \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to those programs on your behalf).\nIf you are self-employed, you pay both shares yourself, or 15.3% (although you can deduct half of that elsewhere on your tax return).\nIndividual income Projected average income tax rate, 2021 Under $75,000 < 0% $75,000-$100,000 1.80% $100,000-$200,000 5.70% $200,000-$500,000 13% $500,000-$1 mil 20.80% Over $1 mil 25.80%.\nAbout 53% of Americans had an annual household income of less than $75,000 in 2019, according to the latest data from Statista. Median household income in the U.S. that year was about $68,700, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\""The group not paying federal income taxes in any given year tend to be moderate income with children, as well as older people, who may not have earnings that they are paying tax on,\"" Maag said.\nAs for details of the credits: The child tax credit is enhanced for 2021 in several ways, including by raising the per-child payment to $3,000 from $2,000 for families with income below certain thresholds (phaseouts begin at $75,000 for singles, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married couples), with an extra $600 for children under age 6. Children age 17 also qualify for the first time.\nThe earned income tax credit for childless workers also has been expanded by boosting the maximum credit in 2021 for that cohort to $1,502 from $543, according to the Tax Foundation. The benefit would be realized when taxpayers file their 2021 returns in spring 2022.\nThe bill also raises the income level (to $9,820 from $4,220) at which the earned income tax credit reaches its maximum, and changes the phaseout to begin at $11,610 instead of $5,280 for individual tax filers. The ages for qualifying for the credit also are changed for this year: The minimum age is 19 instead of 24 and the maximum age of 65 would be eliminated.\nData is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutes.

Baldwin Succeeded by Richard Schmidt (acting) Earnell R. Lucas (elected) .\nDavid Alexander Clarke Jr. ( 1956-08-21 ) August 21, 1956 (age\u00a066) Milwaukee , Wisconsin , U.S. Democratic [A] Julie Clarke ( 2018) Concordia University Wisconsin ( BA ) Naval Postgraduate School ( MA ).\nDavid Alexander Clarke, Jr. , (born August 21, 1956) is an American former law enforcement official who served as Sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin , from 2002 to 2017. .\nIn 2002, Clarke was appointed to the position by Republican Governor Scott McCallum and later elected that same year to his first four-year term. He was reelected in November 2006, 2010 and 2014. Although Clarke declared himself as a Democrat after his appointment as sheriff and ran as a Democrat in a heavily Democratic county, many of Clarke\\'s political views align with those of conservative Republicans ; he refused to join the Wisconsin Democratic Party , instead promoting conservative views, and allying himself with Republican officials. .\nAs sheriff, Clarke frequently clashed with other Milwaukee County officials over the budget and other matters, and came under scrutiny for deaths and alleged mistreatment of jail inmates. One man died of thirst in what a coroner ruled was a homicide, and pregnant women were handcuffed and shackled while undergoing labor. Clarke frequently appeared as a guest on Fox News through February 2018 and was a speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention . He resigned as sheriff in August 2017. A vocal supporter of President Donald Trump , Clarke garnered attention for controversial and sometimes inflammatory social-media posts, and was considered for a role in the Trump administration. After resigning as sheriff, Clarke joined the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor; he left the group in 2019. Early life, education, and early career .\nClarke was born in Milwaukee, one of five children of Jeri and David Clarke Sr. [1] His father was a paratrooper with the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company . His uncle was NFL player Frank Clarke , whom he idolized. [2] .\nClarke Jr. attended Marquette University High School where he played for the varsity basketball team. [1] After finishing high school, Clarke took classes at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee but dropped out during his first year when he got a job driving beer trucks. [1] .\nHis career in law enforcement began in 1978 at the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD). He \""rose through the ranks at a slow but steady pace in his 24 years with the department.\"" Clarke was a patrol officer for eleven years and then a homicide detective; he was promoted to lieutenant of detectives in 1993 and captain in 1999. [1] .\nClarke\\'s career was not without controversy; in 1994, the mother of a 15-year-old boy filed a complaint alleging that Clarke used excessive force when arresting her son. According to public documents, Clarke was returning from a vacation when he spotted five teenagers heaving rocks at passing cars. Clarke chased down the teens, drew his service revolver and ordered them to lie on the ground. He admitted to using his foot to turn one boy over as he searched for weapons. The boy\\'s mother claimed Clarke put a gun to her son\\'s head and kicked him in the side, causing bruised ribs that required medical attention.\u00a0However, the Fire and Police Commission ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge Clarke and dismissed the case. [1] .\nIn 1999, Clarke received a B.A. in Management of Criminal Justice from Concordia University Wisconsin \\'s School of Adult and Continuing Education. [3] In January 2002, Milwaukee County Sheriff Leverett F. Baldwin resigned midway through his term to take a pension payout. Clarke was one of ten applicants for the position, and Governor Scott McCallum appointed him on March 19, 2002. [1] He was elected to a full term later in 2002, and was reelected in 2006, 2010, and 2014. [4] Master\\'s thesis plagiarism .\nIn 2013, Clarke received a master\\'s degree in security studies from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). In May 2017, CNN reported that Clarke had plagiarized portions of the thesis he completed as part of the requirements for this degree, stating that in the thesis, \""Clarke failed to properly attribute his sources at least 47 times.\"" [5] The thesis (\""Making U.S. security and privacy rights compatible\"") [6] was found to have lifted material verbatim from several sources without proper citation, including reports by the American Civil Liberties Union , The 9/11 Commission Report , and George W. Bush\\'s memoir Decision Points . Clarke provided footnotes to sources that he used, but did not properly place quotations around verbatim words of his sources, which is an act of plagiarism according to the NPS. [5] Following the report, the NPS removed the thesis from its online archive. [7] In response to the report, Clarke called journalist Andrew Kaczynski , who broke the story, a \""sleaze bag\"" and denied that he had plagiarized. [8] .\nIn a July 2017 letter to Clarke, NPS dean of students , Commander Paul Rasmussen, wrote that he concurred with the Honor Code Board that Clarke\\'s thesis was \""in violation\"" of the school\\'s honor code but that the \""violation was not a result of any intentional deception or misappropriation efforts.\"" Rasmussen instructed Clarke to submit a revised thesis within 100 days or NPS would \""initiate degree revocation.\"" [9] Clarke received several extensions on the original deadline before submitting his revised thesis in March 2018; NPS officials informed Clarke that his edits were satisfactory, and allowed him to retain his degree. [10] Political views .\nClarke has \""built a following among conservatives with his provocative social media presence and strong support of Donald Trump.\"" [11] His prominence as a right-wing firebrand has made him a controversial and polarizing figure. [12] [13] [14] Planned Parenthood .\nIn 2015, Clarke received criticism for his statement on his podcast: \""Let me tell you why blacks sell drugs and involve themselves in criminal behavior instead of a more socially acceptable lifestyle: because they\\'re uneducated, they\\'re lazy and they\\'re morally bankrupt. That\\'s why.\"" [17] .\nIn 2017, Clarke attracted attention and criticism for trading racial insults with Marc Lamont Hill , an African-American CNN commentator; on Twitter, Clarke used a racial slur (\"" jigaboo \"") to insult Hill. [18] [19] [20] Black Lives Matter .\nClarke is a frequent and vociferous critic of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, referring to it as \""Black Lies Matter\"" and describing the movement as a hate group . [21] [22] Clarke denies that police officers are more willing to shoot black suspects than white suspects, has labeled BLM activists \""subhuman creeps\"", and has called for the targeted eradication of the movement \""from American society.\"" [22] He has also claimed that Black Lives Matter would eventually join forces with ISIS in order to destroy American society. [23] He has urged the Southern Poverty Law Center to include BLM among the hate groups it monitors. [24] Clarke has blamed \""liberal policies\"" for rioting and other issues in American cities. [25] Clarke\\'s stance on the movement has been criticized by the Milwaukee chapter of the NAACP and other activists. [22] .\nClarke has harshly criticized various black critics of police abuses. [26] He has called former Attorney General Eric Holder an \""a[ss]hole\"" and accused him in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee of \""outright hostility\"" toward police, referred to Al Sharpton as a \""charlatan\"" and criticized Beyonc\\xc3\\xa9 for her reference to the Black Panthers in her halftime-show performance at the 2016 Super Bowl . [26] Gun control .\nIn January 2013, Clarke was featured on a series of public radio ads that said citizens could no longer rely on the police for timely protection and should arm themselves. Later that month, Clarke appeared on the CNN program Piers Morgan Live , with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett , who \""said it was irresponsible of Clarke to \\'basically imply\\' that it won\\'t help citizens to call 911 when they need help.\"" [27] .\nIn 2015, Clarke traveled to Moscow on a $40,000 trip, with all expenses paid by the NRA , Pete Brownell (an NRA board member and CEO of a gun-parts supply company) and \""The Right to Bear Arms,\"" a Russian pro-firearms organization, founded by Maria Butina , a Russian national, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to being an unregistered Russian agent . [28] [29] [30] [31] During the meeting, Clarke met the Russian foreign minister and attended a conference at which Russian official Aleksander Torshin , a close ally of Vladimir Putin , spoke. [30] [31] .\nIn 2018, Clarke attracted attention for using Twitter to promote a conspiracy theory about the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida ; Clarke tweeted that \""The well ORGANIZED effort by Florida school students demanding gun control has GEORGE SOROS\\' FINGERPRINTS all over it\"", suggesting that the students from Parkland were being manipulated by Soros to organize for gun control. [32] [33] [34] Suspension of in the United States .\nClarke has called for the suspension of in the United States in a December 2015 appearance on his radio program, where he asserted that there were \""hundreds of thousands\"" or \""maybe a million\"" people who \""have pledged allegiance or are supporting ISIS, giving aid and comfort,\"" and stated that \""our commander in chief ought to utilize Article I, Section 9\"" to imprison them at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp \""and hold them indefinitely under a suspension of habeas corpus.\"" [35] [36] Ideology and relationships with Republican and Democratic parties .\nAfter his appointment to the sheriff\\'s post by McCallum, Clarke declared himself as Democrat, but refused to join the Wisconsin Democratic Party , instead promoting conservative views, [37] [38] [39] and allying himself with Republican officials. [39] Clarke ran for sheriff as a Democrat, which is advantageous in heavily Democratic Milwaukee County. However, Clarke is almost universally regarded as a staunch right-wing conservative. [40] [41] Clarke frequently criticizes Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and other Democrats; often speaks at Republican events, and is allies with the National Rifle Association , which has raised funds for his re-election campaigns. [40] Clarke has in turn been criticized by the local Democratic Party. [42] On his website in 2014, Clarke stated that he questioned \""why the Office of Sheriff is a partisan election\"" and wrote: \""I have never asked a person to vote for me because I run as a Democrat. I ask them to vote for me based on my 35-year commitment to keeping citizens safe. Most voters get it when it comes to public safety. There is no Democrat or Republican way to be a sheriff. The enemy is not the opposing party; the enemy is the criminal.\"" [43] [44] .\nIn 2016, Maurice Chammah of The Marshall Project characterized Clarke as an \""iconoclastic sheriff,\"" one of \""a long line of controversy-courting lawmen\"" that includes Richard Mack and Joe Arpaio in Arizona. [45] Clarke attracted attention for \""dalliances with the far right\"" over time including his acceptance in 2013 of the \""Sheriff of the Year Award\"" from the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association , a group of sheriffs founded by Mack that has been criticized by the Southern Poverty Law Center for espousing radical-right views. [46] Earlier the same year, Clarke appeared for an interview on the syndicated show of Alex Jones . [46] Sheriff of Milwaukee Budget and clashes with the Government of Milwaukee County .\nClarke has often clashed with the county government over the sheriff\\'s office budget, engaging \""in a long-running, high-profile tiff\"" over the issue with Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele , \""with Clarke providing the more incendiary rhetoric.\"" Abele\\'s proposed budget for 2014 would cut $12 million from the Sheriff\\'s Office budget, eliminating 69 jobs and \""shifting park patrols, emergency management, 911 communications and training divisions\"" to other entities, such as the Milwaukee Police Department, suburban police departments, and the county Department of Emergency Preparedness. Abele described the budget as a way to refocus the sheriff\\'s office on \""core, mandated services.\"" Clarke issued a statement calling Abele a \""vindictive little man\"" and saying that \""Abele should be drug-tested. He has to be on heroin or hallucinating with that statement.\"" Abele responded by saying that it was \""unfortunate the sheriff, instead of engaging in thoughtful civil discourse, is making personal attacks and making light of a serious problem in our community and state.\"" [47] .\nIn 2015, Clarke clashed with Abele again after Clarke filed a lawsuit against the county over the sheriff\\'s budget, seeking $25 million in funds to hire 75 deputies, 43 House of Corrections officers and 17 supervisors. Clarke argued that his office is underfunded by the county, while Abele noted that the sheriff\\'s office had received the largest increase of any county department and criticized Clarke for having what he termed \""a very heavy command staff,\"" \""a lot of unnecessary overtime,\"" and redundancies in courthouse security. [48] Clarke sued Abele, alleging that he had violated Clarke\\'s right to free speech through the budget process; a federal judge dismissed Clarke\\'s suit in April 2016. [49] .\nA county audit released in 2012 showed that the Milwaukee County Sheriff\\'s Office used asset forfeiture funds to buy exercise equipment for Clarke\\'s command staff, for a Disney training, and for a mounted patrol unit. The audit reported that the spending violated county procurement rules, although not federal rules on the use of seized money. Clarke was criticized for the amount of money spent on the mounted patrol by County Supervisor Patricia Jursik; Clarke defended the office\\'s use of the funds. [50] .\nAccording to an Associated Press tally, from 2012 to April 2016, Clarke had incurred more than $310,000 in legal fees for his private attorney, who represented him in litigation against Milwaukee County. [49] Milwaukee County taxpayers paid the legal fees. [49] The county spent an additional $83,000 defending itself against Clarke\\'s lawsuits. [49] .\nIn 2012, the Milwaukee County Sheriff\\'s office under Clarke spent $75,000 on an order of 565 new Glock handguns with \""glow-in-the-dark\"" sights, \""enough to outfit each of the department\\'s 275 deputies with two of the popular guns and still have some left over.\"" [51] The order was criticized as excessive by critics, including county Supervisor John Weishan Jr. (who said there \""was absolutely no reason to justify\"" the purchase) and the Milwaukee County Deputy Sheriffs Association president (who said that he would have preferred the sheriff\\'s department to use funds to re-hire laid-off deputies rather than to replace weapons). [51] Clarke declined to comment, but a department official defended the purchase. [51] Potential mayoral run .\nIn January 2014, Clarke announced he was considering a run for mayor of Milwaukee in 2016 , [52] but ultimately decided not to run, [53] instead endorsing Republican Alderman Bob Donovan\\'s unsuccessful bid to unseat Mayor Tom Barrett . [54] [55] House of Correction and detainee abuse controversies .\nIn January 2008, a National Institute of Corrections audit of the Milwaukee County House of Correction in Franklin identified 44 areas of concern, calling the House of Correction \""dysfunctional\"" and determining that it suffered from \""serious security, staff morale and management flaws.\"" The House of Corrections was at the time a separate Milwaukee County department overseen by a superintendent who reported to then Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker . Walker and the County Board transferred control over the House to the Sheriff\\'s Department under Clarke on January 1, 2009. [50] .\nClarke was repeatedly accused of abusing detainees at the county jail. [56] Following the deaths of four inmates at the jail in six months, the United States Department of Justice launched an investigation of the jail. [56] Milwaukee County chief medical examiner Brian Peterson accused Clarke of verbally harassing and threatening him in an October 2016 telephone conversation after Peterson\\'s office made the mysterious deaths of two inmates at the jail earlier that year public. [56] [57] According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Clarke also attracted attention for temper-related incidents: \""He once berated a 911 dispatcher for not being professional, threatened to arrest the new House of Correction chief and called a sergeant a \\'terrorist\\' and \\'cancer\\' in a two-hour, expletive-filled rant\"". [57] Death of Terrill Thomas .\nThe Milwaukee County Jail turned the water off to inmate Terrill Thomas\\'s cell, resulting in his death by dehydration on April 24, 2016. According to inmates, the water was turned off for six days and the staff refused to provide water to Thomas. On September 15, 2016, the Milwaukee medical examiner ruled Thomas\\'s death a homicide. [58] Later that day Clarke\\'s office sent out a press release which stated it would be \""withholding employee internal investigations and will not be commenting on this matter until the completion of all investigative and review processes, and any resultant civil litigation.\"" [59] [60] Clarke did not comment publicly on his agency\\'s handling of Thomas\\'s incarceration, but has highlighted Thomas\\'s poor physical health and criminal history. [61] [62] .\nIn May 2017, after hearing six days of testimony at an inquest, a Milwaukee County jury found probable cause that seven jail employees (two supervisors, five officers) had committed a crime\u2014specifically, abuse of a resident of a penal facility\u2014and recommended that charges be brought. [63] In February 2018, three Milwaukee jail officers were charged with a felony in connection with Thomas\\'s death. Clarke was not charged. District Attorney John T. Chisholm said \""he believed his office had charged the people who were most culpable.\"" [64] .\nIn May 2019, Milwaukee County and the health care company Armor Correctional Health Services Inc. settled the lawsuit for $6.75 million, which is one of the largest settlements related to the death of an inmate in an American prison. [65] Death of newborn and shackling of pregnant women .\nClarke\\'s department came under fire for its use of restraints on pregnant women inmates. [66] [67] This controversial practice has been abolished or restricted by at least ten states and has been prohibited by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections [68] as well as by the Federal Bureau of Prisons . [66] .\nIn 2014, a woman who was handcuffed and shackled for 21 hours while in labor sued the county. [66] [68] In 2017, a second lawsuit was filed by another woman who was shackled while giving birth, and while hospitalized for prenatal care and postpartum treatment. The suit contends that the jail has a blanket policy of shackling all hospitalized inmates, \""regardless of their criminal or medical history,\"" and that at least 40 women were shackled in this manner. [66] .\nIn June 2017, a federal jury awarded $6.7 million in a lawsuit by a woman who accused a Milwaukee County Jail guard of raping her on at least five occasions when she was 19 years old and pregnant. [69] Criminal charges of sexual assault had been dropped against the guard after he pled no contest to lesser charges in 2014. [70] .\nIn July 2016, a pregnant inmate at the jail with serious mental illness went into labor and the newborn baby died. The mother filed a federal lawsuit against the Milwaukee County Sheriff\\'s Office, stating that she was denied medical attention before her pregnancy, had medical appointments canceled, received prenatal vitamins only once, and was \""laughed at\"" by guards after going into labor. [71] This death and others at the jail prompted calls for Clarke\\'s resignation from a county supervisor and several Democratic state legislators. [71] Proselytism lawsuit .\nIn 2006, Clarke invited members of an Evangelical Christian organization, the Fellowship of Christian Centurions, to speak at several mandatory employee meetings , at which the group members proselytized . Several deputies complained about the Centurions\\' proselytizing, but Clarke refused to stop the presentations. The sheriff deputies\\' union and two individual sheriff\\'s deputies (a Catholic and a Muslim) successfully sued Clarke in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin . Clarke appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , which upheld the lower court\\'s ruling in 2009. The sheriff did not seek review in the U.S. Supreme Court. [72] [73] Airport harassment and abuse-of-power investigation and lawsuit .\nIn February 2017, a Detroit-area man, Dan Black, filed a harassment lawsuit against Clarke after Milwaukee deputies detained the man at the Milwaukee airport in January. The man had asked Clarke about his football team preference and shook his head at Clarke. [74] On the tarmac, Clarke sent text messages to one of his captains, Mark Witek, directing sheriffs\\' deputies to detain Black. Clarke wrote: \""Question for him is why he said anything to me. Why didn\\'t he just keep his mouth shut? Follow him to baggage and out the door. You can escort me to carousel after I point him out.\"" [75] After arriving at the airport, Black was \""met by a group of six uniformed deputies and two dogs, all of whom were accompanied by the sheriff\"" who questioned him before releasing him. [74] Airport surveillance video showed Black telling deputies: \""He [Clarke] thinks because I asked who he is, he can exert that kind of power over me.\"" [76] Local media reported that \""at least one of the deputies who was ordered to confront Black didn\\'t believe he had been disruptive.\"" [76] .\nAfter Black filed a complaint with the Milwaukee County Sheriff\\'s Office, Clarke responded by taunting and threatening Black via Facebook. [77] [74] Black\\'s counsel states that Clarke engaged in a \""gross and arbitrary abuse of power \"" and ordered an unlawful stop and detention. [77] An ensuing civil lawsuit by Black resulted in 2018 in a verdict in Clarke\\'s favor; the jury found that Clarke\\'s Facebook posts did not chill Black\\'s exercise of his First Amendment rights. [78] .\nThe incident drew national attention, prompting federal investigations to examine Clarke\\'s conduct. [75] In a May 2017 letter, the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office declined to prosecute Clarke for federal civil-rights offenses, writing: \""Our decision is not meant to affirm the wisdom or propriety of what occurred. It reflects only our belief that it would be difficult or impossible to prove a violation of the only federal statute available to us ... beyond a reasonable doubt.\"" [75] .\nMilwaukee County auditors launched an investigation into whether Clarke abused taxpayer resources during the airport incident. [74] Clarke refused to cooperate with the investigation, [75] and blocked auditors from interviewing Milwaukee County sheriff\\'s deputies. [74] Clarke\\'s refusal to cooperate in the investigation prompted the Milwaukee County Board to authorize legal action against Clarke on the issue. [74] An affidavit filed by the FBI in March 2017 (and made public in December 2017) indicated that \""investigators for the Audit Services Division of the Milwaukee County controller\\'s office determined as part of its own investigation that Clarke had \\'used his official position as sheriff of Milwaukee County in excess of his lawful authority to direct his deputies to stop and question Black without legal justification.\\'\"" [79] Approval ratings .\nIn a January 2017 poll conducted by Public Policy Polling , which surveyed Milwaukee County voters, 31% approved of the job Clarke was doing, compared to 62% who disapproved. In the same poll, 65% said they believed Clarke had a negative impact on the image of Milwaukee County, and among registered Democrats, 13% said they would vote for Clarke in a hypothetical Democratic primary, compared to 82% who would prefer another candidate. [80] Donald Trump support and possible role in Trump administration .\nClarke is a strong supporter of Republican Donald Trump , saying during Trump\\'s 2016 presidential campaign that he would \""do everything I can\"" to help Trump win the presidency. [81] Clarke spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio . [82] In October 2016, Clarke tweeted, \""It\\'s incredible that our institutions of gov, WH, Congress, DOJ, and big media are corrupt & all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.\"" with an attached photo of an angry mob holding pitchforks and torches. [83] [84] Clarke met with Trump, when Trump was president-elect, about a possible position in his administration. [85] .\nIn May 2017, Clarke said in a radio interview that he would take the post of Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Partnership and Engagement in the Trump administration . The White House declined to comment, and the Department of Homeland Security stated that no appointment had been officially made. The position does not require Senate confirmation . [11] [86] .\nThe DHS did not say whether the appointment was actually offered to Clarke. [87] Following a CNN report on plagiarism in his master\\'s thesis, Clarke said that he was unsure if the Trump administration would hire him. [88] .\nThe prospective appointment of Clarke was criticized by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele ; former Homeland Security official Juliette Kayyem ; and California Senator Kamala Harris , who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee . Harris wrote that \""Clarke\\'s unconscionable record makes him unfit to serve\"" and that the \""appointment is a disgrace.\"" [86] On June 17, Clarke rescinded his acceptance of the post. [89] John F. Kelly , who had been the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time, told Clarke that he would not be given a position at the DHS in part due to scandal surrounding the treatment of inmates in Clarke\\'s jail and the ensuing negative media attention. [90] Conservative media commentary and absences from Milwaukee County .\nClarke \""has become a fixture of conservative media\"" and in 2015 began hosting a podcast talk show, , on Glenn Beck \\'s TheBlaze Radio Network , [26] where he has expressed support for the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge . [91] Clarke also frequently appeared as a guest on Fox News , and on one occasion in September 2015 guest-hosted The Sean Hannity Show . [26] However, in March 2019, reported that Clarke had essentially been banned from Fox News and that he had not appeared on Fox News since February 2018. [92] He also appeared on CNN, Fox News, and other major news outlets to discuss ongoing police controversies. [25] .\nClarke\\'s higher profile coincided with an increase in his speaking fees and time spent outside Milwaukee County on outside activities. [93] In 2015 financial disclosure documents, Clarke reported receiving $150,000 in speaking fees, travel reimbursements, gifts and other items; [93] in 2016, he received $220,000 worth of such items. [94] Also in 2016, Clarke spent about 60 days traveling or attending events, 59 of them outside Wisconsin. [94] Clarke\\'s absences from the county, as well as redactions in his official schedule as provided to journalists who made public-records requests, led to \""increasing scrutiny over his job performance\"" from local media outlets and criticism from the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council. [95] Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele has repeatedly criticized Clarke\\'s absences from the county. [94] [96] Resignation as sheriff .\nA few days after his resignation as sheriff, it was announced that Clarke had joined pro- Donald Trump super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor, [99] where his role was to make regular appearances in the media, particularly on Fox News. [100] However, by March 2019, Clarke was reportedly banned from Fox News (his last appearance on a Fox channel occurring in February 2018); Clarke repeatedly criticized Fox and praised the right-wing One America News Network . [100] The cause of Clarke\\'s break with Fox News was unclear, although Clarke\\'s inflammatory Twitter posts and attacks on the high-school students victimized in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida may have played a role. [100] By early 2019, Clarke had also left his position with the Trump\\'s America First Action super PAC; a Clarke staffer said that he had joined Brian Kolfage \\'s and Steve Bannon \\'s \"" We Build The Wall \"" group instead. [100] .\nIn January 2018, Clarke was temporarily suspended by Twitter after posting three messages appearing to encourage violence against the media, including a tweet reading \""Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD.\"" Clarke was unblocked by Twitter after deleting the posts. [104] [105] .\nLater in 2018, Clarke was featured on Sacha Baron Cohen \\'s spoof comedy series Who Is America? , being interviewed by Baron Cohen\\'s alter-ego, far-Right YouTuber OMGWhizzBoyOMG. .\nIn March 2020, Twitter deleted three of Clarke\\'s posts for promoting disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic . [106] One of his tweets proclaimed that COVID-19 was \""just the damn flu\"" while another called measures to prevent the spread of the virus \""an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism.\"" [107] Clarke responded by labeling Twitter administrators \""totalitarian bigots\"" [108] and saying that he would join Parler instead. [106] [108] .\nIn August 2020, a report in itemized Clarke\\'s role since 2019 in Steve Bannon and Brian Kolfage \\'s We Build the Wall scam, as an active member and a central figure in many of its fundraising efforts. [109] Persona .\nClarke frequently appears at public events on horseback wearing a cowboy hat. [42] He often wore 20 or more pins and badges on his uniform when in public, many not of official meaning or purpose, leading to accusations of \""stolen valor\"" (i.e., trying to create the image of heroic accomplishments). [110] [111] Electoral history .\nClarke married his wife Julie in 1996; she was a court clerk and later a real estate agent . They lived on the northwest side of Milwaukee. In 2018, Clarke filed for divorce from his wife. [34] .\n^ a b c d e f Kurt Chandler, The New Black Power , (July 25, 2003). ^ \""The New Black Power: A Profile of Sheriff David Clarke\"" .

(It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.).\n\""In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression.\"".\nSpecifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. It was signed on June 17, 1930, or seven and a half months after Wall Street\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""Black Tuesday\"" on Oct. 29, 1929.\nDouglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s , said there was \""no real reason\"" to impose the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and that it was mainly done for \""domestic political reasons.\"" In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists.\n\""Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression,\"" Irwin said, but he added that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fair to say it made the depression \""longer and more painful.\"".\nAfter the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports.\n\""Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump,\"" Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that \""if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country\\'s imports are another country\\'s exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time.\"".\nIndeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office.\nAs a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan.\n\""Economists today debate the tariffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small,\"" said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century .\nFor instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941 , said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade.\nStill, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression, the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said.\n\""It\\'s entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism,\"" said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II . \""However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression.\"".\nSasse said, \""We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been down this road before \\xe2\\x80\\x94 blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression.\"".\nWhile the downturn that became the Great Depression had been under way for about half a year by the time the United States passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, economists agree that the resulting trade war worsened the impact on both the global and domestic economy.\nSasse was cautious to say that the tariffs were \""a big part\"" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 rather than the only reason \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for the Great Depression.

Lee Wrote to The Times About Slavery in 1858 - The New York Times"", ""full_text"": ""One day in January, a few years before the Civil War, Robert E. Lee wrote to The New York Times, seeking a correction.\nThe man who would become the top Confederate general was trying to set the record straight about the slaves on his wife\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate in Virginia, and about the last wishes of a dying slave owner.\nHe wrote that the people enslaved on his family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property, in what was then known as Alexandria County, were not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeing sold South,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as had been reported. And he implied that he would free them within five years.\nThe letter is one of many written by Lee that sheds slivers of light on his thoughts about slavery. Historians have clashed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and are clashing still \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over the strength of his support for the system of forced labor that kept millions of people in bondage for generations.\nNow that statues of Lee and other Confederate leaders are the focus of an intensely heated national debate , the issue is an especially pertinent one.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was not a pro-slavery ideologue,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eric Foner, a Civil War historian, author and professor of history at Columbia University, said of Lee. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I think equally important is that, unlike some white southerners, he never spoke out against slavery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nWhen Lee wrote his letter to The Times, he was an accomplished United States Army officer acting as the executor of his father-in-law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will. His wife, Mary Anna Custis Lee, a descendant of Martha Washington, had recently inherited her father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate, Arlington House, along with the slaves who lived there.\nBut an article that was first published by The Boston Traveller and reprinted in The Times on Dec. 30, 1857, contended that the slaves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be consigned to hopeless Slavery unless something can be done\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because Mr. Custis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heirs did not want to free them.\nAn article published in The New York Times on Dec. 30, 1857, speculated that the emancipation of slaves at Arlington House was stalled because of \u201cfoul play.\u201d Robert E. Lee, who would become the top Confederate general during the Civil War, begged to differ. Credit... The New York Times.\nIt also said that Mr. Custis, while dying, told his slaves that they should be freed immediately, rather than five years on.\nLee challenged that account. In his letter to The Times, he said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is no desire on the part of the heirs to prevent the execution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the will. And he said Mr. Custis, who was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstantly attended\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by family members during his final days, had never been heard granting immediate freedom to his slaves.\nThe Times published Lee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter on Jan. 8, 1858 , (though the letter itself, written shortly after New Year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, appears to be mistakenly dated 1857) and said it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cglad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to be corrected on the matter.\nLee joined the secessionists in April 1861. He left Arlington House, and the estate was eventually overtaken by Union soldiers. (The dead were buried in its grounds, which would later become the site of Arlington National Cemetery.) Over the course of the conflict, many slaves were hired out or escaped the property.\nIn 1862, in accordance with Mr. Custis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will, Lee filed a deed of manumission to free the slaves at Arlington House and at two more plantations Mr. Custis had owned, individually naming more than 150 of them. And in January 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all people held as slaves in the rebelling states \\xe2\\x80\\x9care, and henceforward shall be free.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nOf all the letters by Lee that have been collected by archivists and historians over the years, one of the most famous was written to his wife in 1856. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote.\nBut he added that slavery was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca greater evil to the white man than to the black race\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the United States, and that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpainful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Va., was at the center of a violent rally this past weekend. Credit... Bryan McKenzie/The Daily Progress, via Associated Press.\nThe 1857 article in The Times noted that slaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own voices were missing from the story of Mr. Custis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dying wishes. It said that when he told his slaves they would be freed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno white man was in the room, and the testimony of negroes will not be taken in Court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBut years later, in 1866, one former slave at Arlington House, Wesley Norris, gave his testimony to the National Anti-Slavery Standard. Mr. Norris said that he and others at Arlington were indeed told by Mr. Custis they would be freed upon his death, but that Lee had told them to stay for five more years.\nSo Mr. Norris said he, a sister and a cousin tried to escape in 1859, but were caught. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were tied firmly to posts by a Mr. Gwin, our overseer, who was ordered by Gen. Lee to strip us to the waist and give us fifty lashes each, excepting my sister, who received but twenty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\nAnd when the overseer declined to wield the lash, a constable stepped up, Mr. Norris said. He added that Lee had told the constable to \\xe2\\x80\\x9clay it on well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nDr. Foner said that after the war, Lee did not support rights for black citizens, such as the right to vote, and was largely silent about violence perpetrated by white supremacists during Reconstruction.\nThe general did, however, object to the idea of raising Confederate monuments, writing in 1869 that it would be wiser \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d."", ""evidence"": ""The letter is one of many written by Lee that sheds slivers of light on his thoughts about slavery."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.99572915""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>CLAIM: Gen.

Lee, who led the Confederate States Army in the Civil War, \\xe2\\x80\\x9copposed both secession and slavery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He did not own slaves.\\xc2\\xa0.\nAP\\xe2\\x80\\x99S ASSESSMENT: False. According to historians, not only did Lee own slaves, but he also fought in court to keep working slaves from his father-in-law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate. Claims casting Lee as an anti-slavery figure are tied to a false narrative known as the Lost Cause, which says the Confederate experience in the Civil War was not about slavery, but state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights.\\xc2\\xa0.\nTHE FACTS:\\xc2\\xa0 As protests following the death of George Floyd lead to a reexamination of historical injustice, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a campaign calling for monuments celebrating the Confederacy to be taken down. False posts emerged on Facebook claiming that Lee \\xe2\\x80\\x9copposed both slavery and secession.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The false post was shared tens of thousands of times.\nFloyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck for several minutes as he struggled to breathe.\nJohn Reeves, a historian and author of the book, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee: The Forgotten Case Against an American Icon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the claim about Lee is false.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetween owning a handful of slaves from his own family and then managing his father-in-law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 200 slaves, Lee was very, very involved with slavery during his life up until the end of 1862,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\nReeves explained that Lee worked the slaves for about five years in order to pay off legacies associated with his father-in-law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was utilizing the slave labor in order to pay the legacies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reeves explained.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\nLee wanted to work the slaves beyond the five-year limit stated in his father-in-law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s will. Lee fought in court to keep the slaves working because he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if he would be able to pay off his legacies.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWesley Norris was born a slave on the plantation that Lee managed after his father-in-law died. Norris testified during the court fight that Lee beat him when he tried to run away. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery one of the facts in Wesley Norris\\xe2\\x80\\x99 account has been shown to be true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reeves noted.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe Lost Cause ideology imagines Lee as a gifted military general who wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fighting for slavery but was fighting for state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights.\\xc2\\xa0.\nDefenders of Lee point to a portion of a letter he wrote to his wife where he refers to slavery as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral & political evil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But it is taken out of context. In the rest of the letter, Lee underscores that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubjugation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the slaves needs to go on longer and only God can free them.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you judge him by his actions, he separated families through sale, he beat slaves who ran away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ariela Gross, professor of law and history at University of Southern California. Gross focuses on race and slavery in the United States. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was completely engaged in the work of slave holding and supporting slavery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0.\nThis is part of The Associated Press\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform."", ""evidence"": ""CLAIM: Gen.

Its ugly details challenge us. So does the painful paradox of a nation rooted in liberty, yet exercising daily oppression. If you add Lee to this mix, more conflicting emotions are awakened. He is a controversial figure, seen by some as a shameless traitor and by others as a beloved hero. His association with slavery has been characterized with similar partisanship, sometimes painting an image that is more fabled than factual. .\nSome people may ask why we should delve into this difficult topic. There are several reasons we ought to be interested. First, as students of history, our job is to try to establish as clearly as possible what happened in the past and how those events and attitudes affected our national development. This is particularly important when we are talking about figures such as Lee, whose image has largely been shaped by oral tradition. Since we are historians rather than folklorists, part of our task is to separate reality from legend. .\nLee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views on slavery are also central to his story because they influenced decisions that would have profound consequences for the United States. Slavery shaped his resolution to fight for the South. Lee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinions also served as a beacon for generations of Southerners as they struggled to comprehend the tragedy of the war.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook .).\nFirst, there is no record of Jarrett ever saying this, and no mention of the quote from any media organization over the last 40 years.The complete lack of scrutiny of such an inflammatory statement coming from someone who held a high-profile position in the White House for years suggests the quote is fabricated.\nNext, \\xc2\\xa0Jarrett was indeed born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1956. But she was born to American parents, Dr. James and Barbara Bowman. The family lived in the country for about six years because Jarrett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father became chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital.

A spurious quote attributed to White House adviser Valerie Jarrett was supposedly spoken during her time as an undergraduate at Stanford University.\nValerie Jarrett was offered a role as a White House Senior Advisor at the very beginning of the Obama administration in January 2009 and held the position of Senior Advisor to the President of the United States. President Obama said he consulted Jarrett on every major decision, and the New Republic \\'s Noam Scheiber reported thus of her influence with the White House:.\n\""Her role since she has been at the White House is one of the broadest and most expansive roles that I think has ever existed in the West Wing,\"" says Anita Dunn, Obama\\'s former communications director. Broader, even, than the role of running the West Wing. This summer, the call to send Attorney General Eric Holder on a risky visit to Ferguson, Missouri, was made by exactly three people: Holder himself, the president, and Jarrett, who were vacationing together on Martha\\'s Vineyard. When I asked Holder if Denis McDonough, the chief of staff, was part of the conversation, he thought for a moment and said, \""He was not there.\"".\nJarrett holds a key vote on Cabinet picks (she opposed Larry Summers at Treasury and was among the first Obama aides to come around on Hillary Clinton at State) and has an outsize say on ambassadorships and judgeships. She helps determine who gets invited to the First Lady\\'s Box for the State of the Union, who attends state dinners and bill-signing ceremonies, and who sits where at any of the above.\nThe level of influence Jarrett held with the Obama administration prompted many detractors to complain she wielded too much control over the President and decisions about who should have access to him, and one expression that detraction commonly took was the assertion that Jarrett was a foreign-born Islamic \""mole\"" who was pushing for (or furthering) a Muslim agenda through the executive branch.\nOne quote attributed to Jarrett is a typical example, holding that while she was an undergraduate psychology student at Stanford University in 1977, she proclaimed herself to be an Iranian who sought \""to help change America to be a more Islamic country\"" and she felt \""like it is going well in the transition of using freedom of religion in America against itself\"":.\nContrary to common rumor, however, neither Jarrett nor her parents are Iranian, nor (as far as we can tell) are any of them Muslim. Jarrett\\'s parents, James E. Bowman and Barbara Taylor Bowman, were both American-born U.S. citizens from Washington, D.C. and Chicago, respectively; the couple merely lived in Iran for about six years in the late 1950s and early 1960s while James served as chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz as part of a program that sent American physicians to work in developing countries.\nValerie was born in Shiraz during the Bowmans\\' sojourn in Iran; she returned to the U.S. with her parents in 1962 (when she was five years old), whereupon she attended prep school in Massachusetts, graduated with a B.A. in psychology from Stanford University in 1978, and earned a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School in 1981 before returning to Chicago to begin her working career. We\\'ve found no evidence Valerie Jarrett is (or ever was) Muslim, her only apparent connection to that religion being the incidental one that she temporarily lived in a predominantly Muslim country with her American parents for the first few years of her life.\nThe quote to attributed \""Valerie Jarrett, Stanford University, 1977\"" about her \""seek[ing] to help change America to be a more Islamic country\"" is an unfounded one that has no source other than recent repetition (primarily on right-wing web sites and blogs). It\\'s also an anachronism, as \""Valerie Jarrett\"" didn\\'t exist in 1977: she was born Valerie Bowman and didn\\'t take the latter surname until she married William Jarrett in 1983.\nMoreover, the wording of the meme in its commonly reproduced form was too stilted to be believable as the utterance of a fluent English speaker (e.g., \""I am an Iranian by birth and of [sic] my Islamic faith\""). Finally, no news article or document associated with Stanford University records Jarrett as having made this statement back in 1977; and if there were any credible evidence Jarrett had ever said anything remotely like this, it would have been a well-covered news story since shortly after the 2008 presidential election and not a obscure meme that didn\\'t pop up until several years later.\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Will Posting This Notice Stop Facebook or Instagram from Making Your Posts Public? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t."", ""evidence"": "" \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Did Valerie Jarrett Say She Wants to \\'Help Change America to Be a More Islamic Country\\'?"", ""nli_class"": ""entailment"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9877959""}]",0

All the states are hotspots of drug cartel activity, either hosting trafficking routes or extensive drug-crop cultivation.\nThe State Department had previously discouraged travel to all or part of those states but the new warnings are sterner, placing them on a level 4 warning, the highest level of potential danger.\nMexico as a whole has a level 2 rating , meaning Americans should \""exercise increased caution\"" because of concerns about crime. \""Violent crime, such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, is widespread,\"" a travel advisory dated January 10 says.\nBut an additional 11 Mexican states got a level 3 warning Wednesday, which urges people to \""reconsider travel\"" there. Mexico has 31 states, half of which are now under level 3 or 4 warnings. The Deadliest Assignment: Reporting in Mexico.\nThose states where Americans are urged to reconsider travel include the State of Mexico -- Mexico\\'s most populous state, which includes most suburbs of Mexico City -- and Jalisco, home to the city of Guadalajara, the Puerto Vallarta resorts and the lakeside expat community of Chapala and Ajijic. But the travel advisory said there are \""no restrictions on U.S. government employees for stays in ... Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, Chapala, and Ajijic.\"".\nMost of northern Mexico, including the border states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Sonora as well as Durango, Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi, are under level 3 warnings.\nMexico\\'s federal tourism department was not immediately available to comment on the new warnings. But the government\\'s Mexico Tourism Board said in a statement that \""Mexico\\'s major international tourism destinations have been explicitly listed as having no travel restrictions,\"" apparently a reference to major resorts like Cancun, Puerto Vallarta and Huatulco.\nHowever, at least two Mexican resorts -- Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo and Acapulco -- are in a do-not-travel state, Guerrero, and last year, the State Department extended a total ban on personal travel by U.S. government personnel there.\nU.S. personnel had previously been allowed to fly to Ixtapa, the last place in Guerrero where they had been allowed to go. Personal travel by land and to the resort city of Acapulco had already been prohibited.\nThe no-travel states had mostly already lost much foreign tourism. Tamaulipas has long been riven by turf wars between rival drug cartels, and Sinaloa is home to the cartel of the same name. Michoacan was so dominated by a drug cartel that vigilantes took up arms in 2013 to drive them out.\nPreliminary figures suggest Mexico saw a record number of murders last year, the BBC reports . The year that previously had the most homicides was 2011, when over 27,000 people were killed, according to official figures.\nColima has seen homicides skyrocket in recent years due to the growth of the Jalisco New Generation drug cartel, and the state now has Mexico\\'s highest homicide rate, with 83.3 killings per 100,000 residents, according to figures for the first 11 months of 2017.\nThe state with second-highest homicide rate -- 61.6 per 100,000 -- was Baja California Sur, home to the twin resorts of Los Cabos. The state conserved its level 2 advisory, \""exercise increased caution,\"" despite a series of shootouts and killings in recent months.\nRising levels of violence have not so far affected Los Cabos, which saw a 16 percent increase in tourism arrivals and an 18 percent rise in hotel occupancy in 2017, said Rodrigo Esponda, managing director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board.\nEsponda said local officials and tourism operators are investing in increased security, including camera systems and the construction of a new marine base.\n\""We are going to keep working very hard in 2018 to make sure that Los Cabos continues as a safe destination,\"" Esponda said.\nSpeaking to local media earlier this week, Tourism Secretary Enrique De la Madrid said, \""In my opinion, the most important challenge we have in the tourism sector are crime events occurring where they didn\\'t before, for example in Cancun, la Paz and Los Cabos.\"".\nCopyright \u00a92023 CBS Interactive Inc.

In an oddity created by the new boundaries, two of the primary candidates are incumbents now fighting for the same seat.\nThroughout the debate, Rep. George Holding attempted to paint himself as a staunch conservative who won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t budge on controversial issues. Rep.

Subscribe .\n Career 8 Warning Signs That Your Supervisor Is Incompetent Characteristics of bad bosses, and what a good one should look like. .\nWe have all had bad bosses, but how do we know if our supervisor is really a bad one? Here are eight warning signs that your boss can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do the job, along with ideas about what a great supervisor should look like. .\n1. Never Has Time for You . Is your supervisor \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctoo busy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to meet, even when it is important, or does he or she cancel when a meeting has been scheduled? Good supervision means being responsive to supervisees\\xe2\\x80\\x94giving them the time they need to get information, understand assignments, and especially receive clear feedback. .\n2. Micromanages . Does your supervisor insist on checking every bit of your work? Does he or she over-control so much that you think, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you just do this yourself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The very best managers know how to empower subordinates to help them take on responsibility, show some initiative, and grow and learn on the job. .\n3. Is Untrustworthy. Are you afraid to be open and honest with your supervisor because he or she might use the information against you? Does your supervisor say one thing and do another? Good supervisor-supervisee relationships are built on trust. .\n4. Puts Me First, You Last. Does your supervisor spend all of his or her time on their own career , and show no interest in your advancement? The very best bosses take a genuine interest in their employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 career growth and development. Truly great leaders are like good parents. They take pride in the accomplishments of those they supervise. .\n5. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Manage the Workload. Is your boss incapable of handling his or her own supervisory workload? Are decisions and assignments always made late, or not at all? Great supervisors make sure that they can manage their own workload and also spend the time necessary to effectively manage and lead their direct reports. .\n6. Focuses Exclusively on the Negative. Is your boss always pointing out what you are doing wrong, and ignoring what you do correctly? Does every speech from your boss take a negative tone of \""what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong?\"" The best bosses focus primarily on the positive (and keep a motivating, positive attitude and outlook). .\n7. Thinks Punishment is Motivating. Are you always looking over your shoulder waiting for the boss to lower the boom? Punitive management is always a bad idea. It de-motivates people and gets them to focus on avoiding mistakes rather than getting good things done. And, punishment is a major, debilitating stressor for employees. .\n8. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Communicate Clearly. Is it difficult to determine what your boss really wants? Do you find that your boss rarely listens to you? Effective communication is the key to good management. Giving clear directions and listening to subordinates are crucial to success at work. .\nThere is an old saying that people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quit their jobs, they quit their bosses. While that may not always be the case, in many instances the supervisor is responsible for making the job a good one. Good managers make jobs interesting and rewarding, and they work hard to make their supervisees better. .\nCities: Atlanta, GA Austin, TX Baltimore, MD Boston, MA Brooklyn, NY Charlotte, NC Chicago, IL Columbus, OH Dallas, TX Denver, CO Detroit, MI Houston, TX Indianapolis, IN Jacksonville, FL Las Vegas, NV Los Angeles, CA Louisville, KY Memphis, TN Miami, FL Milwaukee, WI Minneapolis, MN Nashville, TN New York, NY Oakland, CA Omaha, NE Philadelphia, PA Phoenix, AZ Pittsburgh, PA Portland, OR Raleigh, NC Sacramento, CA Saint Louis, MO San Antonio, TX San Diego, CA San Francisco, CA San Jose, CA Seattle, WA Tucson, AZ Washington, DC .\n More recent developments in leadership include a greater focus on the role of the follower and recognition of leadership\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complexity. .\n Growth and aliveness require a commitment not only to just learning but also to unlearning\\xe2\\x80\\x94letting go of behaviors that no longer work. .\n Sometimes early warnings of potential marital friction are there all along, in the form of personality conflicts or day-to-day incompatibility. .\n Get Help Find a Therapist Find a Treatment Center Find a Psychiatrist Find a Support Group Find Teletherapy Members Login Sign Up United States Austin, TX Brooklyn, NY Chicago, IL Denver, CO Houston, TX Los Angeles, CA New York, NY Portland, OR San Diego, CA San Francisco, CA Seattle, WA Washington, DC .\n Men have long been silent and stoic about their inner lives, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s every reason for them to open up emotionally\\xe2\\x80\\x94and their partners are helping.

(AP) .\n\u2022 The discussion inspired us to turn to historians to find out what U.S.-Nazi Germany relations were actually like in the run-up to World War II. \\xe2\\x80\\x8b .\nDuring the final 2020 presidential debate, President Donald Trump boasted that he had eased tensions on the Korean Peninsula by maintaining a good relationship with the nation\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un.\n\""North Korea, we\u2019re not in a war, we have a good relationship,\"" Trump said . \""You know, people don\u2019t understand \u2014 having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\"".\nThe first three words are hard to hear as the moderator and Trump talk over Biden. But the confusing moment generated plenty of discourse by people who riffed off of what they thought they heard Biden say.\nOn Facebook, a website called TheConservativeOpinion.com put the latter part of Biden\u2019s comment as a headline in a similar way: \""Biden claims \u2018we had a good relationship with Hitler before he invaded the rest of Europe.\u2019\"" The story included a similarly worded tweet from CBS News.\nIn context, Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, was making a sarcastic analogy about the danger of maintaining good relationships with dictators. He was posing a hypothetical by suggesting Trump was wrong to want to have a good relationship with Kim, just like it would have been wrong to want to have a good relationship with Adolf Hitler, the German dictator and leader of the Nazi Party.\nBut even an NBC News debate night blog that noted Biden intended sarcasm omitted the words \""That\u2019s like saying,\"" when quoting the former vice president.\nWe see no indication Biden was speaking literally. But the discussion inspired us to turn to historians to find out what U.S.-Nazi Germany relations were actually like before the two powers had declared war on each other.\nThey told us that the United States\u2019 relationship with Hitler in the run-up to the invasion of Europe was complex and difficult to characterize in either good or bad terms.\nAccording to Paul Kennedy, a Yale professor of history and international security studies, the U.S. and Nazi Germany had a formal relationship of neutrality, even up until Hitler\u2019s declaration of war on the U.S. in December 1941.\n\""We were technically \u2018appeasers,\u2019 like Chamberlain, Stalin, Canada for a very long while,\"" Kennedy wrote in an email. \""It\u2019s a complicated story.\"".\nHitler and U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt both came to power in 1933. Roosevelt and members of his inner circle loathed the Nazis, Kennedy said. Nevertheless, they shied away from overtly supporting Britain and France to avoid antagonizing Americans who wanted the country to stay abreast of European conflicts after the ravages of World War I and the Great Depression.\nMax Paul Friedman, a professor of history and international relations at American University, said that it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that relations between Nazi Germany and the U.S. were \""good,\"" because Roosevelt did take steps to chastise Germany even before the invasion of Europe.\nIn October 1937, Roosevelt gave the so-called \"" Quarantine Speech ,\"" calling for the isolation of aggressor nations. Even though Roosevelt did not name who these aggressors were, it was widely interpreted that he was referring in part to Germany. In response to the state-sponsored pogrom against Jews known as Kristallnacht, Roosevelt expressed his shock and recalled U.S. ambassador Hugh Wilson from Berlin.\nHowever, Friedman wrote, \""some Americans\u2026had good relations with Hitler before the war, including some with pro-Nazi leanings who joined the isolationist movement known as America First.\"".\nAfter Hitler invaded the rest of Europe, relations between the two countries worsened, leading to a state of undeclared naval conflict by the time the U.S. officially entered World War II in December 1941.\u00a0\\xe2\\x80\\x8b .\n Department of Homeland Security \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeemed as terrorism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d behavior that includes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresisting COVID regulations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking the election was rigged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d...\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn other words, if you are a Trump supporter, you are a terrorist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis \\xe2\\x80\\x98infrastructure bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on page 2,385 presents a federal property tax of 3 percent on all homes and land - both residential and commercial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Norway decided \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat (the coronavirus) should be treated like other respiratory diseases, such as the flu or cold, because\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 it is no more dangerous than those mentioned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n News cameras \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshut off\\xe2\\x80\\x9d just as Biden was asked if he gave the Taliban a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chit list\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of evacuating American and Afghan officials. .\n A leaked email from a Liberal Party politician shows the Canadian government\\'s plan to \\xe2\\x80\\x9creset\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the economy and seize private property. .\n When discussing education savings accounts, \""We would be 31st in the nation to have these policies going forward on behalf of kids.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n At a Wisconsin school, a 12-year-old girl \""was transitioned into a boy by school officials without parental consent,\"" and Protasiewicz supports it. ."", ""evidence"": "" Department of Homeland Security \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeemed as terrorism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d behavior that includes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresisting COVID regulations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking the election was rigged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d...\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn other words, if you are a Trump supporter, you are a terrorist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ."", ""nli_class"": ""entailment"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.998413""}, {""snippet"": ""<b> Department of Homeland Security \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeemed as terrorism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d behavior that includes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresisting COVID regulations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking the election was rigged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d...\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn other words, if you are a Trump supporter, you are a terrorist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/01/ask-politifact-why-did-hunter-biden-leave-navy/"", ""title"": ""PolitiFact | Ask PolitiFact: Why did Hunter Biden leave the Navy?"", ""full_text"": "" Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy. We need your help. .\nIn one of the most contentious exchanges of the first 2020 presidential debate, President Donald Trump interrupted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as he spoke of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and died of brain cancer in 2015.\n\""I don\u2019t know Beau. I know Hunter,\"" Trump interjected, before invoking Hunter Biden\u2019s issues with substance abuse. \""Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"".\nThe exchange confused some of our readers, who were wondering which of the two candidates to believe. \""I was hoping to see something about whether Biden's son received a dishonorable discharge from the military,\"" one reader emailed us. \""They said opposite things, and it maligned someone's reputation, perhaps unjustly.\"".\nHunter Biden was pushed out of the military after testing positive for cocaine. The best reporting into the circumstances of that discharge indicate that his discharge was administrative, however, not dishonorable. Biden was 44 at the time and serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve.\nHunter Biden revealed in a 2014 statement to the Wall Street Journal that he had been administratively discharged, saying it was \""the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge.\"".\nDishonorable discharges are reserved for service members who have engaged in what the military considers the most reprehensible conduct. This discharge is handed down to servicemembers who have been convicted by court-martial for a serious offense like desertion, sexual assault, or murder.\nA dishonorably discharged veteran faces severe penalties, losing the right to any veterans\u2019 benefits and the right to own firearms. In most cases, dishonorably discharged veterans cannot vote, obtain bank loans or college grants, work at the state or federal level, or receive government assistance of any kind. Experts say the social stigma attached to a dishonorable discharge often makes it difficult to obtain employment after service.\nAdministrative discharges are handed down for transgressions the military deems less serious, like \u2014 in Hunter Biden\u2019s case \u2014 failing a drug test. Biden could have received one of two types of administrative discharges: general (under honorable conditions) and other than honorable. Veterans with general administrative discharges still receive hiring preference for civil service jobs but are not eligible for GI Bill benefits. Veterans with other-than-honorable discharges receive neither.\nPhilip D. Cave, a military law specialist who has represented many discharged service members, said that commanding officers often have latitude in determining which administrative discharge to hand down to service members who test positive for drugs.\nCave said his best understanding of how drug offenses are treated would lead him to guess that Biden\u2019s offense, if it involved cocaine, would probably qualify him for an other-than-honorable discharge.\nHunter Biden, now 50, is the former vice president\u2019s youngest son.

In an interview on NBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Biden said he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advise his family to fly on planes or ride the subway. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go anywhere in confined places right now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Biden said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to Mexico, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that you are in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes, it goes everywhere through the aircraft.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nAirlines angrily accused Biden of fearmongering. Media reports noted that Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pessimism contrasted sharply with the reassurances President Barack Obama had given a day earlier, when he said there was no need to panic even as he declared a national health emergency. In a matter of hours, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew were summoned to the White House and assigned to clean up the mess Biden made: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNip it in the bud,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d LaHood said, recalling their instructions. .\nThe snafu was the first of many scrambles and setbacks by the Obama administration in its initial response to the swine flu. POLITICO interviewed almost two dozen people, including administration officials, members of Congress and outsiders who contended with the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response, and they described a litany of sadly familiar obstacles: vaccine shortfalls, fights over funding and sometimes contradictory messaging. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is purely a fortuity that this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one of the great mass casualty events in American history,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ron Klain, who was Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief of staff at the time, said of H1N1 in 2019. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck. If anyone thinks that this can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen again, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to go back to 1918, they just have to go back to 2009, 2010 and imagine a virus with a different lethality, and you can just do the math on that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 13: Ebola Response Coordinator Ron Klain (L), joined by U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden (R), speaks during a meeting regarding Ebola at the Eisenhower Executive office building November 13, 2014 in Washington, D.C. Vice President Biden met with leaders of faith, humanitarian, and non-governmental organizations that are responding to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) | Mark Wilson/Getty Images .\nOver the course of a year, the H1N1 flu infected 60 million Americans, but claimed only 12,469 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. .\nKlain now says his comments, which were made at a biosecurity summit, referred solely to the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficulties in producing enough of an H1N1 vaccine to meet public demand. The Obama team, he says, quickly adapted to the situation, making choices that were starkly different from those the Trump administration would make 11 years later, such as quickly distributing emergency equipment from the federal stockpile, deferring to public health experts and having them take the lead on messaging. .\nNow, as Biden prepares to take on President Donald Trump in a presidential election marked by a far more lethal pandemic, Klain and other Biden intimates have seized on the idea that the former vice president is the man for this moment. Having played pivotal roles in the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to H1N1 and Ebola, Biden himself has insisted he is uniquely equipped to confront the coronavirus pandemic. Obama, too, lauded Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contributions. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJoe helped me manage H1N1 and prevent the Ebola epidemic from becoming the type of pandemic we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama said in endorsing Biden. .\nBut an extensive review of the handling of H1N1, including the examination of public records and congressional testimony, suggests the response was not the panacea portrayed by the Biden camp and its defenders: Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role, while significant, was not equivalent to leading the response. He was the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main liaison to governors and Congress and succeeded in securing funding from skeptical leaders. Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt at messaging, via the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interview, proved that he, at least, took the threat of a pandemic very seriously. But by issuing warnings that others in the administration weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prepared to endorse, he contributed to a muddled message. .\nBiden declined to comment, but former officials described a White House, still in its infancy, bogged down by seismic economic challenges and struggling to keep its signature promise for a universal health care plan. With a Health and Human Services Department still bereft of more than a dozen officials \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the Cabinet secretary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Obama team now had a fast-moving pandemic with unknown lethality bearing down on them. .\nAfter an initial run of problems \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including an inability to contain the virus and slower-than-expected development of a vaccine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they say they learned quickly and generated a better response both in the later stages of H1N1 and then, five years later, in confronting the much more lethal Ebola virus. .\nThey listened to the scientists. They got Congress on board. They put experts out in front of the public. And they righted messaging, adopting an acronym that would serve as a linchpin in averting future snafus: PTFOTV \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Put Tony Fauci on TV. A Killer of Children .\nH1N1 entered the U.S. population at the opposite end of the age spectrum as the novel coronavirus: The most vulnerable people were under 30, a realization that would come to worry parents across the country. .\nIn one CDC study, children between the ages of 5 and 14 were found to be 14 times more likely to be infected than those 60 or older. .\nThe first case emerged on April 15, when a 10-year-old in California tested positive for a virus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunknown to humans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to a CDC analysis. Two days later, an 8-year-old in another part of California tested positive for the same virus. The two children had no known contact. .\nWhile the CDC began to assess the significance of this development, Obama was in Mexico making a ritual courtesy call on then-President Felipe Calder\\xc3\\xb3n. Brennan was part of Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entourage. At one point, Obama, Brennan and others in the visiting party went to Mexico City\\xe2\\x80\\x99s famed anthropological museum for a private tour by the director. .\nA week later, the museum director, Felipe Solis, died of flu-like symptoms. While his ailment was initially thought to be H1N1, doctors later surmised that he had suffered from an unrelated form of pneumonia. But the notion that a famous man who had just spent hours with the president might have carried the mystery virus served to underscore its risks. .\nThe CDC quickly began trying to replicate the virus in a way that would lead to a vaccine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a process that was far more advanced for flu than coronaviruses. On April 25, just a few days after Brennan gave his Oval Office briefing to Obama and Biden, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency. A day later, Obama did the same, triggering a release of supplies from the national stockpile, including antiviral drugs, personal protective equipment and respirators. On April 28, two days after Obama declared the emergency, the FDA approved an H1N1 test. .\n FILE - In this April 10, 2014 file photo, then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius listens while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington.

The future of the Affordable Care Act hinges on the outcome of the presidential election, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shaping up as a moment of truth for Republicans. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) | Susan Walsh, File/AP Photo .\nThe 60-year-old Sebelius had won the job after Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first pick, former Sen. Tom Daschle, withdrew from consideration in early February because of tax issues. A former governor of Kansas, Sebelius believed her first challenge would be to dramatically expand health insurance coverage, a task that would require both political armor and acumen. .\nBut after her Senate confirmation, Sebelius was escorted into the White House Situation Room, where Brennan and White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel awaited her. They had a more immediate challenge in mind: defeating H1N1. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about health care legislation, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about anything [else],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Emanuel said he told Sebelius. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is target number one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBrennan and Emanuel stressed to Sebelius that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe got to get our hands around\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the severity of the virus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto minimize the public health threat and a potential loss of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to Emanuel. .\nObama and Biden were at a White House news event celebrating the decision by Pennsylvania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republican senator, Arlen Specter, to switch parties. Before joining Biden in heaping praise on Specter, the president turned to the H1N1 issue. .\nObama announced that he had requested $1.5 billion in emergency funding, saying it would \\xe2\\x80\\x9censure that we have adequate supplies of vaccines and the equipment to handle a potential outbreak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had already urged schools to consider closing if they had confirmed or suspected cases of H1N1. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can assure you that we will be vigilant in monitoring the progress of this flu,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I will make every judgment based on the best science available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nObama, seeking to learn from his predecessors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experiences, invited members of the Ford administration to visit the White House and discuss their own fateful dance with the swine flu in 1976, when a variant of H1N1 broke out on a U.S. military base and President Gerald Ford ordered a nationwide vaccination program. .\nInside the Roosevelt Room, a windowless expanse with a large conference table for meetings, F. David Mathews, Ford\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health secretary, and William Taft IV, who had served as general counsel for the health department, held forth. Taft, the great-grandson of the 27th president, said he told Obama it was important to get Congress on board early \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand to keep them on board, because that had been very helpful to us in \\xe2\\x80\\x9976.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nMathews offered additional advice: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen people get sick, they want to talk to the doctor. Let the health people take the lead in this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mathews said he told Obama. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou be supportive, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got good doctors, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a good system here, rely on them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nMathews and Taft were so fixated on the new president that they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember whether the new vice president, who was already a familiar Washington hand in the Ford days, attended the meeting. But Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four decades of contacts would prove useful in implementing Taft\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice to get Congress on board. .\nObama faced a deceptively difficult struggle with Congress. Few in the House or Senate understood the dangers of pandemics. Democratic leaders, having finished a massive stimulus two months earlier, were setting their sights on priorities like health care reform and reducing carbon emissions. Republicans, meanwhile, were massing in opposition to the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spending plans, feeling bruised by what they saw as Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt to cram unrelated Democratic priorities into the stimulus bill, which was supposed to provide a short-term jolt to the economy. .\nEven after his comments on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d blew up, Biden remained attentive to the H1N1 issue, attending almost all the briefings for Obama and other top officials, Brennan recalled. .\nOne aide involved in the H1N1 response said even if Biden wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t present at meetings, his interests were made known. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was often: \\xe2\\x80\\x98The vice president wants to know X, Y or Z,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the aide said. .\nBut as usual, the affable Biden was most active behind the scenes, serving as Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambassador to political leaders across the country. Governors were particularly apprehensive about H1N1 as they began looking ahead to a new school year a few months hence. Klain recalls that Sebelius would refer local officials who were impatient or frustrated with some aspect of the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to Biden for a pep talk. .\nIndeed, the vice president was on the horn every time a local bigwig needed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspeak to someone important at the White House,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said. Biden was proactive as well, delivering an H1N1 briefing to a conference of governors at which he took questions and offered guidance from the CDC. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was scary, I think a lot of people were apprehensive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, who recalled Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s briefing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was the kind of the guy, you tell him what you need and he was very receptive, personable. He was always available. If you needed something you could always call him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was the kind of the guy, you tell him what you need and he was very receptive, personable. He was always available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nFauci, who had been the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infectious disease chief since the Reagan administration, predicted a dangerous surge in infections once school was back in session, necessitating more money for vaccines, medical supplies and overall preparedness. .\nObama asked Biden, who already served as the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unofficial liaison to the Senate, to meet with congressional leaders to lobby for nearly $9 billion. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuring the meeting, something came up, someone tapped Obama on his shoulder and he had to leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d recalled then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBiden wound up running the meeting and making the case for more money. From that point forward, he basically took over on the swine flu deal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBiden laid out the potential dangers ahead, stressing the need to quickly ramp up on vaccine development, according to an aide in the room at the time. Democrats were receptive. Republican opposition had played a role in blocking the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request for pandemic funding in the stimulus bill, before H1N1 even appeared. Now, with children vulnerable to infection, that opposition melted away. .\nEven as federal money was flowing into vaccine development, government scientists were starting to see a problem: The H1N1 virus was taking longer to grow in eggs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the method of producing a mutated version of the virus for a vaccine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 than the seasonal flu. .\nThat meant there would be a lag in preparing the seed stocks of virus that manufacturers needed to start production. But the Obama administration made a significant mistake: Sebelius\\xe2\\x80\\x99 team at HHS nonetheless announced that if all went as planned, they should have 100 million doses ready for use by mid-October. That was consistent with promises made by the vaccine manufacturers, who had actually contracted for 120 million doses by October, but before the delays in the seed stocks. .\nThe slowness in growing the virus needed for the vaccine was compounded by a range of additional setbacks, including repeated glitches in manufacturing the drug. .\nThere were also mistakes in establishing a proper dose, with an initial protocol calling for two rounds of the vaccine. It turned out that was recommended only for children 10 and younger. .\nSebelius declined to comment, but Nicole Lurie, who served as HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said there were two components to the delay: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne was, the vaccine rolled out slowly because of some production issues. Stuff always goes wrong. The other, people wanted it faster than they could get it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIndeed, flu season was approaching, and local officials \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not to mention parents who were sending their children to crowded classrooms \\xe2\\x80\\x94 demanded protection. .\n FILE - In this Nov. 9, 2009, file photo, a package of the H1N1 swine flu vaccine is shown at a pharmacy in Seattle. Last fall, as swine flu cases mounted and parents desperately sought to protect their kids, the hard-to-get vaccine was handed out in some surprising places: the Royal Caribbean cruise line, the headquarters of drug giant Merck, the Johnson Space Center, and a Department of Energy office in Idaho. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, file) | Ted S. Warren, file/AP Photo .\nBy mid-October, however, when the demand for the vaccine was at its highest, supply fell dramatically short, with as few as 11 million doses on hand, according to one report . .\nAt this point, about 22 million Americans had been infected with H1N1, 540 children had died and 36,000 children had been hospitalized, according to CDC estimates at the time . .\nCompounding the supply setbacks was the form of the initial vaccination shipments: Almost all of it was nasal spray, which could not be used by some in the highest-risk groups, like children with asthma and pregnant women. .\nWhen reports circulated of an impending shortage of supply, demand soared. Parents rushed their children to doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offices. Soon, lines for the vaccine stretched for blocks in cities across the country, including Los Angeles and New York. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were long lines,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lurie said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf there is a shortage of something, it seems people really want it. Once it was widely available, there was less interest. That was one of those things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nState health officials and doctors grew exasperated as their orders failed to come in on time. California, for instance, reported that by November it had received only half the number of vaccines it had ordered and feared it couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cover even vulnerable populations. .\nPerpetuating the shortages were states like New York, which required all of its health workers to receive the shots. As the supplies lagged, however, New York lifted the requirement. .\nOn Oct. 23, CDC Director Tom Frieden apologized for the snafus: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we have learned more in the last couple of weeks is that not only is the virus unpredictable, but vaccine production is much less predictable than we wish. We are nowhere near where we thought we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be by now. We are not near where the vaccine manufacturers predicted we would be. We share the frustration of people who have waited on line or called a number or checked a website and haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to find a place to get vaccinated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nEventually, the U.S. was swamped with the H1N1 vaccine. But most of it arrived after flu season had peaked and demand had died down. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had great scientists working on the vaccine. We had all kinds of people working on logistics. But in the end, the vaccine did not arrive in time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe vast majority of H1N1 cases we had in America happened before the vaccine was available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTestifying before a congressional panel in November 2009, Fauci acknowledged the administration had created false expectations, but he blamed the surprising slowness of the virus growth. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe had great scientists working on the vaccine. We had all kinds of people working on logistics. But in the end, the vaccine did not arrive in time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe drug companies in good faith contracted with the government to get a certain amount of doses for the flu season,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fauci said during a Nov. 4, 2009, congressional hearing at which officials were asked to explain vaccine shortages. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith that comes benchmarks when you think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be delivered. The fact that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not has to do with what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said over and over again \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that the virus doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grow very well. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the nature of the biology of the virus that created an expectation that we thought there would be a certain amount, that expectation was shared with the American public and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disappointment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBy Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second term, the H1N1 crisis was a distant memory. Klain had left the White House in 2011 to take a job at Case Holdings, advising AOL founder Steve Case on his business and charitable interests. But then, in 2014, the specter of a pandemic loomed again. .\nEbola, a deadly virus spread from bats to humans, appeared in West Africa. Far less infectious than H1N1, Ebola was believed to be spread through bodily fluids. It was also, however, far more deadly than H1N1. In the United States, fears grew when a Dallas man who had recently worked in Liberia died of the virus in early October and two nurses who treated him became infected. Obama, already battling low favorability ratings, was facing a firestorm of criticism over his handling of Ebola. .\nAt that point, with most of the infections still in Africa, Obama tapped Klain to become his Ebola czar, managing both the public health response and the diplomatic challenge in making sure foreign governments did enough to contain the virus within their boundaries. .\nShortly after returning to the White House, Klain found himself breaking delicate news to Obama. A doctor named Craig Spencer, who had volunteered to treat Ebola patients in the African nation of Guinea, had tested positive for the disease in New York City. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is going to be the test,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said he told Obama at the time. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was going to be a show-me moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe test, in Klain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view, related neither to public health nor diplomacy. Trump, the New York businessman, had emerged as a leading political provocateur, building a following by demanding ever-greater evidence that Obama had been born in Hawaii, not Kenya, as Trump claimed. Now, Ebola was striking Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hometown, and he had a fresh occasion to demand a travel ban on nations where the disease was present. He fanned the flames just as the Obama administration was trying to tamp down panic and reassure the public. .\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand extended to doctors and medical workers: If they chose to go to those countries to treat patients, he argued, they shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to return. .\n President Donald Trump speaks at Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Tuesday, June 11, 2019. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo .\nOn Aug. 1, he tweeted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back. People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The next day, he wrote: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our \\xe2\\x80\\x98borders.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Act fast!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And on Aug. 8, he tweeted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSame CDC which is bringing Ebola to US misplaced samples of anthrax earlier this year\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Be careful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nFor months, in the run-up to the 2014 midterms, Trump didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let up. In October, he went after Obama personally. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mental health. Why won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he stop the flights. Psycho!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nKlain recalls that Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attacks were effective: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lot of the fears that gripped this country, specifically in October and November in 2014, were stirred up by Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweets. If we were able to successfully isolate and treat Dr. Spencer and no one got sick in that process, and the disease did not transmit in New York, this, more than anything else, would put an end to the Trump messaging on it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTo keep Ebola from spreading further beyond Africa, the administration, which already had dispatched 3,000 troops to West Africa to help contain the spread, had to send public health workers to the affected countries via commercial airlines. This would not be dangerous unless a person was exposed to the blood or other bodily fluids of an Ebola victim. But pilots, passengers, airport workers and others in American cities from which the workers came and went had to be put at ease about the possible spread of the contagion. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone in my office knew what PTFOTV stood for: Put Tony Fauci on TV,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe just had someone the president and vice president trusted deeply, we knew he was a communicator that the American people trusted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nFauci was dispatched to cable news shows. Employing another lesson of the H1N1 days, Klain recruited the CDC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Frieden to join him in briefings to add medical credibility to the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions. .\n National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci attends a meeting with President Donald Trump and pharmaceutical executives on the coronavirus in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Monday, March 2, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo .\nBiden, Klain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mentor, played an even larger role in Ebola than in H1N1, using his personal persuasion to reassure pilots and airline workers, Klain recalls. Biden also worked with governors in five states where airports were regularly used to transport U.S. personnel and equipment to Ebola-stricken countries. .\nOnce again, Biden served as a conduit to Congress, helping push through $5.4 billion in emergency funds. This was a tougher task than during H1N1. The House was under Republican control, and much of the Ebola money was heading overseas, to help contain the virus in Africa. .\nLisa Monaco, who served as Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, remembered a notable exchange between Biden and then-Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan when the African leader visited the White House during the Ebola outbreak. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe vice president was quite forceful with him to accelerate [his] response,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Monaco said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe message was: \\xe2\\x80\\x98We need you and your government to really step up and do more on detection, surveillance and tracing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nEventually, Dr. Spencer recovered and Ebola did not spread further in the United States. Medical volunteers who had been infected in Africa were allowed back in, and safely treated in U.S. hospitals without further spread. Klain and the rest of the Obama team considered the containment of Ebola to be a sharp rebuke to Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideas. .\nAs he faces daily criticism of his response to the coronavirus \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the most severe pandemic in a century \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump has tried to turn the spotlight on the Obama-Biden administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handling of the swine flu. .\nOn March 12, when there were only about 40 recorded coronavirus deaths in the United States, Trump tweeted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nFact-checkers disputed Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions , noting that the two polls measuring public approval of the Obama team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to H1N1 had averaged a fairly robust 67 percent. .\nBut the day after his initial tweet, Trump amplified the claims, stating again on Twitter: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTheir response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nSeven weeks later, Trump continues to face criticism for unkept promises about the level of testing and his overly optimistic projections about the rate of infections and deaths, while Democrats claim Obama and Biden were quicker to grasp the seriousness of the pandemic and mobilize the national stockpile and widespread testing. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat really happened was that in the end in the course of a year 14,000 Americans died from H1N1, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing every week from Covid,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Klain said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe did prepare for H1N1, we did execute a response from H1N1. That response included much more rapid testing than what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re seeing with Covid and a much more accelerated, professional and medical-based response.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nDespite Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions, few close observers of Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to H1N1 consider it a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull scale disaster.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Biden, despite his early messaging problems, played a role in mobilizing the administration and ensuring enough resources were devoted to defeating the pandemic. .\nBut the difficulties in mounting an effective response to H1N1, most officials agree, still stand as a cautionary tale for future administrations: Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, should he ever confront such a situation again. .\n White House Centers For Disease Control Ebola Barack Obama Joe Biden Joe Biden 2020 H1N1 Obama Administration Donald Trump Donald Trump 2020 Ron Klain Anthony Fauci Vaccination Coronavirus Pandemic .\n About Us Advertising Breaking News Alerts Careers Credit Card Payments Digital Edition FAQ Feedback Headlines Photos POWERJobs Press Print Subscriptions Request A Correction Write For Us RSS Site Map Terms of Service Privacy Policy Do not sell my info Notice to California Residents."", ""evidence"": ""Over the course of a year, the H1N1 flu infected 60 million Americans, but claimed only 12,469 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9551635""}, {""snippet ...evidence too long",0

Ted Lieu took to Twitter to point out how pretrial detention affects the poor.\n\""Dear @AlanDersh: I hope you will work with us on bail reform. Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they\\'ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don\\'t have high powered attorneys,\"" Lieu tweeted.\nDear @AlanDersh : I hope you will work with us on bail reform.

Call me at 202 225 3976. Let\\'s reform bail. https://t.co/mxVAsJ5qRj June 17, 2018 .\nVarious media outlets and experts in the field have referred to a figure of 450,000 Americans when discussing the scope of the problems with bail. However, we wanted to figure out where Lieu got his numbers from, so we did some digging of our own.\nUltimately, we found that the number in Lieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet is an overestimate of the number of Americans who are in jail because they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to pay bail. In addition, the statistic Lieu is referring to is not one that is kept nationally.\nIn other words, no accurate count exists of the amount of people in jail in America who are too poor to pay bail, so there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way to fully verify Lieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim.\nWe reached out to Lieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office and asked where they got the number of 450,000 Americans from. As evidence, Jenna Bushnell, Lieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s communication director, cited a Marshall Project article and Bureau of Justice Statistics report , the latter of which discloses that there were 458,600 unconvicted inmates in local jails at the end of 2016.\nIn his tweet, Lieu equates the Americans who \""are in jail not because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail\"" with the 458,600 count from the BJS report.\nHowever, the BJS statistic is a count of the total number of Americans who were detained and held in jail before their trials. That count includes those who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to pay bail, but it also includes other groups of people who are in jail before trial for different reasons. Included within that \""over 450,000\"" statistic are people who are not bailable, like those being held without any bail, meaning that no amount of money paid would result in their release. \\xc2\\xa0.\nIn other words, Lieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet is an overestimation of the number of Americans who are too poor to bail their way out of jail. \\xc2\\xa0.\n The 2020 election could not have been fair because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLos Angeles County agreed, during litigation, that there were 1.2 million ineligible voters after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n\""The unconvicted population in jails can also include mentally-ill persons awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility,\"" Darren Hutchinson, a University of Florida professor, told us.\nLauryn Gouldin, an Associate Professor of Law at Syracuse University, said that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also important to distinguish between judges who make informed, intentional decisions about setting high bails, and judges who are more careless in their decisions.\n\""Judges setting bail may be oblivious to the financial circumstances of those who end up detained (so is it ignorance/judicial accident that leads to detention) or judges may deliberately set high bails to assure detention for those they believe are high public safety/flight risks,\"" Gouldin said.\nBecause the BJS data only distinguishes \""convicted\"" from \""unconvicted\"" members of the jail population, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way Lieu would know the exact number of how many people are in jail because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re too poor to pay bail.\nAlthough the data on how many people can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to pay bail is scarce, the experts we spoke to pointed to some resources that were the best data available.\nGouldin cited a Vera Institute of Justice study that said nine out of 10 felony defendants are unable to afford the bail amount set by the judge.\nMeanwhile, Insha Rahman, a program director at the Vera Institute of Justice, pointed to two studies that locally analyzed how many people were being detained pretrial due to an inability to pay bail.\nIn all three studies, a majority of the pretrial detainees were in jail because they could not afford to pay their bail. However, both Gouldin and Rahman cautioned against generalizing the results of these studies to the national unconvicted jail population.\n\""I think the tweet is about as accurate as our scandalous lack of attention to what we are doing in the criminal system allows,\"" Alec Karakatsanis, the founder and Executive Director of Civil Rights Corps, said.\nGouldin concurred, saying \""It would be great if we had more information about exactly how many of the (458,600 unconvicted Americans)...spend time in jail because they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford bail. I think there is more attention being paid to the fact that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have this information we should have.\"".\nLieu tweeted, \""Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have high powered attorneys.\"".\nThe 450,000 number counts how many people are detained before their trials each year in America. However, Lieu uses it incorrectly here: included in that number are not only unconvicted inmates who are too poor to pay bail, but also unconvicted inmates who are being detained preventively and held without any bail.\nExperts confirmed that there is no national figure keeping track of how many unconvicted inmates are unable to pay bail. That said, the point of Lieu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet\\xe2\\x80\\x94that some Americans languish in jail without ever being proven guilty\\xe2\\x80\\x94is largely accurate. \\xc2\\xa0.\n\""Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they\\'ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don\\'t have high powered attorneys.\"".\n \""There is a big correlation between third grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison.

The lawsuit was filed during a one-year \\xe2\\x80\\x9clook-back\\xe2\\x80\\x9d window allowing for the filing of sexual abuse complaints that otherwise might have been beyond key deadlines known as statutes of limitation.\nThe plaintiffs allege that Cosby either raped them or forced them into sexual acts.

We still believe that no one is above the law \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including those who are rich, famous and powerful.\"" A prosecutor\\'s apparent promise is central to this controversy.\nThe Pennsylvania high court\\'s opinion centered around former Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor\\'s assurance to Cosby in 2005 that he would not be charged for drugging and sexually assaulting Constand.\nThe opinion said that Castor thought a criminal prosecution could be difficult, partly because Constand did not immediately file a complaint against Cosby. The opinion said he was also concerned about a lack of forensic evidence, and declined to prosecute the comedian.\nCastor said at the time that Constand\\'s best chance at justice for her assault was a civil lawsuit, and if Cosby knew he would not face criminal charges, then he couldn\\'t invoke his Fifth Amendment right in the civil action.\n\""The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby gave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief,\"" the court wrote. \""Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multimillion dollar settlement.\"".\nYears later, when succeeding prosecutors reopened the criminal case and filed criminal charges against Cosby, the depositions under oath were used against him at his trial.\nThe justices described the about-face as \""an affront to fundamental fairness,\"" saying \""no mere changing of the guard strips that circumstance of its inequity.\"".\nThe justices did not all agree on this matter. Three joined in the opinion, and the three remaining justices filed two separate opinions.\nFor example, in his dissent, Justice Thomas Saylor noted that a lower court made an \""explicit finding Castor made no promise that the Commonwealth would never prosecute.\"" He questioned whether the available evidence really shows that such a promise was made. Prosecutor and accusers\\' lawyers react.\nSteele, the prosecutor who charged Cosby , said in a statement that he commends \""Cosby\\'s victim Andrea Constand for her bravery in coming forward and remaining steadfast throughout this long ordeal, as well as all of the other women who have shared similar experiences.\"".\n\""Despite the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\\'s decision,\"" she said, \""this was an important fight for justice, and even though the court overturned the conviction on technical grounds, it did not vindicate Bill Cosby\\'s conduct and should not be interpreted as a statement or a finding that he did not engage in the acts of which he has been accused.\"" ."", ""evidence"": "" Bill Cosby\\'s Sexual Assault Conviction Overturned By Pennsylvania Court The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that Cosby\\'s due process rights were violated when he was charged for a 2004 assault after prosecutors told him they wouldn\\'t bring criminal charges against him."", ""nli_class"": ""neutral"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9998843""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>Bill Cosby was released from prison Wednesday after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his 2018 conviction for sexual assault, a dramatic reversal in one of the first high-profile criminal trials of the #MeToo era.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/arts/television/bill-cosby-release-conviction.html"", ""title"": ""Bill Cosby Freed as Court Overturns His Sex Assault Conviction - The New York Times"", ""full_text"": ""Bill Cosby was released from prison Wednesday after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his 2018 conviction for sexual assault, a dramatic reversal in one of the first high-profile criminal trials of the #MeToo era.\nThe court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision seemed likely to end the Pennsylvania case, legal experts said, and while more than 50 women across the nation have accused Mr. Cosby of sexual assault and misconduct, statutes of limitations in their cases makes further prosecutions unlikely.\nMr. Cosby had served three years of a three- to 10-year sentence at a maximum-security prison outside Philadelphia when the court ruled that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-prosecution agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a previous prosecutor meant that Mr. Cosby should not have been charged in the case.\nMr. Cosby, 83, returned to his home in suburban Philadelphia on Wednesday afternoon where, looking frail and walking slowly, he was helped inside by his lawyer and a spokesman. He flashed a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cV\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sign as he reached his front door.\nThe court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision overturned the first major criminal conviction of the #MeToo era, which came soon after allegations of sexual assault had been made against the powerful Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The accusations and eventual conviction of Mr. Cosby stunned the nation, painting a disturbing portrait suggesting that a man who had brightened America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s living rooms as a beloved father figure had been a sexual predator.\nThe case against Mr. Cosby began with his arrest in 2015 on charges that he had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman at his home in the Philadelphia suburbs 11 years earlier. In April 2018, the jury convicted Mr. Cosby of three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand , to whom Mr. Cosby had been a mentor and who was at the time a Temple University employee.\nMs. Constand had praised the guilty verdict at the time, saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTruth prevails,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the National Organization for Women called it \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca notice to sexual predators everywhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers, who had said at the time that allegations against Mr. Weinstein would make it difficult for them to receive a fair trial , later suggested in an appeal that the outcome had been influenced by what they described as a period of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpublic panic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAndrea Constand, who had said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTruth prevails\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when Mr. Cosby was convicted of sexually assaulting her, returning to the courtroom in 2018. Credit... Pool photo by David Maialetti.\nIn a statement issued with her lawyers, Ms. Constand said Wednesday that the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot only disappointing but of concern in that it may discourage those who seek justice for sexual assault in the criminal justice system from reporting or participating in the prosecution of the assailant or may force a victim to choose between filing either a criminal or civil action.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nIn their 79-page opinion , the judges wrote that a previous prosecutor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement that Mr. Cosby would not face charges, which paved the way for Mr. Cosby to testify in a civil trial, meant that he should not have been charged in the case. It was a 6-to-1 ruling, with two of the judges in the majority dissenting on the remedy, which barred a retrial.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which overturned Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conviction, wrote that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-prosecution agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that had been struck with Bruce L. Castor Jr., the former district attorney, meant that Bill Cosby should not have been charged in the case for which he was convicted and sentenced in 2018. The court also barred a retrial. Read the full 79-page opinion. Read Document 79 pages.\nThe case began in 2005, when Mr. Cosby was investigated in the case of Ms. Constand, and a former district attorney of Montgomery County said that he had given Mr. Cosby his assurance that he would not be charged in the case. The former district attorney, Bruce L. Castor Jr., announced in a news release at the time that after an investigation he had found \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinsufficient\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence. He later testified that he had given Mr. Cosby the assurance to encourage him to testify in a subsequent civil case brought by Ms. Constand. (A civil suit she filed against Mr. Cosby was settled in 2006 for $3.38 million.).\nIn that testimony, Mr. Cosby acknowledged giving quaaludes to women he was pursuing for sex \\xe2\\x80\\x94 evidence that played a key part in his trial after Mr. Castor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s successors reopened the case and charged Mr. Cosby in December 2015. That was just days before the 12-year statute of limitations expired in the case, and it came amid a number of new allegations from women who brought similar accusations of drugging and sexual assault against Mr. Cosby.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor D. A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s due process rights,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the appeals ruling said.\nMr. Cosby posted a picture of himself, with a fist raised above his head and his eyes closed, on Twitter , writing: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have never changed my stance nor my story. I have always maintained my innocence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nMr. Castor, who this year served as a lawyer for President Donald J. Trump during his second impeachment trial, said after the ruling was delivered on Wednesday that he believed his decision in 2005 had been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexonerated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the ruling, calling the verdict a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshellacking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the current district attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was right back in 2005 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m right in 2021,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in a phone interview. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m proud of our Supreme Court for having the courage to make an unpopular decision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBrian W. Perry, one of the lawyers representing Mr. Cosby, said he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthrilled\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with the ruling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be honest with you, we all believed, collectively, that this is how the case would end,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe did not think he was treated fairly and fortunately the Supreme Court agreed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe Montgomery County district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, said that he hoped the decision would not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdampen the reporting of sexual assaults by victims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was found guilty by a jury and now goes free on a procedural issue that is irrelevant to the facts of the crime,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Steele said in a statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want to commend Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victim Andrea Constand for her bravery in coming forward and remaining steadfast throughout this long ordeal, as well as all of the other women who have shared similar experiences.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nPatricia Steuer, 65, who accused Mr. Cosby of drugging and assaulting her in 1978 and 1980, said that she had been preparing herself for the possibility that Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conviction would be overturned but that she was still \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca little stunned\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling on Wednesday.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wondering what the 43-year ordeal that I went through was supposed to be about,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ms. Steuer, who said she found out about the decision on Facebook. But she said she was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsoled by the fact that I believe we did the only thing that we could, which is to come forward and tell the truth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nScott Berkowitz, the president of RAINN , the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are deeply disappointed in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and by the message this decision sends to the brave survivors who came forward to seek justice for what Bill Cosby did to them. This is not justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nOthers expressed support for Mr. Cosby. Phylicia Rashad, who appeared as Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wife in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Cosby Show,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d praised the decision on Twitter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFINALLY!!!!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Rashad, who was recently named the dean of Howard University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s College of Fine Arts , wrote on Twitter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA terrible wrong is being righted- a miscarriage of justice is corrected!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (She later wrote : \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI fully support survivors of sexual assault coming forward. My post was in no way intended to be insensitive to their truth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\nThe decision undoes a verdict that several women who said that they had been assaulted and raped by Mr. Cosby had praised at the time as a measure of justice that had been long in coming. In a victim impact statement filed with the court in 2018, Ms. Constand had said of Mr. Cosby: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe may never know the full extent of his double life as a sexual predator, but his decades-long reign of terror as a serial rapist is over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAnd Janice Dickinson, a former model who had told the court that Mr. Cosby raped her in 1982 after giving her a pill \\xe2\\x80\\x94 her account was one of five the prosecution presented from women who said he had drugged and sexually assaulted them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 said after the sentencing that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy heart is beating out of my chest at the moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe issue of whether the trial court had improperly allowed additional women to testify was not considered because the panel ruled that Mr. Cosby had relied to his detriment on Mr. Castor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise and then made statements in the civil case that were effectively used as evidence against him.\nIn a dissent, Justice Thomas G. Saylor disagreed that a statement Mr. Castor made in a news release represented an unconditional promise that bound his successor not to prosecute. Justice Kevin Dougherty, in a separate opinion in which he was joined by Justice Max Baer, found that though Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s due process rights had been violated when he relied on Mr. Castor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise and testified in the civil case, the remedy should not have been barring further prosecution but throwing out the evidence the prosecution gained from Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony.\nThe reversal now leaves Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s career and reputation in limbo. His conviction, after years of dodging accusations that he had preyed on women, had seemed to cap the downfall of one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best-known entertainers.\nIts overturning undid what many women had seen as an early success of the #MeToo movement, a ruling which had been praised at the time as a sign that the accounts of female accusers were being afforded greater weight and credibility."", ""evidence"": ""Bill Cosby was released from prison Wednesday after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his 2018 conviction for sexual assault, a dramatic reversal in one of the first high-profile criminal trials of the #MeToo era."", ""nli_class"": ""neutral"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9995149""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>NORRISTOWN, Pa. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Bill Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s star defense witness, a veteran academic adviser who works at his alma mater, Temple University, testified here Wednesday that the woman who has accused Mr. Cosby of sexual assault had once remarked to her how it would be easy to fabricate such a charge to frame a celebrity and get money.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/arts/television/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-trial.html"", ""title"": ""Cosby Accuser Talked of Framing a Celebrity, Witness Says - The New York Times"", ""full_text"": ""Marguerite Jackson testified Wednesday as a defense witness and said that Andrea Constand, the woman who says Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her, had once spoken of framing a celebrity.

One time, in February 2004, she said Ms. Constand told her she had been assaulted by a celebrity, after seeing a clip on television about another, unnamed star who had been so accused.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98No it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I could say it did. I could quit my job.

Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense team hopes the testimony from an experienced, mature voice will be taken seriously by the jurors and undercut Ms. Constand\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credibility.\nThe defense has portrayed Ms. Constand, 45, as a con artist who preyed on a lonely, older, wealthy entertainer and hatched a plot to siphon money from him. He paid her $3.38 million in a settlement that closed a 2005 lawsuit that she had filed against him after prosecutors initially balked at filing criminal charges in the case.\nMs. Constand\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that she was sexually assaulted by Mr. Cosby at his home near here in January 2004 after he incapacitated her with three blue pills \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was bolstered last week by the accounts of five other women who testified that they, too, believe they were drugged and sexually assaulted by him.\nMs. Constand\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credibility has been a prime focus of the retrial, as it was last summer when the first trial ended with a hung jury .\nMs. Jackson, who worked with the athletic department as an adviser between 2002 and 2006, told the jury Wednesday that she recalled her hotel room conversation with Ms. Constand in 2005, when the story broke that Mr. Cosby had been accused of assault.\nShe said she decided to come forward in 2016, after Mr. Cosby had been charged in the case, when she met a comedian on a cruise who said he could put her in touch with Mr. Cosby\\xe2\\x80\\x99s representatives.\nOn cross-examination, M. Stewart Ryan, an assistant district attorney, pointed to discrepancies and elaborations between statements Ms. Jackson has given at various points, such as quote marks that were added to the phrases she says Ms. Constand uttered.

She told the jury that the accuser, Janice Dickinson, had told her about being drugged and raped by Mr. Cosby but that her legal department would not allow publication of the accusation because there was no corroboration of the claim.

His insistence that he will not engage in budget negotiations until Democrats pass business and government reforms led to a historic impasse that has left the state with no budget -- and a fast-growing pile of debt -- since June 30, 2015.\nTo back his case for business-friendly reforms, Rauner frequently cites figures intended to demonstrate the toll Democratic policies have exacted on the state economy.\nSuch was the case June 1, when Rauner with local Republican lawmakers and school officials at the administrative offices of Community Unit School District 3 in Mahomet. Rauner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visit came a day after, for the second straight year, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly adjourned without passing either Rauner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s various reforms or a state budget.\n\""We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had massive out-migration of people and jobs. We have the highest unemployment rate of any state in America,\"" Rauner said, detailing a litany of Illinois\\xe2\\x80\\x99 problems on the business and government front. \""We have the highest level of corruption and cronyism and patronage of any state in America. We have lower family incomes in Illinois today than we had 17 years ago in Illinois. We are fundamentally in decline because of the control of (House) Speaker (Michael) Madigan and his Democrats.\"".\nRauner made several claims here, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to focus on the part about family incomes. Is it true that Illinois has lower family incomes today than in 1999?.\nAccording to his office, Rauner based his claim on U.S. Census Bureau data (click and scroll to Table H-8) for median household income from 1984 to 2014. The 2015 figure won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be out until September, so Rauner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""last 17 years\"" really means from 1999 to 2014.\nThe top chart below shows average annual household incomes for Illinois and Indiana in the period mentioned by Rauner. The lower chart shows Illinois and its neighboring states.\\xc2\\xa0.\nIndeed, the 2014 median household income in Illinois was $54,916 and the 1999 median household income, adjusted for inflation, was $65,850. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a decline of 16.6 percent.\nBut look at neighboring Indiana, which saw its median household income plummet 17.2 percent -- to the current $48,060 -- in the same time period. Or Wisconsin, which had a 10.5 percent drop. Missouri went from $58,819 in 1999 to $56,630 in 2014 -- a 3.7 percent decline.\nSo there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no disputing that Illinois\\xe2\\x80\\x99 median household income fell between 1999 and 2014, but Rauner presented the figure as if Illinois were an outlier among other states; that its political leadership had chartered a uniquely disastrous course. A look at the same time period for Indiana -- a state repeatedly cited by Rauner as a beacon of economic growth -- shows Illinois was far from alone.\nIn fact, only\\xc2\\xa0four states in the nation -- Maryland, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon\\xc2\\xa0--\\xc2\\xa0had higher median household incomes in 2014 than at some other point in the Census Bureau\\'s 30-year survey. (Only North Dakota had a Republican governor in 2014.).\nAnd 1999 is no ordinary year for Illinois in this set of numbers. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the year with the highest median household income in the 30 years covered. Had Rauner gone for a 25-year comparison and used 1991\\xe2\\x80\\x99s median household income, he would have found an increase of 1.5 percent ($54,068 in 1991 and $54,916 in 2014).\nPinpointing whether and to what extent state government policy influenced an economic trend like median household income is difficult, says Darren H. Lubotsky, a professor in the economics department at the University of Illinois-Chicago and a member of the university\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Institute of Government and Public Affairs.\nA state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industrial base is the greatest indicator of how it will reflect or resist an economic downturn like those that hit the national economy after 9/11 and in the Great Recession, Lubotsky says.\n\""Is it accurate to blame state government leadership? Maybe. Is it the unfunded pension liability? The quality of schools? Crime? The so-called culture of corruption? Maybe they all play a role or maybe only some do. I am not sure one could credibly point to what policies really matter,\"" Lubotsky says.\nRauner is stretching the time frame when he says income is lower \""today\"" than it was 17 years ago. The Census Bureau won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have 2015 figures for three more months.\nBut the bigger problem here is that by choosing the peak income year among 30 years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of data and presenting Illinois as an isolated case, Rauner tacitly asserts that Illinois is unique in seeing lower income \""today\"" than in 1999.\nAdvisor Perspectives, \"" Median Household Income by State: A New Look at the Data ,\""\u00a0(sorted tables of data from U.S. Census table above), website accessed June 17, 2016.\n \""The candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, \u2018The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.\u2019 \"" .\n These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard.

Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only summaries of their income tax returns on Nov. 27, rival Daniel Biss wasted no time blasting them for what they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make public.\nAs Gov. Bruce Rauner has done since first becoming a candidate in 2013, Pritzker and Kennedy released their federal and state 1040 forms, which reveal only basic details of their their tax pictures. The meat of returns, especially for wealthy taxpayers like Pritzker, Kennedy and Rauner, lies in an array of schedules and attachments to those 1040s that illustrate how they made their money, managed their wealth, donated to charity and reduced their tax burdens by leveraging breaks often used by the wealthy. And neither Pritzker, Kennedy nor Rauner have been willing to share such telling information with voters.\n\""These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns,\"" Biss said in one of many tweets he issued on the topic that day.\nThese guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns. -DB November 28, 2017 .\nIn April, Biss, a Democratic state senator from Evanston, released five years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of full tax returns, including Form 1040 cover sheets and attachments detailing deductions, supplemental income and credits. They showed Biss and his wife, Karin Steinbrueck, with quite modest income, averaging just under $55,000 per year over the five years covered in the returns. Biss spent more than seven months criticizing his wealthy competitors for foot-dragging before they released their returns. \\xc2\\xa0.\nWith nominating petitions now filed for the March 20 Democratic primary and election season in full swing, the Rauner and Romney comparisons likely will become a hammer with which Biss will repeatedly bash his far wealthier opponents. We decided to look into Biss\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Twitter claim both to check its accuracy and to examine the history of candidate tax disclosure.\nThe \""Bruce Rauner standard\"" that Biss, currently a state senator, cites refers to the tax disclosures Rauner has made annually since he first became a candidate for governor in 2013. Though Illinois law does not require candidates or officeholders to make public any income tax information, Rauner released three years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of federal and state 1040 forms when he filed his nominating petitions in November 2013. They showed Rauner and his wife Diana had income of $27.2 million in 2010, $28.2 million in 2011 and $53.4 million in 2012. Their effective tax rates in those years were 16.9 percent, 21.5 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\nRauner has continued to release the 1040 forms since then. His 2013 returns, released a month before the 2014 election, showed income of $60.15 million and a 24-percent tax rate. In 2014, the Rauners reported income of $57.5 million and a 26-percent tax rate.\nRauner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s income ballooned during his first two years as governor. In 2015, he reported income of $188 million followed by $91 million in 2016, with tax rates of 26 and 25, respectively.\nBut because Rauner has not released the schedules and attachments that detail how his income was derived, the 1040 forms lend little insight where his money comes from and how he manages it.\nPritzker essentially matched Rauner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skimpy disclosure when the Democrat filed his nominating petitions on Nov. 27, but Kennedy did even less. Pritzker released summaries of his last three years of taxes showing adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015 and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014).\nKennedy confined his release of 1040 information to 2016 returns only. For that year, he reported adjusted gross income $1,242,805 and an effective tax rate of 14 percent.\nThe financial picture for Kennedy and Pritzker, at least, is further obscured by their decisions to not release detail about trusts they also benefit from but which are kept separate from the information reported on their personal tax returns. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\n The 2020 election could not have been fair because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLos Angeles County agreed, during litigation, that there were 1.2 million ineligible voters after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nCandidates in Illinois are are also required to file statements of economic interest that detail entities in which they have ownership interests or derive income, and all the Democrats as well as Rauner have complied. But the information value from such reports is quite limited, with disclosures confined to the names of business interests and not the value of individual investments or income they produce. (Click here for current statements of economic interest from Rauner , Pritzker and Kennedy .).\nBiss also accuses his Democratic counterparts of \""falling dismally short\"" of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, like Rauner a longtime private equity investor whose wealth had become an issue in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat then-President Barack Obama. Romney released complete income taxes for 2010 and 2011 , including hundreds of pages of schedules and explanatory material that allowed a public view into the management of his fortune.\nThey showed Romney paid a relatively low tax rate of 14.7 percent on a total of $42.6 million in income for the two years combined, and that he held considerable assets in offshore tax havens including Luxembourg, Ireland and the Cayman Islands. In an election in which income inequality had become a major issue, this gave Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign ammunition to portray the former Massachusetts governor as out of touch with the vast majority of Americans.\nRomney was following what had become standard procedure for presidents and major presidential candidates of both parties following the scandal plagued administration of Richard Nixon, said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project , which tracks presidential tax releases. Obama also routinely released full returns annually both as a presidential contender and president.\nObama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s successor, Donald Trump, is the first U.S. president since Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974, to not release any information about personal taxes.\nA proliferation of wealthy political candidates coming off successful business careers in Illinois and elsewhere likely portends an era of increasing opaqueness when it comes to tax disclosure, Thorndike speculated.\n\""I don\\'t know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials,\"" Thorndike said. \""I suppose that they\\'re better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s.\"".\n\""These candidates if they win election are going to be in charge of collecting taxes from everyone else and it seems reasonable to me that voters want to know how they conducted themselves and whether they\\'ve been living up to their civic duty in the way that everyone else is supposed to,\"" he said.\nLawrence Noble, senior director the D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, said the current push in Washington for a sweeping federal overhaul, only underscores the shortcomings of the sort of limited tax disclosure practiced by Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy.\nAll derive the bulk of their income from investments, and are likely to reap significant financial benefit from the current GOP push in Washington to overhaul the federal tax system that most analysts have concluded is tilted toward tax breaks for the wealthy. How much any of the well-to-do Illinois candidates stand to benefit is impossible to gauge without more information than is disclosed in 1040 forms. \\xc2\\xa0.\n\""Where they have their investments, how much they have and how various pieces of legislation will affect them is important,\"" said Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. \""And one of the ways you can tell that is by their taxes and often it\\'s the only way you can tell unless you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just going to take their word for it.\"".\nBiss sarcastically said his fellow Democratic gubernatorial candidates \""are living up to\"" the standard for releasing tax information set by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. He also said they fell short of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\nLike Rauner, J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only their federal and state 1040 forms, which provide only the most basic information on income and taxes paid. And Romney did release two years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of full returns, including hundreds of pages of detail, when he was running for president in 2012.\nThere is no law in Illinois requiring gubernatorial candidates or governors to release any tax information whatsoever, and Biss is clearly engaging in some campaign hyperbole when he refers to a Rauner standard and a Romney standard. That said, we find the essence of his statements to be True.\nThese guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard.

That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not what we found last week, so we took another look.\nRauner, a wealthy private equity investor, has made a practice of releasing 1040 tax forms that give just a hazy outline of his annual earnings and taxes paid. He released three years of tax returns -- for 2010, 2011 and 2012 -- when he first filed to run for governor in 2013 and has continued to release his 1040s every year since then.\nIllinois law requires no tax disclosure from candidates, but until Rauner it had been common for candidates for the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top office to voluntarily disclose the entire contents of their tax returns in a gesture of transparency. For wealthier candidates like Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy, the two-page 1040 is just a tiny piece of their returns.\nThe more telling information is contained in what are likely dozens or hundreds of pages of schedules, forms and supporting documents attached to 1040s that detail how investment and capital gains income was derived, business losses or gains, and deductions for charitable donations.\n\""I don\\'t know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials,\"" Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project , told us for last week\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fact-check. \""I suppose that they\\'re better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s.\"".\nRauner has never released those supporting materials, nor did Pritzker or Kennedy when they disclosed the contents of recent 1040s in late November. All three candidates pitch themselves as accomplished businessmen with shrewd financial acumen, so it is significant that none are willing to release the documentation that could help voters better assess the accuracy of such claims.\n The 2020 election could not have been fair because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLos Angeles County agreed, during litigation, that there were 1.2 million ineligible voters after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBy contrast, Biss, a state senator whose annual income is mostly derived from his legislative salary, did make a complete tax disclosure. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why he sarcastically taunted Pritzker and Kennedy in a recent tweet about \""pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard\"" when it came to tax transparency.\nThese guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard.

They showed adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015, and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014).\nAccompanying the state and federal 1040 forms was a brief press release listing the income and tax rates paid, the amounts in federal and state taxes paid by trusts from which Pritzker benefits ($128.97 million and $24.95 million, respectively) and charitable giving by Pritzker himself and by his foundation ($15.3 million and $53.8 million, respectively).\nWhen we asked what constituted \""way more\"" on Pritzker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s returns, the Pritzker campaign pointed to a statement he also released about taxes paid by trusts of which he is a beneficiary.\nPritzker is descended from a family of wealthy entrepreneurs who launched the Hyatt Hotel chain, and his fortune is derived in part from inheritances passed down through trusts. Pritzker did not release the trust tax forms themselves, however, so there is no way to independently verify the accuracy of that disclosure. \\xc2\\xa0.\nThat said, holding out the trust numbers as the evidence for more fulsome disclosure than Rauner is a curious tactic. As Rauner often points out , his fortune was self-made, he inherited no money and receives no income from trusts. In short, Rauner has made no trust disclosures because he says he has no trusts.\nBut Pritzker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three years\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of 1040 state and federal cover sheets are identical to the sort of disclosure Rauner released as a candidate four years ago and what he has issued each year since.\nPritzker did release information about taxes paid by trusts that benefit him, but construing that as exceeding Rauner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disclosure is something of a straw-man argument. Rauner says he has no trusts to report income from.\nBiss releases tax returns, calls on others to do the same , Capitol Fax blog, April 14, 2017; accessed Dec. 7, 2017.\n \""The candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, \u2018The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.\u2019 \"" .\n These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard.

Clinton was the 42nd president of the United States, serving from 1993 to 2001. After he left office, he continued to be active in the public sphere, touring the world, writing books, and campaigning for Democrats , including his wife, Hillary Clinton , who served as the junior U.S. senator from New York between 2001 and 2009 and the 67th United States Secretary of State between 2009 and 2013, on her presidential campaigns in 2008 , in which she was runner-up for the Democratic nomination, and in 2016 , when she lost the election to Donald Trump . Public speaking and campaigning [ edit ] .\nHillary Rodham Clinton re-enacts being sworn in as a U.S. Senator by Vice President Gore as Bill and Chelsea Clinton observe. .\nAt the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to their house 15 Old House Lane in Chappaqua, New York , in Westchester County. Clinton opened his personal office in the Harlem section of New York City. [1] In 2000, Clinton assisted his wife in her campaign for office as Senator from New York . [2] Clinton campaigned for a number of Democratic candidates for the Senate in the 2002 elections. [3] .\nClinton comments on contemporary politics in speaking engagements around the world. [4] [5] One notable theme is his advocacy of multilateral solutions to world problems. .\nClinton spoke for the fifth consecutive time at a Democratic National Convention on July 26, 2004, praising candidate John Kerry . He said of President George W. Bush\\'s depiction of Kerry, \""strength and wisdom are not opposing values.\"" Despite Clinton\\'s speech, the post-convention bounce to Kerry\\'s poll numbers was less than was hoped for. [6] .\nClinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe, often earning $100,000 to $300,000 per speech; [7] for 13 speeches he was paid $500,000, or more. [8] According to his wife\\'s Senate ethics reports, he earned more than $30 million in speaking from 2001 to 2005. [9] In 2007, it is estimated he amassed around $40 million from speaking fees. [10] Overall, Bill Clinton earned more than $104 million from 542 paid speeches between January 2001 and January 2013. [11] [12] .\nHe was the opening speaker at the Ontario Economic Summit held on November 13, 2007 in which he addressed people on various subjects including Canada\\'s role in Afghanistan , environmentalism and access to healthcare . [13] .\nClinton served as one of the organizers for the New Baptist Covenant alongside former President Jimmy Carter and other Baptist leaders. This effort sought to bring various Baptists in America together, especially across racial lines, to discuss issues that unite them. Clinton spoke at the January 2008 celebration in Atlanta, Georgia. Post 9/11 and relations with Bob Dole [ edit ] .\nFollowing 9/11 , Clinton teamed up with his one-time political rival, former U.S. Senator Bob Dole , on the Families of Freedom Foundation, a scholarship fund campaign to pay for the college educations for the families of 9/11 victims. [14] It helped raise more than $100 million. [15] Clinton also was, for a short time in 2003, a commentator opposite Dole on CBS \\'s 60 Minutes . William J. Clinton Presidential Center [ edit ] .\nClinton dedicated his presidential library , the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Arkansas on November 18, 2004. [16] Under rainy skies, Clinton received praise from former presidents Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush , as well as from then-president George W. Bush . He was treated to a musical rendition from Bono and the Edge from U2 , who expressed their gratitude at Clinton\\'s efforts to resolve the Northern Ireland conflict during his presidency. [17] The library has the largest archives of any presidential library. .\nThe Clinton facility was funded to a large degree by donations from foreign governments, receiving a $10 million donation from the royal family of Saudi Arabia. [18] Published work [ edit ] .\nClinton released a personal autobiography , My Life in 2004. The book was published by the Knopf Publishing Group at Random House on June 22, 2004. According to the publisher, for single day non-fiction book sales, the book set a worldwide record. [19] Later released as an audio book, total sales were in excess of 400,000 copies. As a writer\\'s fee, he received U.S. $12 million in advance. [20] .\nHe released, Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World in September 2007, which became a bestseller and gandered positive reviews. [21] The book is about citizen activism and the role of public charity and public service in the modern world. [22] The audiobook version was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the category of Best Spoken Word Album . .\nIn 2011, Clinton released a book \""Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy.\"" The book details Clinton\\'s suggestions for improving the economy. William J. Clinton Foundation [ edit ] .\nThe William J. Clinton Foundation promotes and provides for a number of humanitarian causes. Within the foundation, the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI) strives to make treatment for HIV/AIDS more affordable and to implement large-scale integrated care, treatment, and prevention programs. While in Sydney to attend a Global Business Forum, Clinton signed a memorandum of understanding on behalf of his presidential foundation with the Australian government to promote HIV/AIDS programs in the Asia-Pacific region. .\nThe Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), funded by the Clinton Foundation, was inaugurated September 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9317, 2005 in New York City to coincide with the 2005 World Summit . The focus areas of the initiative include attempts to address world problems such as global public health , poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict . [23] .\nClinton announced through the William J. Clinton Foundation an agreement by major soft drink manufacturers to stop selling sugared sodas and juice drinks, in public primary and secondary schools within the United States, on May 3, 2005. [24] .\nThe foundation has received donations from a number of foreign governments, including the king of Morocco , a foundation linked to the United Arab Emirates , and the governments of Kuwait and Qatar . [25] .\nIn 2008 newspapers reported that \""Mr Clinton had travelled to Kazakhstan with a Canadian mining magnate, Frank Giustra , to meet its dictator president. Mr Giustra later won three lucrative uranium mining contracts from the government and then donated $US31 million to Mr Clinton\\'s charity.\"" [25] Relations with George H. W. Bush [ edit ] .\nIn the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina , Clinton established, with fellow former President George H. W. Bush, the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, respectively. He and Bush appeared together in television ads in 2005, encouraging aid for victims of the tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. [26] For this, they were awarded the 2006 Philadelphia Liberty Medal on October 5, 2006. [27] .\nThen-President George W. Bush, to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , named Clinton and his father George H. W. Bush to lead a nationwide campaign on January 3, 2005. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan selected Clinton to head the United Nations earthquake and tsunami relief and reconstruction effort on February 1, 2005. [28] .\nFive days later, to raise money for relief through the USA Freedom Corps , Clinton and Bush appeared on the Fox Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show. [29] Thirteen days later, to see the relief efforts, they traveled to the affected areas. [30] In April 2007, they spoke together at the funeral of Russian President Boris Yeltsin . [31] .\nClinton, along with George W. Bush , Laura Bush , George H. W. Bush , Condoleezza Rice , and Andrew Card pay their respects to Pope John Paul II before the pope\\'s funeral . Environment [ edit ] .\nTo create the Clinton Foundation Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the William J. Clinton Foundation entered into a partnership with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group on August 1, 2006, agreeing to provide resources to allow the participating cities to enter into an energy-saving product purchasing consortium and to provide technical and communications support. [32] .\nClinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Montreal on December 9, 2005. To promote initiatives concerning the environment , Clinton twice visited the University of California, Los Angeles in 2006. First, to advertise the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group , he met with Tony Blair , Ken Livingstone , Antonio Villaraigosa , and Gavin Newsom on August 1, 2006. On October 13, 2006, he spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy , which was voted down. [33] Personal health [ edit ] .\nOn September 2, 2004, while campaigning for Kerry, Clinton had an episode of angina and was evaluated at Northern Westchester Hospital . It was determined he did not suffer a coronary infarction , and he was sent home, returning the following day for angiography , which disclosed multiple vessel coronary artery disease . He was transferred to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, where he underwent a successful on-pump quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery on September 6, 2004. The medical team stated, had he not had surgery, he would have likely suffered a massive heart attack within a few months. [34] As a complication of his heart surgery, Clinton underwent a follow-up surgery on March 10, 2005 for a left pleural effusion , removing scar tissue and fluid from his left chest cavity. [35] .\nOn February 11, 2010, he was rushed to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City after complaining of chest pains, and had two coronary stents implanted in his heart. [36] [37] [38] [39] He has since recovered and become a vegan. [40] 2008 Presidential election [ edit ] .\nIn the course of the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign , Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary Clinton , leading some observers and party members to question the appropriateness of his role in view of his status as a former president. [41] Some felt that Clinton was overshadowing his wife in the campaign , [42] [43] [44] with her presidential rival Barack Obama complaining that he sometimes did not know which Clinton he was running against. [45] At an MSNBC debate, Republican primary candidate Mitt Romney said that he \""can\\'t imagine Bill Clinton left with nothing to do in the White House\"", suggesting that Clinton would be a \""co-president and try and help manage the economy and help manage the world affairs\"". [46] .\nTop Democratic Party officials, including Congressman Rahm Emanuel , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, asked Clinton to tone down his attacks on Obama following the bitterly contested Nevada caucus, suggesting that Clinton could be damaging his own political capital and global stature. [47] Some commentators even accused the former president of \""playing the race card\"" against Obama, who is half-black, by suggesting he would understand if South Carolina\\'s African Americans naturally would vote for the black candidate, but rejected suggestions that America was not ready for a black President. [48] [49] [50] Many felt that by alienating black voters who had once overwhelmingly supported the Clintons, Clinton had tarnished his legacy as the so-called \""first black president.\"" [51] [52] In particular, Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) suggested that Clinton\\'s vocal attacks on Obama could damage the former President\\'s legacy. [53] Following his wife\\'s disappointing defeat in South Carolina, Clinton again made headlines when he appeared to undermine and racialize Obama\\'s victory by comparing it to Jesse Jackson \\'s failed 1984 bid for the Presidency. [54] Some observers suggested that the controversial comments fueled Sen. Ted Kennedy \\'s decision to endorse Sen. Obama for the Presidency. [55] Clinton attracted further controversy with a series of attacks against Obama that many independents and former Clinton supporters felt to be unfair. [51] [56] [57] [58] While some believed the attacks might eventually pay off, [59] others felt they would damage Hillary Clinton\\'s presidential prospects and alienate Democratic voters in the general election. [56] [57] [60] Bill Clinton defended his role in the campaign in South Carolina , disputing claims he made race a campaign issue. [61] According to some reports, the accusations of racism hurt him personally, as blacks had long been Clinton\\'s most loyal supporters. [62] [63] .\nDuring the primary campaign, his wife\\'s aides criticized Clinton\\'s freelancing and deemed his office uncooperative\\xe2\\x80\\x93 at one point, they complained, his people would not allow one of her people to ride on his plane to campaign stops. His aides, on the other hand, stewed over what they saw as her people\\'s disregard for the advice of one of this generation\\'s great political minds and bristled at surrendering control of his schedule. On the night of the Pennsylvania primary , Clinton grew playfully competitive with his wife over who had done more events or had had more impact. Governor Ed Rendell showed Clinton the county-by-county returns, while she was superstitious and rarely watched election night coverage. According to Rendell, \""The president wanted to know exactly what the returns were in the places he had been and Hillary hadn\\'t been. He kept showing Hillary, and she would laugh.\"" [62] [63] .\nDue to Clinton\\'s prominent role in his wife\\'s presidential run and his criticism of Obama, many perceived an enduring distance between the two. Clinton was asked later if he thought presidential nominee Barack Obama was qualified to be president. He replied that the Constitution sets qualifications. When pressed as to whether Obama was \""ready\"" to be president, Clinton replied, \""You could argue that no one is ready to be president.\"" [64] Such remarks led to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama\\'s election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008 when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention , saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \""ready to lead\"". [65] Trip to North Korea [ edit ] .\nClinton made an unannounced trip to North Korea , a country with which the United States does not have diplomatic relations , on August 4, 2009. [66] Clinton arrived in Pyongyang in order to negotiate the release of U.S. citizens Euna Lee and Laura Ling , who were imprisoned by North Korean forces for illegally entering the country from China while filming a documentary and given a 12-year sentence. [67] His visit to North Korea is the second such trip by a former U.S. president, the other occurring when Jimmy Carter visited in 1994. [67] After meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il , Kim issued a special pardon for the two journalists. [68] On the morning of August 5, the journalists were released from custody and flew home to the United States with Clinton. [69] Relations with George W. Bush [ edit ] .\nIn 2009, Clinton was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti . [70] On January 16, 2010, in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake , U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush will coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti\\'s recovery. [71] Clinton established, with fellow former President George W. Bush, the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund. 2012 presidential election [ edit ] .\nClinton was a major surrogate for President Barack Obama in the election year, most notably delivering a forty-five-minute speech on the second night of the Democratic National Convention, 2012 that was well received in the press, with former Romney consultant Alex Castellanos even stating Clinton had \""won the election\"" for Obama. Clinton remained a powerful surrogate for the President, and was the second person Obama called after receiving Republican candidate Mitt Romney \\'s concession. Clinton also later spoke with Romney, mentioning he felt that Hurricane Sandy had secured Obama\\'s victory. [72] Many, including David Axelrod , have stated Clinton played a crucial role in Obama\\'s campaign. [73] 2016 presidential election [ edit ] .\nOver the course of the election year, Clinton supported the presidential campaign of his wife Hillary. In early January, Republican primary frontrunner Donald Trump suggested that Clinton\\'s past infidelities could harm his wife\\'s campaign, Clinton afterward dismissing him: \""Donald Trump says a lot of things\"". [74] On March 21, Clinton made comments about putting \""the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us\"", leading to speculation that he was negatively referring to the Obama presidency. However, on March 24, Hillary Clinton said that her husband was actually referring to the difficulty Obama had in compromising with Republicans. [75] .\nOn June 29, 2016, Clinton had a private conversation with Attorney General Loretta Lynch in Phoenix, Arizona. Clinton\\'s meeting with Lynch, while his wife Hillary was under an FBI probe for the use of a private e-mail server, raised questions about a conflict of interest as well as the ability of the Department of Justice to conduct an independent investigation. Clinton and Lynch insisted that their conversation was purely social. [76] [77] .\nOn November 10, a Clinton aide said he had phoned Trump that afternoon to congratulate the president-elect on his victory. [78] On December 20, Trump tweeted that Clinton called him after the election, which Clinton himself shortly afterward confirmed, and that the former president \""doesn\\'t know much\"" about attracting voters in swing states . [79] .\nClinton served as a member of the United States Electoral College for the state of New York. [80] He voted for the Democratic ticket consisting of his wife Hillary and her running-mate Tim Kaine . 2020 presidential election [ edit ] .\nClinton spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention on August 18, 2020 in support of Joe Biden . Clinton again served as a member of the United States Electoral College from New York, casting his vote for the Democratic ticket of Biden and Kamala Harris . On January 20, 2021, the Clintons attended Biden\\'s inauguration. Along with Obama and George W. Bush, Clinton laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery \\'s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , and recorded a segment for the Celebrate America special offering words of wisdom for the new president.

Their denials have been debunked, Trump has contradicted his senior aides and sometimes his team has completely flipped its position. .\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election along with potential collusion between Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign and the Russian government. So far, six Trump associates have been charged, but nobody has been implicated in collusion. Trump adamantly denies collusion. .\nPublic contradictions, walkbacks and flip-flops have become a hallmark of how Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team has responded to the Russia probe, which was launched in 2016 and is now in its third year. .\nIn July 2016, while he was chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort flatly denied any ties existed between the campaign and Russia, calling the idea \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsurd\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in an ABC News interview. Two days after Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s victory, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nAsked in January 2017 if there had been contacts with Russians, Trump replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c No, not at all. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0These blanket denials were later repeated by Vice President Mike Pence, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. .\nThese adamant denials have been eviscerated in the two-plus years since the election. At least 16 Trump associates had contacts with Russians during the campaign or before the inauguration, according to public statements, court filings, and news reports. \\t.\nSenior campaign aides and members of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family were in contact with Russians through in-person meetings , phone calls , emails , Twitter messages and more. Trump now acknowledges that there were contacts but says there was no collusion. .\nTrump has said on several occasions that there was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c no collusion whatsoever \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0between his campaign and the Russians, a blanket denial that seems to cover his entire campaign. (He has also said dozens of times that there was simply \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno collusion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) In an interview with Fox News, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said that there was no collusion between the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c upper levels of the Trump campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0and the Russians. .\nGiuliani moved the goalposts in January 2019 in an interview with CNN. He said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I have not. I said the President of the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These comments came shortly after unredacted court filings revealed that while Manafort led Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, he gave internal polling data to a Russian with intelligence ties. \\t.\nSanders said something similar in January after Trump ally Roger Stone was charged with lying about his ties to WikiLeaks, saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was no collusion. There was no wrongdoing by the President .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nDonald Trump Jr. secretly met a group of Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016, along with his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort. The meeting wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t revealed until a series of articles a year later. When the news broke, Trump Jr. put out a statement, claiming, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nThe adoption issue is closely tied to economic sanctions imposed by the US against Russia after the 2014 Ukraine crisis, and lifting those sanctions is a top priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump Jr.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement about the meeting, which the President had a hand in crafting, gave the false impression that the meeting had nothing to do with the 2016 election. .\nThe New York Times later revealed that the true nature of the meeting was for the Trump campaign to get damaging information about Clinton , the Democratic nominee. Trump Jr. later acknowledged this and released an email chain showing that he was told that the Russian government wanted to help Trump win and that a Russian lawyer could provide him with dirt on Clinton. \\t.\nThe President eventually admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c This was a meeting to get information on an opponent ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but said it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctotally legal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump Jr. testified on Capitol Hill that the Russians didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually bring any dirt and the meeting was a bust . .\nAs news was breaking about the Trump Tower meeting, Trump and his lawyers insisted he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t involved in writing the misleading statement issued under his son\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name. Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow told CNN: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c That was written by Donald Trump Jr. and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure with consultation with his lawyer. That wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t written by the President.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (He repeated this false denial in several interviews that week.) \\t.\nIn a confidential letter sent to Mueller in January 2018, the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers admitted that Trump dictated the controversial statement but they maintained that it was accurate. According to The New York Times, they wrote: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have received all of the notes, communications and testimony indicating that the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, Jr.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s official explanation for firing FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 was that Comey mismanaged the Clinton email investigation and lost the confidence of rank-and-file FBI agents. The White House said this rationale was backed up by letters of recommendation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions \\t.\nDays later, Trump contradicted the official story. In a now-infamous interview, he told NBC News: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It\\'s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\\'ve won.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nAbout a year later, Giuliani similarly linked Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s firing to Russia . He said Comey was dismissed after refusing to assure Trump that he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a target of the Russia investigation. .\nComey claimed that during a private meeting at the White House in February 2017, Trump asked him to drop the FBI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation into Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser. Comey detailed these claims in contemporaneous memos and testified to Congress that Trump said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nTrump has categorically denied Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims. The President also tweeted a denial in December 2017, saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn . Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nShortly after joining Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal team, Giuliani contradicted the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consistent denials about Comey and Flynn. Giuliani told ABC News that Trump asked Comey to give Flynn \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca break,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and emphasized that Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments were a friendly request and not an order from the President. \\t.\nGiuliani later backpedaled from his comments and denied that any conversation about Flynn ever took place between Trump and Comey. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was no conversation about Michael Flynn,\"" Giuliani told CNN. .\nThe special counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office has long sought a one-on-one interview with Trump for its investigation. Trump has publicly expressed interest in doing it. Trump told reporters he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c100 percent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d willing to testify under oath about his interactions with Comey. In January 2018, Trump said he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9clooking forward to it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when asked about an interview with Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team. \\t.\nA date was set for an interview at the presidential retreat at Camp David, but Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal team rejected the plan and the interview fell through at the last moment. Even after that, Trump said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I would like to\\xe2\\x80\\x9d testify. .\nTrump and Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers battled throughout 2018 over the contours of the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony. Trump lawyers fought with their client as well, trying to tamp down his desire to testify. They eventually submitted written answers to Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s questions around Thanksgiving 2018. \\t.\nCNN later reported that Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team rebuffed yet another request for an interview with the special counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Giuliani said a presidential interview would happen \""over my dead body.\"" Giuliani had warned that he opposes an interview because he believes Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prosecutors will try to lure Trump into a perjury trap. .\nMueller continues to investigate the question of whether any of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions or statements amounted to obstruction of justice. In December 2017, Trump attorney John Dowd told Axios that a sitting president \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nOne month later, Dowd and Sekulow laid out this legal theory in a confidential letter to Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team, arguing that actions authorized by the Constitution cannot be obstruction , including the official action of firing an FBI director. .\nMonths later, Giuliani expressed the opposite view. CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chris Cuomo asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\'t think a president can obstruct justice?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Giuliani\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answer was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe can,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d breaking with the theory that a president can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t obstruct justice because he essentially leads the Justice Department. \\t.\nAt the outset, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal team struck a respectful tone when talking about Mueller. White House special counsel Ty Cobb told Reuters that Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigators were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cappropriately focused.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In early 2018, Dowd praised Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s indictment of 13 Russian trolls who interfered in the US election. After leaving the legal team, Dowd said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c We had a terrific relationship with Mueller \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 completely open, people trusted each other and we had no misunderstandings.\"" \\t.\nThese lawyers oversaw a period of extensive cooperation with Mueller, providing thousands of documents and making White House aides available for interviews. .\nTrump shuffled around his legal team in spring 2018 and hired Giuliani to mount an aggressive campaign against Mueller in the press. Giuliani has said Mueller is running the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmost corrupt investigation I have ever seen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He also called for an investigation into Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct and accused him of hiding anti-Trump bias on his team. \\t.\nTrump branded the investigation a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwitch hunt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisgrace to our nation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He has repeatedly referred to Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team as a group of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cangry Democrat thugs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Mueller is a lifelong Republican and was appointed by Rosenstein, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handpicked No. 2 at the Justice Department. Some members of Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team previously donated to Democrats, which is permitted under department rules.) .\nThe New York Times reported in March 2018 that Dowd had previously floated the possibility of pardons with lawyers representing Manafort and Flynn. Cobb swiftly denied the story and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c No pardons are under discussion or under consideration at the White House.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nMonths later, the topic of pardons came up again when Manafort was convicted on eight counts of financial fraud in August 2018. Sanders said from the White House podium, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce again, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something that has been up for discussion .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nOne day after Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 denial, Giuliani acknowledged that he recently discussed pardons with Trump. Giuliani told the Huffington Post that they had \\xe2\\x80\\x9c a quick meeting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about pardons , and that they agreed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot to pardon anybody during the pendency of the investigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nTrump later contradicted Giuliani and claimed that pardons weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ever discussed, but also refused to rule one out for Manafort. \""It was never discussed, but I wouldn\\'t take it off the table . Why would I take it off the table?\"" he said in an interview with the New York Post. .\nThroughout the 2016 campaign and well into the first two years of his presidency, Trump denied having any business dealings in Russia. He issued blanket denials on the campaign trail, and \\xc2\\xa0 repeatedly claimed that he had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing to do with Russia.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shortly before taking office in January 2017, Trump said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia , because we\\'ve stayed away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company explored a lucrative real estate deal in Russia deep into the 2016 campaign. Trump shifted his story after his former attorney pleaded guilty in December 2018 to lying to Congress about the Moscow project. Trump said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis deal was a very public deal. Everybody knows about this deal . I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trying to hide anything,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d despite the fact that the deal was never disclosed before he took office. .\nIn September 2015, a few months after Trump launched his presidential campaign, the Trump Organization began discussions for a Trump Tower in Moscow. Michael Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump and a senior executive at the Trump Organization, led the negotiations with a Russian company. \\t.\nIn his September 2017 closed-door testimony to lawmakers, Cohen described it as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crejected proposal to build a Trump property in Moscow that was terminated in January of 2016 ; which occurred before the Iowa caucus and months before the very first primary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIn November 2018, Cohen admitted that he lied to Congress about Trump Tower Moscow and pleaded guilty to perjury. Negotiations continued \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas late as approximately June 2016,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to court filings. Mueller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team asked Trump written questions about when the proposal fell through, and Giuliani said their answer \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccovered all the way up to November 2016 .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nIn subsequent TV interviews, Giuliani repeated that conversations could have continued \\xe2\\x80\\x9c up until November 2016 .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Giuliani later backtracked and said his comments were \\xe2\\x80\\x9chypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the President.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIn December 2018, Giuliani told CNN that Trump never signed a letter of intent for the Trump Tower Moscow project, which was pursued by his company during the 2016 presidential campaign. Giuliani said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a real estate project. There was a letter of intent to go forward, but no one signed it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nShortly after Giuliani\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments, CNN published copies of the document bearing Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signature, confirming that Trump did sign the non-binding agreement for a real estate deal in the heart of Moscow. Giuliani backtracked from his original statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was wrong if I said it,\"" he told CNN. \""I haven\\'t seen the quote, but I probably meant to say there was never a deal, much less a signed one.\"" .\nBefore any of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign aides got in trouble, he painted them as the best and brightest people who could be involved on a presidential team. Trump said foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was \\xe2\\x80\\x9can excellent guy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when he named Papadopoulos as an adviser in March 2016. \\t.\nWhen Manafort resigned from the campaign in August 2016, Trump said he was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and commended Manafort as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrue professional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nPapadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the campaign. Trump downplayed Papadopoulos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 role, saying: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFew people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Others in the Trump orbit said Papadopoulos was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoffee boy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the campaign who had no influence. \\t.\nDuring Manafort financial fraud trial in summer 2018, Trump distanced himself from his onetime campaign chairman. Trump said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManafort has nothing to do with our campaign \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Paul Manafort worked for me for a very short period of time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTrump and his team praised Cohen countless times, before he flipped. At a closed-door fundraiser in 2017, Trump said, \""Michael is a great lawyer ... a loyal, wonderful person,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to audio leaked by The Intercept. Trump criticized the FBI raids in April 2018 against Cohen and said they were a disgraceful move against \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca good man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nShortly after that, Trump wrote in a tweet that he \\xe2\\x80\\x9calways liked and respected\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cohen, whom he described as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfine person\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who was unlikely to assist investigators. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just Trump, either -- Giuliani said Cohen was \""an honest, honorable lawyer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after the FBI raids. .\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s relationship with Cohen deteriorated as it became clear that his ex-lawyer was open to helping federal investigations into Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company and campaign. Trump and his lawyers said Cohen should not be trusted , despite Cohen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decade-long role at the Trump Organization. Giuliani said Cohen was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpathological liar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and said that Cohen \\xe2\\x80\\x9clied all his life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t.\nTrump sharply criticized Cohen for secretly taping him. He even called Cohen a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for cooperating with Mueller. Trump also downplayed Cohen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s onetime role as his attorney, saying Cohen \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas a PR person who did small legal work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ."", ""evidence"": ""Over the past two years, President Donald Trump and his team have offered changing accounts regarding key matters in the Russia investigation."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9794756""}, {""snippet"": ""Comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president. <b>Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/11/donald-trump-james-comey-firing-russia-investigation"", ""title"": ""Donald Trump admits \\'this Russia thing\\' part of reasoning for firing Comey | Donald Trump | The Guardian"", ""full_text"": ""Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing The Guardian app Video Podcasts Pictures Newsletters Today's paper Inside the Guardian The Observer Guardian Weekly Crosswords Wordiply Corrections Facebook Twitter Search jobs Holidays Digital Archive Guardian Puzzles app Guardian Licensing.\nDonald Trump has said he was thinking of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis Russia thing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when he decided James Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 contradicting the White House rationale that he fired the FBI director for mishandling the Clinton email investigation.\nComey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president. Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nTrump also said there were three occasions on which Comey assured him he was not under investigation. The president said he called the director of the FBI to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with Russia.\nIn the NBC interview Trump also flatly contradicted his own vice-president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire James Comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general.\nTrump recalled three conversations with Comey about the FBI investigation into Russian interference in last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential election. First, he said, there was a dinner which was also about Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future, raising the prospect that Trump could threaten his job.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wanted to stay on at the FBI,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll, you know, consider and see what happens \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 But we had a very nice dinner, and at that time he told me, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You are not under investigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\nThen there were two phone calls, one made by Trump, another by Comey. The president admitted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI actually asked him, yes. I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation? He said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98You are not under investigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism. Perceptions that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal. Meanwhile, Trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal, but highly irregular. On Thursday, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general Loretta Lynch\\xe2\\x80\\x99s controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last June, during the investigation into Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of a private email server while secretary of state.\nMatthew Miller , a former spokesman for the Department of Justice, told MSNBC: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s completely inappropriate for [Trump] to ask that question \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 It would also be a violation of DoJ rules for James Comey to answer it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAsked at Thursday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s White House press briefing if it was inappropriate for Trump to have asked Comey if he was under investigation, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nShe added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been commenting on it over the last hour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sanders did not identify which \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegal scholars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that she was referring to.\nWhen the president fired Comey on Tuesday, the White House released a memo from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein that criticised Comey for mishandling last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation into Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails. Press secretary Sean Spicer claimed it was this memo that prompted Trump to remove Comey, a position backed by vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday.\nPence said in an interview with CNN that Trump had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmade a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBut in the NBC interview, Trump said of Comey: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a showboat, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recovered from that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nHe explained: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was going to fire Comey. My decision. I was going to fire Comey. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good time to do it, by the way. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe revelation came amid a flurry of reports suggesting that Trump had grown increasingly irate with Comey in recent weeks because of his high profile, his failure to stop leaks, his pursuit of the Russia investigation and his lack of support for the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama.\nIn the end, he fired Comey late on Tuesday afternoon, a move that seemed to take many White House staff by surprise. The official reason given was the FBI director\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mishandling of the investigation into Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails.\nThe acting head of the FBI, meanwhile, said on Thursday that Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff \\xe2\\x80\\x93 directly contradicting the White House assertion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can tell you I worked very, very closely [with Comey] from the time we started at the Washington field office,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hold Director Comey in the highest regard for his considerable abilities and his integrity. It is the greatest honour of my professional life to have worked with him. He enjoyed broad support in the FBI and he still does to this day \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nIn contrast, Sanders told reporters on Thursday that she had been in contact with \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccountless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FBI agents via text and email who expressed their support for the decision. She did not identify them or explain why a White House press staffer would be in contact with FBI agents.\nEarlier on Thursday, Sanders told CBS News Trump was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery likely\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to visit FBI headquarters \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin the next few days\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. But later the MSNBC network reported that the visit would not be happening after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly.\nDonald Trump, the first US president since Richard Nixon to fire the person leading an investigation that bears on him, is certainly acting like a man with something to hide.\nThe White House claims Comey was fired for mishandling an inquiry into Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails and that Trump had been losing confidence in him since the election. But few find this explanation credible, given that Trump previously praised Comey for showing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in his scrutiny of Clinton.\nCritics say the true motive was Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refusal to drop the FBI\\'s inquiry into possible links between Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s associates and Russia during last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election campaign.\nMatters had come to a head: the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growing anger and frustration at Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s focus on Russia and his failure to stop leaks from the FBI; the identification of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former national security adviser Michael Flynn as a blackmail risk; and reports, denied by the justice department, that Comey was asking for more resources to accelerate his work.\nNumerous Democrats have accused Trump of a cover-up, drawn comparisons with Nixon and Watergate, and demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor. Republican leaders have resisted this call and stood by the president, although others have dissented .\nMaking his first public appearance since Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismissal, McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s associates and Russia during last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election. He said he had met Trump this week but the Russian investigation did not come up.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing and upholding the constitution,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Later he said the Russian investigation would be pursued \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvigorously and completely\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nTo reports of Comey having asked for more resources for the investigation, McCabe said he was not aware of any such request and insisted the Russian investigation had the resources it needed.\nOpening the hearing on global threats that heard evidence from the heads of the main US intelligence agencies, the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, said it would not be solely focused on the Trump-Russia enquiry. However, Democratic senators repeatedly returned to the issue.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the top Democrat on the committee, Mark Warner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s firing of FBI director Comey \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 was a shocking development.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe timing of Director Comey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling. He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to interfere in our election.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation. And that is unacceptable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nIt emerged on Wednesday evening that the committee had issued a subpoena for the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, requesting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdocuments relevant to the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nComey \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who found out he had been fired when the news flashed up on a screen behind him when he was addressing staff in Los Angeles \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sent a farewell letter to FBI staff on Wednesday.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he wrote. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the constitution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nHelp Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs."", ""evidence"": ""Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Rus ...evidence too long",0

In fact,\u00a0all of\u00a0the prosecutions by the attorney general \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say all, but a great majority of the prosecutions by the attorney general occur with respect to vote by mail.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAs the official now charged with prosecuting election fraud in Texas,\u00a0I can say unequivocally that\u00a0the legislator\u00a0was right: going back more than a decade and continuing through the present day, around two-thirds of election fraud offenses prosecuted by\u00a0my\u00a0office have involved some form of mail-ballot fraud.\nOne\u00a0man\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0after forging\u00a01,200\u00a0mail-in\u00a0ballot applications,\u00a0resulting\u00a0in 700 suspected fraudulent\u00a0votes in a 2017 Dallas election.\u00a0He was identified after a voter, whose ballot he harvested, snapped a photo of him on her cellphone.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAuthentic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d signatures\u00a0are\u00a0also collected from voters, either under false pretenses or by experienced harvesters who confidently gain compliance from voters, as illustrated in a video that surfaced during the 2018 primary in\u00a0the Houston area.\nThe anonymous video appears to show how easily a ballot application and signature were collected from a voter by a campaign worker in less than 20 seconds.\u00a0After providing her signature, the voter asked the worker: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this legal, what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The worker replied: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done 400 already.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nIn South\u00a0Texas, a former U.S. Postal Service employee was convicted of bribery in a federal prosecution in 2017 for selling a list of absentee voters to vote harvesters for $1,200.\nOnce mail ballots go out, harvesters show up at a voter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s door and engage the voter to provide \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoting assistance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The variations are endless, but a common\u00a0practice\u00a0involves giving the voter the impression that the harvester is an election official.\nWhatever the case, successful vote harvesters leave with a voter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signature and a ballot that is either blank, voted in the way the harvester wants, or that can be modified (or disposed of) later.\nSkilled vote harvesters appear friendly and helpful. They may engage the voter in reassuring political discourse while assisting the voter in filling out the ballot.

Mail ballot fraud has been documented across the country. In fact, the Heritage Foundation has helpfully assembled a searchable database of over 1,000 instances of election fraud resulting in some form of plea, penalty or judicial finding.\nMany of those cases involving abuse of absentee ballots. Indeed, one of the most infamous instances of election fraud in recent memory \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the 2018 contest for the 9th Congressional District in North Carolina \\xe2\\x80\\x93 involved large-scale fraud conducted by ballot harvesters.\nPresident Trump is right to decry California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\u00a0or any other state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\u00a0plan to send every registered voter in the state a mail ballot ahead of November\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election. The potential for abuse by professional ballot\u00a0harvesters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 much like what happened in North Carolina \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is high.\nThe risk of abuse, which has been documented and explained\u00a0numerous times,\u00a0somehow escaped mention in Twitter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfact check\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweets.

Briscoe Cain, R - Deer Park, waits on the House floor for the start of the debate of Senate Bill 7, known as the Election Integrity Protection Act, at the Capitol on Sunday May 30, 2021, in Austin, Texas. (Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman) .\nTexas\u00a0Democrats' boldest action this legislative session came in the 11th hour of the second-to-last day of the 140-day gathering.\u00a0In a discrete but dramatic walkout from the House floor,\u00a0they left the Republicans\u2019 sweeping overhaul of Texas election laws to\u00a0expire\u00a0as the shot-clock wound down\u00a0\u2014 at least for now.\nThe last-minute maneuvering from state Democrats, who\u00a0haven\u2019t\u00a0controlled a single branch of power since 2002,\u00a0bore a striking resemblance to the political gamesmanship\u00a0of 2013, when state\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth,\u00a0led\u00a0a marathon\u00a0filibuster\u00a0to run out the clock on\u00a0a\u00a0restrictive abortion bill.\u00a0The similarity even\u00a0struck Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\""The last time a stunt like this happened was... Wendy Davis. We all know how that story ended,\""\u00a0Abbott tweeted, referring to\u00a0the revival of the anti-abortion bill in a\u00a0second\u00a0special session\u00a0that ultimately saw its passage. (Years later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck it down.).\nAbbott already has vowed to\u00a0convene a special session to revive Senate Bill 7,\u00a0known as the Election Integrity Protection Act of 2021, and other legislative priorities that went down with it.\nSB 7 was introduced\u00a0by\u00a0Republican\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Bryan Hughes,\u00a0who has\u00a0emphasized voter fraud concerns in Texas, though he has overstated\u00a0the problem by citing the number of cases being investigated , not the actual number of prosecutions.\u00a0Its House version was\u00a0carried\u00a0by Rep. Briscoe Cain, a\u00a0firebrand Republican who\u00a0notably\u00a0flew to\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0in the days after the presidential election\u00a0to\u00a0help\u00a0the Trump campaign seek to overturn election results.\nThe bill was initially introduced as 23 pages of changes to the state\u2019s election code\u00a0that Democrats argued\u00a0would\u00a0restrict early voting access in ways that would disproportionately impact people of color.\u00a0Republicans argued that it was simply a measure to restore people\u2019s faith in elections.\nBut by Saturday, Republican leaders unveiled a new version of SB 7 after private negotiations among\u00a0Republicans from the House and Senate.\u00a0The new version, which added\u00a0another 23 changes that\u00a0expanded\u00a0the bill to 67 pages,\u00a0took Democrats by surprise.\n\""Some of these\u00a0(changes) were never heard in committee, and the public never got the opportunity and nor did the committee members get the opportunity to hear these changes,\""\u00a0said\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Jessica\u00a0Gonz\u00e1lez, D-Dallas,\u00a0on the House floor Sunday.\nThe expanded\u00a0iteration\u00a0of the bill is more sweeping than the original version.\u00a0Here we review the major changes the\u00a0original bill would make to voting access and the major\u00a0new\u00a0changes Republicans tacked on to it\u00a0in the session\u2019s final weekend.\nMany of the major changes SB 7 would make to the state election code target Harris County, which\u00a0increased voting access during the early voting period ahead of the November election\u00a0in ways responsive to the coronavirus pandemic.\nElection officials in the state\u2019s largest county opened eight 24-hour polling centers in areas with high numbers of overnight workers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0near\u00a0Houston's\u00a0medical center and ship channel. The county also opened drive-thru voting locations during early voting\u00a0to allow people to vote without having to leave their car. Nearly 145,000 Texans availed themselves of these new voting options, which helped the county surpass its all-time record for number of votes cast before the early voting period was over.\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick railed against these measures, arguing that\u00a0county officials came up with these methods \""out of thin air\"" and that they weren't explicitly allowed by state law.\u00a0County officials counter that nothing in the law precluded 24-hour voting or drive-thru locations, and several legal challenges last year to the expanded voting methods were unsuccessful.\n\u2022 Banning\u00a0drive-thru voting or polling places inside tents or other temporary structures, with no voting allowed from inside a vehicle except by those with a disability who qualify for curbside voting.\u00a0An analysis of the county\u2019s early voting rosters conducted by the Texas Civil Rights Project shows that people of color used the drive-thru voting sites at higher rates than whites. Patrick responded to arguments that this change would\u00a0disproportionately\u00a0impact people of color\u00a0by claiming that\u00a0\""statistics show that more people of color don't have cars than not. So how do (drive-thru voting centers) help those folks?\""\u00a0PolitiFact rated his claim False .\n\u2022 Banning\u00a024-hour voting or extended hours for in-person voting by\u00a0mandating that voting centers could open\u00a0no earlier than 6 a.m. and close no later than 9 p.m.\n\u2022 Requiring election officials to send vote-by-mail applications only to voters who request one. Government officials who violate the restriction could be charged with a state jail felony and be sentenced to up to two years in jail.\n\u2022 Banning election officials from sending voter registration applications to prospective voters with their name and address filled in, a strategy that advocates say increases the likelihood of registration.\n\u2022 Requiring people who vote by mail to include their driver's license number, their state ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number on the inner envelope. Ballots would be rejected if the numbers aren't included or do not match what the voter listed on the vote-by-mail application.\n\u2022 And the bill also\u00a0broadens access for\u00a0partisan poll watchers\u00a0to\u00a0monitor\u00a0polling locations, including giving poll watchers the ability to record voters receiving assistance from poll workers\u00a0if the poll watcher believes the assistance is unlawful.\u00a0Opponents\u00a0of SB 7\u00a0have argued this measure can lead to voter intimidation.\nRepublicans'\u00a0late additions made a sweeping elections bill even more sweeping. The bill\u2019s length had more than doubled with\u00a0new requirements and penalties\u00a0across the entire voting process.\n\u2022 Requiring anyone\u00a0who drives three or more people to the polls for curbside voting to provide their name and address on a form provided by an election worker and indicate whether they are also providing help to a voter based on a disability. Drivers related to all passengers would be exempt\u00a0from this rule.\n\u2022 Requiring anyone\u00a0who helps\u00a0another person cast an in-person ballot due to a\u00a0physical limitation or language barrier\u00a0fill out a form listing their name, address and relationship to the voter and saying whether they accepted money or another benefit from \""a candidate, campaign, or political committee.\"".\n\u2022 Vote harvesting, defined as receiving compensation for interacting with voters with the intent to deliver votes for a specific candidate or ballot measure, would be a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in prison.\n\u2022 Republicans added language that could make it easier for a judge to overturn an election\u00a0\""if the number of votes illegally cast in the election is equal to or greater than the number of votes necessary to change the outcome of\u00a0the election.\"" On these grounds, a judge\u00a0could\u00a0void election results\u00a0if there is a preponderance of evidence that fraud occurred, which is a lower standard than\u00a0having to show proof beyond a\u00a0reasonable\u00a0doubt.\nLastly, SB7 would prohibit polling places from opening before 1 p.m. on the last Sunday of early voting.\u00a0This\u00a0measure appeared\u00a0to target \""Souls to the Polls\"" events, a longstanding tradition among Black churches\u00a0where congregations\u00a0vote after worship\u00a0services.\n\""Those election workers want to go to church, too,\"" Hughes said on Saturday, according to the\u00a0Texas Tribune . \""And so that's why it says 1 p.m.\u00a0(and)\u00a0no later than 9 p.m. You can make Sunday service and go after that.\"".\nBut this week Republicans\u00a0changed the\u00a0story. The Sunday requirement was due to a\u00a0clerical error, Rep. Travis Clardy, R-Nacogdoches, first\u00a0revealed\u00a0in a Tuesday morning NPR interview with Steve Inskeep.\n\""That's one of the things I look forward to fixing the most (in special session),\"" Clardy said.\u00a0\""Call it a scrivener's error or whatever you want to, but I talked to our team yesterday to regroup what happened. That was not intended to be reduced. What should have been 11 got printed up as 1.\u00a0So\u00a0we intended to have extended hours instead of 7 to 7 in most locations.\"".\nIn an interview later that day, Clardy, who co-chaired the House Elections Committee, said it was too late to change\u00a0the error by the time the bill made it to the House floor.\n\""There were a lot of people and a lot of pressure to get a lot of things done \u2014 this was not the only bill up on Sunday night. \u2026\u00a0We were jammed up,\"" Clardy said.\nAccording to him, the error originated\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0Texas\u00a0Legislative Council, the agency that assists legislators with bill drafting, policy analysis and research.\u00a0Legislators had already flagged the error in their private meetings, but the council\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0correct it before the final version was\u00a0engrossed, he said.\n\""You can\u2019t let perfect be the enemy of good,\""\u00a0Clardy\u00a0said. \""We want it to be perfect, don\u2019t misunderstand me. But I\u2019m frustrated by how long it took to get this bill set so that we could avoid some of the last-minute push.\"".\n\""When that election integrity bill is brought back up in special session, I promise you it\u2019s going to say 11 o\u2019clock,\"" he said. .\nTexas Tribune, Here's\u00a0how Texas elections would change, and become more restrictive, under the bill Texas Republicans are pushing , April 21, 2021 .\nTexas Tribune, Republicans say they\u2019ll tweak part of Texas elections bill criticized for impact on Black churchgoers , June 1, 2021 .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the last several months, the Biden administration has released over 7,000 illegal aliens who were COVID positive just in one Texas city.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Biden\\'s border policies are \""endangering not just the people of Texas, but people all across the country.\"" .\n \""Democrats like to blame Republicans on (low vaccination rates).

Hospitals, law enforcement and other public services, he said, are being overwhelmed.\nAt first, because of the sender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tone, I ignored the attachment. Then it arrived again, this time forwarded by a friendly reader. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe the e-mail, he said, but wanted me to know that three friends had sent it to him. And 10 of its facts were said to have originated in this newspaper.\nI started reading the chain letter, which carried the title \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust One State.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It asked me to forward its message to at least two other people. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf this doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t open your eyes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it declared, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing will.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m all in favor of having my eyes opened -- and then making sure my eyes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deceive me. So I took the 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstats\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and focused a little light on them. I waded deep into The Times\\xe2\\x80\\x99 archive with the help of our librarian Scott Wilson, and made a few phone calls too.\nWhat did I find? A stew made up for the most part of meaty exaggerations and spicy conjecture, mixed in with some giblets of truth. Two of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstats\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are the musings of a conservative op-ed writer. Another takes its information from a government \\xe2\\x80\\x9creport\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that is, in fact, a work of fiction.\nThe last two items on the list are the most accurate -- but they reveal more about the prejudices and fears of the people passing the list along than they do about the supposed effect of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillegals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n1. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c40% of all workers in L.A. County are working for cash and not paying taxes. . . . This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants working without a green card.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe source of this information seems to be a 2005 study by the Economic Roundtable on the informal economy in Los Angeles County. Its findings were reported in The Times and other papers.\nBut the chain-mail\\xe2\\x80\\x99s author more than doubled the figures in that study, which estimated that 15% of the county workforce was outside the regulated economy in 2004. Illegal immigrants getting paid in cash, it said, probably made up about 9% of the workforce.\nWe traced this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to a 2004 op-ed in The Times by Heather Mac Donald of the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. Mac Donald said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cofficers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d told her about the warrants. She conceded that there were no such data in official reports but suggested the LAPD \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctop brass\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was hiding the truth.\nI called the LAPD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s press office, which contacted the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fugitive Warrant Section. Officers confirmed that the statistics in item No. 2 and No. 3, which follows, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist.\nWe traced this figure to something circulating on the Internet under the name \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe 2006 (First Quarter) INS/FBI Statistical Report on Undocumented Immigrants.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The \\xe2\\x80\\x9creport\\xe2\\x80\\x9d contains similar figures for Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities. But it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an actual government document. The INS ceased to exist in 2003, after the Department of Homeland Security was created.\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something really disturbing about a work of fakery meant to tarnish an entire class of people. You wonder what kind of person would pen such a thing.\n4. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOver 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nOnce again the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstatistic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d more than doubles the actual figures. According to a 2006 story in The Times, there were 41,240 Medi-Cal births to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cundocumented women\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the county in 2004. They accounted for 27% of all births.\nThis time the author more than triples the actual figure. Authorities project some 19,000 of the 172,000 inmates in the California prison system in the 2009-10 fiscal year will be illegal immigrants. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equivalent to 11%.\nA study published last year by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California actually found that U.S.-born men in California are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated than foreign-born men. You can take that statistic with as many grains of salt as you wish.\nThis information apparently comes from a 1987 article in which The Times visited a sampling of properties across the county and looked for unauthorized garage conversions. The story concluded that 200,000 people lived in such dwellings.\nThe story made no effort, however, to determine immigration status. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to point out that just living in an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cillegal garage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make you \\xe2\\x80\\x9can illegal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You might just be a starving artist, or a guy who recently lost his job.\n7. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThis is another \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spun from the 2004 op-ed by Heather Mac Donald, whose article refers to a single Los Angeles gang and the conjecture of an unnamed federal prosecutor.\nThe source of the information may be an Associated Press report from earlier this year. It quoted a government study that found that 0.4% of residents of federally funded public housing are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cineligible noncitizens.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Half of those, or about 0.2% of the total, are illegal immigrants.\nAn annual census survey asks people if they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspeak a language other than English at home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to the most recent report, 3.7 million county residents speak Spanish. But more than half of those Spanish speakers answered that they also speak English \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Only one in 10 Spanish speakers said they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak any English at all.\nObviously, the ability to speak a language other than English, or the desire to listen to Spanish music, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make you an illegal immigrant or a threat to U.S. democracy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a slur against Los Angeles, really, to find these items on a list of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproblems\\xe2\\x80\\x9d caused by illegal immigration.\nThe authors of the chain e-mail and the phony government report fear what Los Angeles has become -- a multilingual, multiethnic city with multicultural tastes.\nThey search for information to persuade others to be afraid, but the actual numbers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite add up to the big monster they think is out there.\nSo they make the numbers bigger. Or they just make them up. And they spread them around until all that fear and anger turns into a big hate.\nHector Tobar worked at the Los Angeles Times for two decades: as a city reporter, national and foreign correspondent, columnist and with the books and culture department.

When this Internet rumor started last year, The Times\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinion website looked into this hoax; here is the link to what they found:.\nOne example of the innacuracies is the claim that a Times story reported that \\xe2\\x80\\x98Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 This appears to misquote information from a May 24, 1987, article about the number of people living in garages in Los Angeles County.

Are 41 percent of them on welfare and are 66 percent of all births in California to undocumented mothers who get free healthcare? Is 60 percent of the housing subsidized by HUD occupied by illegal immigrants? Are 39 percent of students in California illegal immigrants? Are half of the gang members in the United States undocumented residents? The answer is NO to all of those questions: These claims are listed on a meme that has been spreading across social media, but a close examination of facts show that each one is fiction. .\nThe false meme was shared a post (archived here ) published on September 18, 2019 under the title \""Today\\'s illegals are coming here for different reasons than the massive immigration into this country around the turn of the century.......Today too many only come for the payouts......Meanwhile our homeless suffer and we have too many more that need the same benefits.\"" It read: .\nFacts! 1. 43% of all FOOD Stamps are Given to Illegals 2. 95% of Warrants issued for Murder in Los Angeles are for Illegals 3. Less than 2% of Illegals are picking crops but 41% are on Welfare 4.

U.S. Taxpayers are Footing the Bill for ALL .\nFood Stamps are given to needy American families through SNAP -- the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The demographic group getting the largest percentage of SNAP benefits are White American families, which account for 40 percent of those getting food stamps, according to a HuffPo article titled \""Who Gets Food Stamps? White People.\"" .\nSNAP is for legal residents only. You cannot apply for SNAP without a Social Security number. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs SNAP, explains this on their website: .\nOf the 282 murders investigated in Los Angeles in 2017, it is estimated that 63 percent were gang related, with gang members most often being the killers and the killed. Los Angeles Police reported that 104 of the 2017 murders were committed by Hispanic gang members and 95 of their victims were Hispanic. While the Central American-based MS-13 gang is a major player in Los Angeles, it is not the only deadly group. But even if all of the Hispanic gang members who killed illegally in the country, the share of murders would not be 95 percent. The LAPD\\'s annual homicide report, which you can scroll through below, said that of 171 identified suspects, 52 percent were of Hispanic descent, 40 percent were of Black descent, 6 percent were White, and less than 2 percent were Asian. .\nThis supposes that picking crops in the fields is the best place for undocumented immigrants and it implies that it is wrong that just 2 percent wind up there. In fact, a large number of the illegal immigrants do migrate to farms for work. Here\\'s what the New York Times reports in a Dece,ber 11, 2018 story titled \""8 Million People Are Working Illegally in the U.S. Here\\'s Why That\\'s Unlikely to Change\"": .\nUnauthorized immigrants represent about 24 percent of all workers in farming, fishing and forestry and 15 percent of those employed in construction, which is the industry that uses the most undocumented immigrant workers overall, at 1.35 million. .\nDoes this leave 41 percent to collect welfare? No, there is no program entitled \""welfare.\"" The word typically references government benefits to the poor, including food stamps (SNAP), subsidized housing (HUD), and Medicaid (healthcare.) We already debunk the claim about food stamps and the HUD claim will be discussed in the 5th point. This brings us to the 4th. .\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, a non-partisan think that promotes a \""vision which seeks fewer immigrants but a warmer welcome for those admitted,\"" estimated in a report titled \""Births to Legal and Illegal Immigrants in the U.S.\"" that 297,000 babies were born to undocumented mothers in the United States in 2014. About 198,000 of those deliveries were paid for by taxpayers at a cost of about $2.4 billion, CIS estimated. .\nThere were 502,879 babies born in California in 2014. Sixty-six percent of that number is 331,900. Even if all of the publicly-funded births of babies to illegal immigrants were in California (and they were not), it would make up less than 40 percent of the total -- not 66 percent. .\nThe phrase \""HUD occupied properties\"" apparently references housing that is subsidized by the federal government\\'s Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD does own foreclosed properties, which it then resells, but those are not subsidized. An illegal immigrant cannot be on a lease subsidized by HUD, but is allowed to live in the home if another family member who is legal is on the lease. HUD estimates that there are 31,320 undocumented people in so-called \""mixed\"" families in subsidized homes. This data was included in a recent proposal (which is embedded below) through which the Trump administration is changing the rule to prohibit them from occupying the home with their legal relatives. .\nHUD counts 9,573,064 people living in HUD subsidized homes and just 31,320 are illegal immigrants. This is a mere .325 percent of the total, which is exactly 59.675 percent less than 60 percent. .\nA household that has at least one eligible household member, as well as other ineligible household members is called a \""mixed\"" household. Mixed households are currently permitted to live in housing covered by the Section 214 restrictions. However, the amount of assistance they receive is prorated. The rent is adjusted based on the number of household members, the total household income, the number of eligible members of the household and the type of rent subsidy in the covered unit. According to data in HUD databases (see table below), there are approximately 25,000 mixed households having at least one ineligible member.6 Among these mixed households, 71 percent are eligible members, of which 73 percent are children (0-17 years old), 25 percent are adult (18-61 years old), and 2 percent are elderly (62 and over); while 29 percent are ineligible members, of which 93 percent are adult, 5 percent are children, and 2 percent are elderly. Also, the data show that majority of mixed households have 3 eligible members and 1 ineligible member. Geographically, 72 percent of mixed families are concentrated in three states-- California (37 percent), Texas (23 percent), and New York (12 percent)--while the rest is scattered around the country with 3 percent or less mixed families per state. .\nThere are 6,186,278 students in California\\'s public schools, grades K-12 , according to the California Department of Education. There are about 2,200,000 illegal immigrants residing in California, according to the Pew Research Center. If every undocumented resident in California was between the ages of 5 and 12 and they enrolled in a public school, they would be 35 percent of the students. But they are not. Pew reports that 13.3% of California\\'s students have undocumented parents. Many of those students may have been born in the United States, which means they are citizens. The meme\\'s claim is way off. .\nThis is a claim that we have not been able to fully address. One issue is Los Angeles Police do not usually announce the immigration status of a wanted suspect. We will leave this claim unsettled for now, but you can review the Most Wanted list here. .\nThe Justice Department estimates there are 850,000 gang members in about 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs criminally active in the U.S. today. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions estimated that the La Mara Salvatrucha, or \""MS-13,\"" which is believed to be the largest immigrant gang in the United States, has 10,000 members in the country. The Justice Department estimates there are 850,000 gang members in about 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs are criminally active in the U.S. today. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions estimated that the La Mara Salvatrucha, or \""MS-13,\"" which is believed to be the largest immigrant gang in the U.S., has 10,000 members in the country. For the meme claim that half of all gang members are illegal to be true, it would mean there are 425,000 illegal immigrants involved in gangs. That would make MS-13, which is supposed to be the largest immigrant gang, seem very small with just 10,000 member. .\nEditor-in-Chief Alan Duke co-founded Lead Stories after ending a 26-year career with CNN, where he mainly covered entertainment, current affairs and politics.

Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) has a habit of saying some pretty silly things. After the Obama administration decided to treat contraception access as preventive health care, the Pennsylvania Republican said the move was comparable to 9/11 and the attack on Pearl Harbor.Last weekend, Kelly spoke at a local GOP Lincoln Day Dinner in his home state, where the congressman found a new way to complain about the former Democratic president.\n\""President Obama himself said he was going to stay in Washington until his daughter graduated.

The first, which started before 2017 but picked up steam during the past year, was that traditional conservative media, already a conduit for conspiracy theories , became increasingly open to amplifying misinformation from the far-right. The second was that Donald Trump was inaugurated as president -- a man who would embrace conspiracy theories to an extent that no high-ranking public official, much less the president, had ever done. When combined, these developments led to some conspiracy theories, which started off in far corners of the internet, reaching members of the House of Representatives and the White House -- sometimes within a matter of days. Here are a few examples. Obama is operating a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshadow government\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Washington, D.C. .\nIn 2016, then-President Barack Obama leased a home in Washington, D.C. for his family to move into after he left office so his daughter Sasha could finish high school. After the election, Ed Klein, a discredited author known for peddling extremely dubious claims about political figures, claimed on Fox & Friends that Obama and his aides were actually using that new home for \\xe2\\x80\\x9csetting up what they\\'re calling a shadow government,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is \\xe2\\x80\\x9calmost an insurgency,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to oppose Trump once he became president. The claim remained generally dormant until February 2017, when Paul Sperry, a New York Post columnist who was formerly the Washington bureau chief for far-right conspiracy theory outlet WorldNetDaily , published a column claiming that Obama had \\xe2\\x80\\x9can army of agitators\\xe2\\x80\\x9d against Trump whom he would command \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom a bunker less than two miles from the White House,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding it would \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceffectively be a shadow government.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The conspiracy theory spread among far-right and fake news outlets before reaching more traditional right-wing media. Fake news websites further expanded on the conspiracy theory later in the year, suggesting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshadow president\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Obama was violating the Logan Act, a law barring private citizens from interfering with American foreign policy. .\nIn March, Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), speaking at a town hall in his district, said Obama was using his D.C. home \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A spokesperson for Kelly later walked back the conspiratorial remark . Far-right rally in Charlottesville was a liberal set-up .\nIn August, white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville, VA, for a so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnite The Right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rally to protest the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Far-right protesters participated in the rally yielding torches and weapons and chanting bigoted and anti-Semitic slogans ; a man also drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman and injuring at least 19 other people. In an attempt to deflect blame, far-right and fake news outlets pointed to a Southern Law Poverty Center (SPLC) profile of Jason Kessler, who helped organize the rally, and noted that his previous reported support for Obama when he was still president suggested that Kessler was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberal double agent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the rally was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c#falseflag\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c#SorosOp.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A user on the far-right, conspiracy theory-obsessed subreddit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cr/The_Donald\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0 claimed he was the one who found Kessler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SPLC profile and that far-right and fake news outlets had picked up his original post that implied Kessler was a liberal operative. .\nIn September, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) told the San Francisco Chronicle that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cformer \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hillary and Bernie supporter\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d duped \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdumb Civil War re-enactors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d into attending the rally, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cput our president on the spot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The following month, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) told Vice News that Kessler \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas an Obama sympathizer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that the rally \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas created by the Left.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Roy Moore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accusers were bribed and one of them forged Moore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signature .\nOn November 9, The Washington Post reported that multiple women alleged \\xc2\\xa0that then-Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with them when they were teenagers, including one who was 14 years old at the time. Shortly after the Post\\xe2\\x80\\x99 s report was published, Twitter account @umpire43 claimed that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily friend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d told the account\\'s wife that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Far-right and fake news outlets ran with the tweet , even though that account had previously made a similar allegation about two other news outlets and had lied about its own background. Rep. Billy Long (R-MO) subsequently retweeted a November 10 tweet by \\xe2\\x80\\x9calt-right\\xe2\\x80\\x9d-connected figure Mike Tokes that pushed the conspiracy theory. .\nAfter the Post \\xe2\\x80\\x99s report, other women accused Moore of sexual assault, including Beverly Young Nelson, who also said Moore had signed her yearbook. In response, far-right outlet The Gateway Pundit cited discredited figure Thomas Wictor to claim the signature was forged. Shortly afterward, Moore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign also suggested that the signature was forged. Two weeks later, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said in a radio interview that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe evidence is almost incontrovertible about whether the yearbook was forged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump, who endorsed Moore in December, also reportedly told people he believed the signature was likely forged. (During a December 8 interview with ABC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Good Morning America , Nelson explained that she had added a note to Moore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yearbook inscription, which led the conspiracy theorists to falsely claim she had admitted to forging the entire document. News outlets were quick to point out that Moore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handwriting in the yearbook inscription matched another handwriting sample produced by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyet another woman who [said] Moore pursued her when she was in high school.\"") A former Obama official confirmed that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower .\nOn March 2, nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin outlined on his show what he claimed was an Obama administration effort to undermine Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s candidacy during the 2016 election by, among other things, wiretapping Trump Tower. The next day, Breitbart published an article that detailed Levin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims as if they were breaking news. The next day, on March 4, Trump accused Obama of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower, tweeting, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Right-wing and far-right media outlets tried to defend the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s baseless claim , making up false and misleading defenses for it. .\nOn March 28, a YouTube account called The Leaping Frog posted a video that it falsely claimed showed former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas admitting that Obama spied on Trump. Far-right outlets subsequently picked up the video and the claim was eventually aired on Fox News, including on Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favorite morning news show Fox & Friends , all within a span of a few days. Shortly afterward, then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited Farkas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interview to defend Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s false claim. Truck drivers in Puerto Rico were on a strike during relief efforts after Hurricane Maria .\nIn September, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and caused widespread damage , leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity, food or water . The Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to Puerto Rico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plight drew significant criticism and the island is still struggling to recover from the storm. After San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\\xc3\\xadn Cruz criticized the acting secretary of homeland security for calling the administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inadequate hurricane response a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood news story,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump attacked her on Twitter for her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoor leadership.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nOn September 28, a YouTube account called visionrealtyusa com posted a video that it falsely claimed showed a Puerto Rican truck union leader promising to sabotage the relief efforts. Others started sharing the video on social media, and far-right and fake news outlets cited the video and other Twitter users to claim Puerto Rican truck drivers were on strike.

It notes how the DNC was better for local businesses than the pope and contains plenty about the soda tax and the upcoming education initiatives it will fund. But the report first discusses crime, consistently one of the biggest concerns for Philadelphians who flirt with leaving the city.\n\""While many urban areas across the country saw a sharp increase in crime over the last year,\"" the report reads, \""the Philadelphia Police Department successfully lowered part one crimes and increased drug seizures.\"".\nSo what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part one crime, and did Philly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part one crime rate drop? And did other cities have difficulty keeping their overall crimes rates low? We decided to check. And for fun we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look into how this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change in the crime rate compares to the years of former Mayor Michael Nutter.\nFirst, Philly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crime rate. Part one crimes are defined by the Uniform Crime Reporting Act as forcible rape, homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson. The mayor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report states that of part one crimes as of Dec. 11, homicide is down 1 percent, burglaries are down 14 percent, reports of rape down 10 percent and robberies down 8 percent.\nThe administration said it obtained its data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Act. If you look at year-to-date statistics directly from the police department on Dec. 11, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re slightly different. Homicide, for instance, was up 2 percent. But either way, part one crime was down 1 percent on Dec. 11 and violent part one crime was down about 5 percent,\\xc2\\xa0 according to statistics from the police.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe decrease follows a years-long trend for Philadelphia. Under the Nutter administration,\\xc2\\xa0 violent crime decreased about 20 percent \\xc2\\xa0from when he took office in 2008 to the end of 2015. Most of the decrease took place in his last four years, but Philly experienced a slight decrease in violent crime in his first year before slight increases the next three years. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\nNot every city can tell the same story as Philadelphia about a reduction in crime and violent crime this year. Throughout 2016,\\xc2\\xa0 national publications have hyped \\xc2\\xa0a rise in violent crime, particularly murder rates, for reasons unclear to experts. Among big cities that have experienced a surge in violent crime are Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles. As of last week, Dallas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 part one crime rate had increased .1 percent and Los Angeles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 5.4 percent. Nearby big cities like New York and Baltimore have seen a decrease in part one crime, like Philadelphia, according to statistics from their police departments.\nA recent study \\xc2\\xa0by the Brennan Center looked at 21 of the 30 largest U.S. cities and compared projections of crime rates from 2016 to 2015, based on numbers it collected in September. It found the projected crime rate up 1.3 percent overall, a projection the Brennan Center described as \""nearly unchanged,\"" the violent crime rate up 5.5 percent and the murder rate up 13.1 percent. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe Brennan Center notes most of the fluctuations in the crime rate fall within expected ranges and there has been no national wave of crime. The main reasons for stories about an unclear increase in murder and violent crime nationally are outliers like Chicago and San Antonio, which have seen their murder rates go up about 47 percent and 50 percent, respectively, this year. For overall crime rate, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Antonio, Charlotte and Oklahoma City were the only cities with increases in crime above 4 percent.\nPhiladelphia is one of 13 of the 21 cities to experience a reduction in total crime and one of eight to see a reduction in violent crime. .\n \""It is shocking to me that Police Commissioner Richard Ross and Mayor Jim Kenney allowed this illegal occupation to go on for hours without taking any action to enforce the law\u2026\"" .\n \""Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility.

He has office space paid for by the General Services Administration, a perk granted to all former presidents. According to the Chicago Sun Times , Obama is the first president since Woodrow Wilson to stay at a primary residence in Washington, D.C. after his tenure ended.\nObama will be assisting former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a Congressional redistricting effort, work Holder has described as a \""going into the states\"" strategy. Holder also said Obama would be fundraising and interacting with state legislators. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\nNo reports or intelligence has been released linking these post-presidency activities of Obama to a shadow government. And Kelly did not provide any evidence. A shadow government is commonly defined as a conflicting, secondary government led by members of the private sector that wields similar influence to the actual government.\nKelly later withdrew his comments after they made national news. His spokesperson Tom Qualtere said, \""Because of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government.\"" In another statement, Qualtere said, \""he was sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s agenda.\"".\nKelly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments and his ensuing walkback landed in The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, The Hill and MSNBC.

It reads, \u201cThe government pays out \u201c$2,125/month in refugee benefits to refugees resettled in the United States,\u201d while Social Security recipients \u201cwho have paid into the system their whole lives receive $1,400/month on average.\u201d .\nThis is misleading as Social Security income in the United States varies from person to person. Retirement Living reports (here) that \""your Social Security benefit payment is based on a sliding scale that accounts for your income, how many years you worked\"" and when a person begins collecting benefit payments. .\nMore information about social security income is available on the Social Security Administration\u00a0s website (here) . A fact sheet on the average amount of retirement pay ($1,555) for social security benefits for 2021 is visible here . .\nThe National Immigration Forum, an immigration advocacy group (here) , said refugees, are defined as \""persons outside the country of his or her nationality, who are unable or unwilling to return to their countries due to persecution or fear of persecution based on various factors such as race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion.\u201d .\nThe United States provides humanitarian entry into the country for refugees and asylum seekers and is made possible by the Refugee Act of 1980 (here) . Based on a factsheet seen here by the Immigration Forum, funding for refugee resettlement is made possible by a partnership of the Department of State and the Department of Health and Human Services. .\nThe funds are loaned to the refugee to cover travel expenses. The State Department\u2019s Reception and Placement (R&P) program stipulates that repayment must be made after arrival. .\n\""The R&P program then supplies resettlement agencies a one-time sum per refugee to finance their first 30-90 days in the U.S. That money goes mostly towards rent, furnishings, food, and clothing, as well as costs of the agency staff case management and other integration services.\"" (here) .\nThe details of the program were confirmed to Reuters by a spokesperson from the U.S. State Department press office. The program is managed by the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM), the Reception & Placement (R&P) Program, the representative said. The funding only provides initial support for 30 to 90 days to help refugees begin their new lives in the United States. .\nA one-time per capita amount of $2,275 is provided to the resettlement agencies, of which about $1,225 is available for agencies to use to fund critical direct assistance needs such as housing and necessities, including food, clothing, and furnishings. .\nThe State Department official told Reuters the only direct assistance paid to a refugee is the one-time $1,225 payment and is only provided directly to refugees in the rare event that they have established family or friend relationships who are able to meet their basic needs such as housing. .\nThe State Department spokesperson said that many partnerships work through state and non-governmental organizations to \u201cprovide longer-term cash and medical assistance.\u201d .\nSupport is also available in English language and employment benefits, food assistance, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and SSI. More on resettlement assistance is reviewable on the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services site seen here . .\nMissing Context. Based on information from U.S. government officials, refugee resettlement funds are not paid monthly and do not exceed the average social security benefits paid to American retirees. .\n SC bench dissolved as Justice Aminuddin recuses himself from hearing elections case SC (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023 sails through Senate Fawad all praise for LHC for striking down sedition law IHC reserves verdict on admissibility of Tyrian White case Imran Khan moves LHC for dismissal of all cases against him Dar avoids giving timeline for deal with IMF in Senate speech Twitter blocks Pakistan govt\\'s account for viewing in India Pak Navy\\'s display of firing surface-to-air missiles .\n Programs Dunya Kamran Khan Kay Sath Hasb-e-Haal Mazaq Raat On The Front Think Tank Nuqta E Nazar Peyam-E-Subh Voice of Dunya Ilm-O-Hikmat Dunya TV Special Sawal Awam Ka Ikhtalafi Note \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t."", ""evidence"": ""(Reuters) - Claims on social media that refugees entering the United States receive $2,125 per month while social security recipients only receive an average monthly payment of $1,400 are inaccurate."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.93721145""}, {""snippet"": ""<b> \\tInstagram posts:\\xc2\\xa0The government pays out \""$2,125/month in refugee benefits to refugees resettled in the United States,\"" while Social Security recipients \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho have paid into the system their whole lives receive $1,400/month on average.\""</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.stripersonline.com/surftalk/topic/863837-refugees-getting-paid-more-than-your-avg-social-security-recipient/"", ""title"": ""\""Refugees\"" getting paid more than your avg social security recipient - Political Graffiti - SurfTalk"", ""full_text"": "" \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t All Content \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t All Content This Topic This Forum Advanced Search \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJoin StripersOnline! \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMember Login \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSurfTalk \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tForums \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSearch \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAmazon Shopping \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLeaderboard \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGallery \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGuidelines \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStripersOnline Home \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBuying/Selling Guidelines \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStaff \\t\\t\\t\\t More \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tActivity \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAll Activity \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUnread Content - by Topic \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSearch \\t\\t\\t\\t More More More.\n \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 0 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t Go to top \\t\\t \\t \\t.\n \\t\\t\\t Share this post \\t\\t\\t Link to post Share on other sites \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t .\n \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 9 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t Go to top \\t\\t \\t \\t.\n \\t\\t\\t Share this post \\t\\t\\t Link to post Share on other sites \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t giant basshole \\t\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 BST Users Location: Bikini Bottom.\n \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 0 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t Go to top \\t\\t \\t \\t.\n \\t\\t\\t Share this post \\t\\t\\t Link to post Share on other sites \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Gotcow? \\t\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 BST Users.\n \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 2 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t Go to top \\t\\t \\t \\t.\n \\t\\t\\t Share this post \\t\\t\\t Link to post Share on other sites \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t  ...evidence too long",0

Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan), who requested IBO crunch the numbers, told The Post. .\nMSG\u2019s official fair market value is just $867 million despite its location in the heart of Manhattan \u2014 compared to $2.6 billion for Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, as well as $3.2 billion for Citi Field in Queens, the analysis notes. .\nAll three outer-borough venues also sit on tax-exempt public land, but they are on the hook for so-called \u201cPayments in Lieu of Taxes\u201d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 totaling $84 million, $44 million, and $39 million this year, respectively \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to service debts on tax-exempt bonds used to finance their constructions. .\nThe IBO report adds that \u201cthere is general agreement within the field of economics that substantial government subsidies for sports facilities are not typically an efficient use of scarce public resources,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the report said. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is little evidence that these types of subsidies generate sufficient economic activity to lead to a net fiscal benefit to the local area.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nA MSG Entertainment spokesperson told The Post Wednesday that the analysis \u201cclearly illustrates what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said all along \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of New York City\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major sports venues benefit from public subsidies, and as the analysis clearly indicates, MSG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is one of the smallest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nAn effort to repeal the tax exemption is one of several fights between MSG CEO James Dolan and state officials.

Five of these companies also got benefits from the paycheck protection program, totaling more than $30m.\nDespite this, almost every one of the fossil-fuel companies laid off workers, with a more than 58,000 people losing their jobs since the onset of the pandemic, or around 16% of the combined workforces.\nHowever, in the year to December 2020, the Ohio-based refining company laid off 1,920 workers, or around 9% of its workforce. As a comparative ratio, Marathon has received around $1m for each worker it made redundant, according to BailoutWatch, a nonprofit advocacy group that analyzed Securities and Exchange Commission filings to compile all the data .\nPhillips 66, Vistra Corp, National Oilwell Varco and Valero were the next largest beneficiaries of the tax-code changes, with all of them shedding jobs in the past year. In the case of National Oilwell Varco, a Houston-headquartered drilling supply company, 22% of the workforce was fired, despite federal government tax assistance amounting to $591m.\nChart showing how much bail out money oil and gas companies received and how many jobs they cut from December 2019 to December 2020.\nOther major oil and gas companies including Devon Energy and Occidental Petroleum also took in major pandemic tax benefits in the last year while also shedding thousands of workers.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not surprised that these companies took advantage of these tax benefits, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m horrified by the layoffs after they got this money,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Chris Kuveke, a researcher at BailoutWatch.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stimulus was about keeping the economy going, but these companies didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use these resources to retain their workers. These are companies that are polluting the environment, increasing the deadliness of the pandemic and letting go of their workers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe tax benefits stems from a change in the Cares Act from March last year that allowed companies that had made a loss since 2013 to use this to offset their taxes, receiving this refund as a payment.\nThe extended carry-back benefit was embraced by the oil and gas industry, with many companies suffering losses even before Covid-19 hit. Pandemic shutdowns then severely curtailed travel by people for business or pleasure, dealing a major blow to fossil-fuel companies through the plummeting use of oil, with the price of a barrel of oil even entering negative territory at one point last year .\nA spokesman for Marathon, the one company to answer questions on the layoffs, said the business made \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe very difficult decision\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to reduce its workforce, providing severance and extended healthcare benefits to those affected.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese difficult decisions were part of a broader, comprehensive effort, which also included implementing strict capital discipline and overall expense management to lower our cost structure, to improve the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resiliency, and re-position it for long-term success,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the spokesman said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe look forward to better days ahead for everyone as the nation emerges from the pandemic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThis expense management didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t extend to the pay of Marathon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief executive, Michael Hennigan, who made $15.5m in 2020. According to BailoutWatch, Marathon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief executive is paid 99 times the average company worker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s salary.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey had no problem paying their executives for good performance when they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t perform well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kuveke. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no problem with working Americans retaining their jobs but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe we should subsidize an industry that has been supported by the government for the past 100 years. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to stop subsidizing them and start facing the climate crisis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nFaced by growing political and societal pressure in their role in the climate crisis and the deaths of millions of people each year through air pollution, the oil and gas industry has sought to paint itself as the protector of thousands of American workers who face joblessness due to Joe Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s climate policies.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTargeting specific industries with new taxes would only undermine the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic recovery and jeopardize good-paying jobs, including union jobs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Frank Macchiarola, senior vice-president for policy, economic and regulatory affairs at lobby group American Petroleum Institute, following Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement of a new climate-focused infrastructure plan on Wednesday.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to note that our industry receives no special tax treatment, and we will continue to advocate for a tax code that supports a level playing field for all economic sectors along with policies that sustain and grow the billions of dollars in government revenue that we help generate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nHelp Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Search UK jobs."", ""evidence"": ""This article is more than 1 year old US fossil-fuel companies took billions in tax breaks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then laid off thousands."", ""nli_class"": ""neutral"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9850109""}, {""snippet"": ""With just two weeks\\xc2\\xa0till this year\u2019s April 18 tax filing deadline, many\\xc2\\xa0Americans are still sweating over their 1040s, Schedule A\u2019s and self-employment tax worksheets. <b>One reason they might put\\xc2\\xa0in\\xc2\\xa0a little\\xc2\\xa0extra time: the more than $1.3 trillion worth of tax breaks that are allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/06/the-biggest-u-s-tax-breaks/"", ""title"": ""The biggest U.S. tax breaks | Pew Research Center"", ""full_text"": ""Asia & the Pacific Europe & Russia Latin America Middle East & North Africa North America Sub-Saharan Africa Multiple Regions / Worldwide \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.\nPolitics & Policy International Affairs Immigration & Migration Race & Ethnicity Religion Generations & Age Gender & LGBTQ Family & Relationships Economy & Work Science Internet & Technology News Habits & Media Methodological Research Full topic list \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\tRegions & Countries \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t.\nAsia & the Pacific Europe & Russia Latin America Middle East & North Africa North America Sub-Saharan Africa Multiple Regions / Worldwide \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\tFormats \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t.\nWith just two weeks\\xc2\\xa0till this year\u2019s April 18 tax filing deadline, many\\xc2\\xa0Americans are still sweating over their 1040s, Schedule A\u2019s and self-employment tax worksheets. One reason they might put\\xc2\\xa0in\\xc2\\xa0a little\\xc2\\xa0extra time: the more than $1.3 trillion worth of tax breaks that are allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. .\nThat\u2019s the total estimated impact for fiscal year 2016 of the nearly\\xc2\\xa0200 major \u201ctax expenditures\u201d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 government lingo for tax breaks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that come in the form of exemptions, deductions, credits and other special provisions, according to an annual staff report from Congress\u2019\\xc2\\xa0 Joint Committee on Taxation . Even that $1.3 trillion figure is an understatement, as the report only gives specifics for a tax expenditure\\xc2\\xa0if it\u2019s estimated to cost the government $50 million or more per year; dozens of breaks\\xc2\\xa0fall below that threshold. .\nTax expenditures are defined as departures from \u201cnormal\u201d income-tax law that benefit particular individuals and businesses. They include everything from the favorable tax treatment of employer-paid health insurance (estimated to cost the government a total of $769.8 billion over five years) to a tax credit for economic development in American Samoa\\xc2\\xa0(estimated five-year cost: less than $50 million). .\nMost tax breaks specified in the report benefit individuals rather than corporations. We counted 118 individual breaks with a net total estimated cost in fiscal 2016 of nearly $1.15 trillion, compared with 80\\xc2\\xa0corporate breaks totaling $185.2 billion. More than half of that corporate total comes from one break, the deferral of taxes on income earned overseas through foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. (Bear in mind that, as we\u2019ve noted before , the corporate income tax brings in far less revenue than the individual income tax does.) .\nThe biggest individual tax break was for employer-paid health care, health insurance and long-term care insurance, none of which is counted as taxable income. That provision cost the government an estimated $145.5 billion last fiscal year, and is estimated to cost $143.8 billion this year. Taxing dividends and capital gains at lower rates than ordinary income will keep an estimated $134.6 billion out of the Treasury in the current fiscal year. The controversial\\xc2\\xa0mortgage-interest deduction will cost $77 billion this fiscal year, while the accompanying deduction for local property tax payments will cost another\\xc2\\xa0$34.7 billion. .\nEconomists and tax analysts tend to use the term \u201ctax expenditures\u201d because such special-purpose breaks\\xc2\\xa0are effectively the same as direct spending \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Congress can appropriate\\xc2\\xa0$150 billion for health care or provide an indirect subsidy worth $150 billion through the tax code. While it\u2019s often politically easier to enact a tax break than a new appropriation, financing social programs through tax policy affects both how those\\xc2\\xa0programs function and who benefits from them.\\xc2\\xa0For example, a recent study of federal tax credits for higher education (which will cost an estimated $21 billion this fiscal year) concluded that most of the benefits go to middle- and upper-income households, and appear to\\xc2\\xa0have little impact on whether students go to college at all or what kind of schools they attend. .\nBut\\xc2\\xa0simply repealing, say, the exclusion for employer-paid health benefits\\xc2\\xa0wouldn\u2019t necessarily automatically add $143.8\\xc2\\xa0billion to federal revenues, since taxpayers might be able to take advantage of other breaks hidden in the tax code. (In valuing\\xc2\\xa0each specific tax break, the Joint Committee staff\\xc2\\xa0assumed that if it\\xc2\\xa0were repealed affected taxpayers could and would claim the next-best tax treatment, but they did not try\\xc2\\xa0to incorporate any other behavioral changes that might result from the repeal.) .\nWhile not all tax breaks mainly benefit the well-off, many do. For instance, taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or above receive more than 80% of the value of the mortgage-interest and property-tax deductions, according to Joint Committee estimates; more than two-thirds of the value of the deduction for charitable contributions goes to taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 or more. .\nLow-income people, who pay relatively little income tax, can\u2019t take full advantage of many breaks. One exception is\\xc2\\xa0the earned-income tax credit, or EITC, which is aimed at assisting low- to moderate-income workers and their families. Unlike most tax credits, the EITC is refundable, meaning that if a taxpayer owes less tax than the credit is worth, he or she receives the excess amount as a refund. The report estimates that more than 80 percent of the value of the EITC goes to taxpayers with $40,000 or less in income. .\nAlthough all the remaining 2016 presidential candidates have released tax-reform plans , tax policy hasn\u2019t generally been front and center during the campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps because it\u2019s not an especially high priority for the public. In a Pew Research Center survey earlier this year, Americans ranked tax reform far behind strengthening the economy, defending\\xc2\\xa0against terrorism and improving the educational system as top priorities for the federal government\\xc2\\xa0this year. .\nStill, Americans are hardly fans of the existing system.\\xc2\\xa0In a\\xc2\\xa0 survey we did last year , 59% said there\u2019s so much wrong with the tax system that Congress should completely change it (versus 38% who said only minor changes are needed). While that sentiment was\\xc2\\xa0more partisan than\\xc2\\xa0the last time we asked the question, in 2011, even half of self-identified liberal Democrats favored completely changing the system. .\nshort read | Apr 30, 2021 Top tax frustrations for Americans: The feeling that some corporations, wealthy people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay fair share \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.\n5 A Look Back at How Fear and False Beliefs Bolstered U.S. Public Support for War in Iraq \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t.\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington , DC 20036 USA \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.\nAbout Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

If companies wanted to lay off thousands of employees, \u201ctax reform\u201d allowed them to do it. Or companies could pocket the money and\\xc2\\xa0 boost their stock price . They could also simply offshore the jobs\\xc2\\xa0to Asia. .\nWell, all those things happened. Within weeks of the tax bill passing, America\u2019s largest corporations started laying off workers. By February 2018, it became a feeding frenzy, with one company laying off over 5,000 employees \\xc2\\xa0for \u201crestructuring.\u201d .\nSince then, it has continued looking like a bad deal for workers.\\xc2\\xa0 Here are 17 U.S. companies that laid off large numbers of employees after taking Trump\u2019s\\xc2\\xa0 tax cuts.\\xc2\\xa0 1. Pfizer .\nIf you need a summary of the state of U.S. healthcare, simply check the plans Pfizer announced in January 2018. According to Reuters, the\\xc2\\xa0company valued at $53 billion cut 300 research jobs in New England. .\nThose employees conducted tests on drugs aimed at treating Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Pfizer, which will continue onward with drugs like Viagra, is set to save billions from Trump\u2019s tax cuts. .\n\u201cAT&T plans to increase U.S. capital spending $1 billion and provide $1,000 special bonus to more than 200,000 U.S. employees, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of what we did,\u201d Trump told the nation in December 2017. .\nThat same night, hundreds of AT&T employees in Missouri learned they were being fired just in time for Christmas. Trump did not comment on that development, but the local union president did. .\n\u201cHow can you lay people off and then give them $1,000 and say that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be more jobs available?\u201d asked Joseph Blanco of the\\xc2\\xa0Communication Workers of America Union. .\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot of General Motors CEO Mary Barra in the White House since the 2016 election. While she\u2019s made those appearances with Trump, GM has been one of the companies that offshored the most U.S. jobs . .\nAfter the tax cuts passed, GM also announced it would be laying off another\\xc2\\xa0 1,500 employees in Ohio . Meanwhile, the automaker has appeared to sour on Trump administration policies. .\nKimberly-Clark, the $42 billion company behind Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissues, said it would shut down 10 factories and lay off between 5,000 and 5,500 workers in 2018. The Dallas-based company spoke in terms of global strategy about the move, which affects 13% of its employees. .\n\u201cWe anticipate ongoing annual cash flow benefits from tax reform,\u201d CFO Maria Henry said. Henry added that Kimberly-Clark could now \u201callocate significant capital to shareholders\u201d during its restructuring program. .\nSo shareholders will see more money while workers get pink slips. These jobs won\u2019t come back, and businesses near the shuttered factories will also feel the impact. .\nComcast, the very unpopular $199 billion company, stood to gain over $12 billion in a single year from Trump\u2019s tax cuts. Yet the corporation quietly fired over 500 sales employees \\xc2\\xa0right before Christmas 2017. .\nInstead of a bonus, Comcast said the $1,000 it mentioned in press releases would serve as severance for laid-off employees. However, we learned its real goal with tax reform funds in January 2018. .\nComcast raised stockholder dividend payouts 21% and announced $5 billion in stock buybacks. Compared to the $171 million it spent on employee bonuses, the cable giant spent 30 times the amount on shareholders. .\nIn February 2017, Harley-Davidson executives and employees brought several motorcycles to the White House as Trump posed for pictures with them, touting the return of American manufacturing. One year (and one 40% tax cut) later, Harley announced it would close its Kansas City plant and lay off 800 workers there. .\nThe massive layoffs did not come off like a White House photo op, however. \u201cThey didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even give us a call ahead of time,\u201d a union representative told The Kansas City Star. Harley is opening a plant in Thailand \\xc2\\xa0for 2018, so it isn\u2019t hard to see what happened. .\nNext : America\u2019s biggest employer didn\u2019t hesitate to lay off thousands of workers after securing its tax plan windfall. 7. Walmart .\nWith Walmart, the country\u2019s biggest employer, seemed taken aback by the massive tax cuts. First, we heard the company\u2019s decision to raise the minimum wage for some employees and give bonuses to others. .\nThat PR move made it all the way to the White House, and Trump celebrated. However, bad news came on the same day. .\nOn January 11, the company abruptly closed 63 of its Sam\u2019s Club stores , affecting thousands of employees. The company said some employees could find work in other locations; others wouldn\u2019t. Somehow, the company\u2019s newfound billions weren\u2019t enough to protect some low-wage jobs. .\nWhen all the layoffs are tallied, Citibank may have cut the most jobs of any U.S. company. You may recall the bank receiving $476 billion in cash and guarantees from the Treasury during its 2008 bailout. .\nAfter another massive windfall from the GOP tax plan, the bank said it would likely be cutting 10,000 jobs in the coming years. .\nAmong the big U.S. companies laying off workers in 2018, McDonald\u2019s may have taken the most clever approach. Instead of giving a number of employees it would let go, the corporation\u2019s president said it would be \u201c eliminating layers \u201d within the organization, The Wall Street Journal Reported in June 2018. .\nIn a company as big as McDonald\u2019s, the number is sure to be in the thousands. Meanwhile, on Wall Street, investors \u201ccheered\u201d the news. .\nWhen a corporation decides it can save money by laying off employees, it usually uses words like \u201crestructuring.\u201d That\u2019s exactly how Hewlett-Packard phrased it when announcing it would drop 5,000 workers by the end of 2019. .\nIf you\u2019re keeping score at home, that means a company that now pays 40% less in taxes will lay off 10% of its workforce. .\nFirst, the company announced it would raise the number of jobs it was eliminating from 1,300 to 2,000 employees , with several hundred coming at Detroit Medical Center. The following day, the company\u2019s stock price began a climb that left shares up 25% within two weeks. .\nWhen people warned that CEOs would simply take the extra millions from tax reform and give it to top shareholders, they were probably referring to this type of scenario. .\nYou may remember the Carrier episode from December 2016 in a few different ways. For Trump and Vice President Pence, it was a victory as the company got a $7 million tax break in exchange for keeping a few hundred jobs in Indiana. .\nThose who worked inside the plant saw it a different way: as a PR spectacle that meant nothing when it came to saving jobs. .\nOne year later, with its corporate tax rate slashed, Carrier laid off 215 employees in January 2018. Those jobs went directly to Mexico, where workers will earn $3 per hour, Reuters reported. .\nIt has been rather difficult for Tesla CEO Elon Musk to admit fault over the years. However, when the company announced it would be laying off 9% of its workforce in June, that was clearly a management problem. .\nAll told, at least 3,600 workers found themselves unemployed following the news. The botched rollout of the Model 3 sedan played a huge part in this move. .\nWhen you\u2019re Microsoft, a tech giant with a market cap over $700 billion, the GOP tax plan was music to your ears. After all, Microsoft could repatriate $128 billion to the U.S. at discount tax rates. .\nIf Indiana workers didn\u2019t like the deal Trump and Vice President Mike Pence made with Carrier, maybe they hoped for better from European company Schneider Electric. After all, foreign investors were set to pocket $70 billion \\xc2\\xa0in just one year under the tax plan. .\nUnfortunately, in yet another sign capital investment and taxes are unrelated, Schneider announced 61 workers at an Indiana facility would lose their jobs in 2018. .\nWhen you hear of a company with a $204 billion market cap letting 53 employees go , you have to really worry about its state of affairs. If so, direct your concerns toward Coca Cola, the beverage giant that took its tax cut and laid off dozens of employees from a Georgia plant. .\nReductions in the corporate tax rate (now down to 21%) allow Coke executives to play with billions, but these low-wage jobs could not be saved. .\nFinally, we close with Dunkin\u2019 brands, a company with a $6 billion market cap. In total, the company said it would eliminate 40 jobs that are currently filled and leave another 40 unfilled jobs that way around the globe. .\nApparently, those millions in saved taxes won\u2019t help the company keep its U.S. employees \u2014 or fill jobs that it had staffed in the past.

Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it.\nJorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified\\xc2\\xa0two reasons.\nOne is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recently created Energy Commission.\nOne of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt.\n \""We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just burning 300 gallons of jet fuel to de-ice this clean energy wind turbine \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that needs 80 gallons of synthetic oil to operate.\"" .\nBefore the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma.\nBut coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout . The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months.\n\""PREPA was in bankruptcy,\"" Carmacho said. \""That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.

She told lawmakers she was removed in a smear campaign by those with \""questionable intentions\"".\nJustifying his decision to oust her, the president told Fox & Friends last Friday he heard \""bad things\"" about \""the ambassador, the woman\"".\n\""This was not an angel, this woman, okay? And there were a lot of things that she did that I didn't like.\"".\nMr Trump added that his staff felt they had to be kind because \""she's a woman - we have to be nice.\"".\n\""One of the things that's interesting about women and language is that women are 'marked'.\"" Men, she notes, are not usually referred to as a \""male person\"".\n\""But we find it often easy and useful to describe a person first and foremost as a woman.

You don't often say he's a male politician.\"".\n\""So in saying a female politician - before you've said anything else about her policies, her credentials, her professional standing - you've said a lot.\"".\nEven before he became president, Mr Trump had a history of controversial comments about women. His comments in a 2005 Access Hollywood tape about grabbing women \""by the pussy\"" are perhaps the most notorious, and made headlines in 2016.\nDebbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutger's University, says these latest remarks are part of a pattern.\n\""The kind of things that he said about Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina, Elizabeth Warren, Heidi Cruz - the list goes on - he talks about women, any prominent, powerful woman, in the most demeaning of ways, trivialising them.\"".\nOn Friday, Mr Trump told Fox & Friends his adviser Kellyanne Conway was great, but \""must have done some number\"" on her husband, George, who is a Trump critic.\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Grisham's predecessor too, was a woman - Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\nWhen challenged on his attitude to women, Mr Trump has in the past pointed to his record in recruiting and promoting women in his companies. \""I love women,\"" he proclaims.\nHis 2020 campaign is led by Brad Parscale, but according to Politico, the highest levels of the campaign team include over a dozen women as senior advisers and directors.\nThe BBC reached out to Women For Trump, one of the biggest pro-Trump women's political groups, for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\nBut she says she doesn't mind. She and other conservative women in Virginia, Pennsylvania and other states say there are more important issues than the president's remarks.\nThey applaud the way he has helped bring down unemployment among women and appreciates how he has fought against abortion through the appointment of conservative judges.\nIn addition, Jordan and other Republicans like the way he has hired women such as Kellyanne Conway, a counsellor to the president, for high-profile roles: \""He has put women in very important places,\"" Jordan says.\nJordan attests to the fact that despite the controversial way the president talks about women, many of them still adore him and will vote for him again in 2020.\n\""It's always about demeaning men in order to make them less tough, less strong, in many ways, less masculine,\"" says Ms Walsh.\n\""He's also pumping himself up as the uber-masculine figure at the expense of the men who are challenging him in any way.\"".\nOne of his favourites to level at male opponents is \""little\"" - Little Marco Rubio, Little Michael Bloomberg, Little Adam Schiff, Little Rocket Man.\nProf LaFrance notes: \""Once you've referred to a person's size or standing as small or little, then you're trafficking in the realm of gender terminology.\"".\nFor Ms Walsh, though Mr Trump does not discriminate in criticising men and women who oppose him, the attacks on women are more dangerous.\nShe says the instance where Mr Trump singled out four freshmen Democratic congresswomen of colour and told them to \""go home\"" was particularly \""threatening\"".\n\""We know women are often targeted on the political front, threatened certainly online, and singling them out and using very loaded language about those four women was one of the most egregious things.\"".\nPew analysis of his first two years in office found his average approval rating to be 44% among men and 31% among women - the widest gap between genders since the George H W Bush presidency.\nAnd while Mr Trump found success with white women voters in 2016, he may find it more difficult to win them this time around, according to recent polling.\nMs Walsh says Mr Trump could see real challenges in winning over white, college educated, suburban women who are typically Republicans \""in part because of this language, this behaviour and the way he treats women\"".\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

But in prior years, he has called himself \""very pro-choice.\"" So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy for Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opponents on either side of the issue to criticize his position.\nAlong the same lines, Boxer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that Trump said women should be \""punished\"" for having an abortion is a selective reading of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments, which have shifted. He did say that women should be punished for having an abortion, but he walked back his comments the very same day.\nTrump made the comments at issue during a March 30, 2016, conversation with MSNBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chris Matthews. Here are two relevant portions of the conversation. ( Read more here. ).\nMATTHEWS: \""If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under law. Should abortion be punished?\"".\nTRUMP: \""I would say that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very serious problem. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem that we have to decide on.

But he quickly walked back those comments.\nAfter an outcry about his remarks that same day, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign released a statement saying he meant that the person who performed the abortion would face consequences if Congress passed a law banning the procedure.\n\""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb.\"".\nIn a March 31 Fox News interview, Trump said it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible he \""misspoke\"" in his conversation with Matthews, adding that it had been a \""convoluted discussion.\"".\n\""If, in fact, abortion was outlawed, the person performing the abortion, the doctor or whoever it may be that is really doing the act is responsible for the act, not the woman is responsible,\"" Trump said. \""So, that\\'s the way I have always felt.\"".\nAs our friends at Snopes have noted, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like Trump is or was a forceful advocate for punishing women for abortion who then flipped his position suddenly. Trump was responding to a hypothetical question that Matthews posed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a question he first tried to dodge \\xe2\\x80\\x94 about laws banning abortion that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t currently exist. He retracted the comment soon after.\nTrump did say something to this effect, but within a matter of hours, he clarified his comments. Trump said he meant doctors should be punished for providing abortions, not women who undergo the procedure.\nIn rating this claim, we find Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments contradictory. Yes, he mentioned punishment, but his campaign retracted that statement. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no evidence this was a long-held position.\n Says Barack Obama found out about Russia \""in August.

The stimulus package provided\\xc2\\xa0 temporary economic relief , including the expansion of unemployment eligibility and a nationwide weekly unemployment bonus, to support the worsening economy.\nA page on Facebook critiqued the expansion of unemployment benefits. A post said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnemployment now pays $24/hour even if your wages were lower. Why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x98essential\\xe2\\x80\\x99 people forced to still work get $24 too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nKarl W. Smith , a former assistant professor of economics at the University of North Carolina and vice president for federal policy at the Tax Foundation, in an opinion column for Bloomberg said the new unemployment benefits are too generous, put more pressure on the remaining essential workers and may cause resentment from lesser-paid essential workers.\nJosh Bivens , the Economic Policy Institute\\'s director of research,\\xc2\\xa0and\\xc2\\xa0Heidi Shierholz, a former U.S. Department of Labor chief economist, in a blog post for the EPI argued that the act contains \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome good provisions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but provides relief for industries that are too nonspecific and time-bound.\nThe CARES Act includes a $600-a-week bonus until July 31 for those registered as unemployed. The $600 is issued in addition to the standard unemployment benefit, which varies by state and by individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 record of previous earnings.\nThe Facebook claim that the unemployed will now receive $24 an hour is likely about this sizable bonus because the bill does not implement an hourly rate of compensation for the unemployed.\nIn addition to the bonus, the bill\\xc2\\xa0temporarily expanded eligibility for unemployment. The self-employed, gig economy workers, part-time workers and contract workers now qualify for unemployment. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance will provide 39 weeks of benefits for those who file for unemployment between Jan. 27 and Dec. 31.\nThe $600 bonus was\\xc2\\xa0 a compromise\\xc2\\xa0between Democrats \\xc2\\xa0and Republicans, according to Politico. Because the weekly $600 equals $15 an hour for 40 hours, some people will be paid more during unemployment than when they were working.\nAccording to a report by the Leadership Conference Fund and the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality , 42.4% of people working in the United States in 2015 earned less than $15 an hour.\\xc2\\xa0.\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in March on Fox News \\xc2\\xa0that the $600 bonus was chosen because states\\' computer systems are more than 30 years old. Reprogramming the computers to achieve what he described as a more nuanced distribution of money\\xc2\\xa0would have taken too long.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn certain states, that might be a little bit too much money. In other states, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less money. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a perfect system, but the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objective was to make sure we get money in people\\'s hands,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mnuchin said.\nThe Facebook claim fails to mention that unemployment benefits vary from state to state. Unemployment benefits are administered at the state level with federal oversight.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also mentioned the supposed $24-an-hour unemployment payment, arguing the aid will force employers to compete with the higher pay.\nThe Congressional Research Service in October 2019 recorded the maximum weekly unemployment compensation in South Carolina at $326. When added to the $600, compensation is equivalent to $23.15 an hour, close to what Graham said.\nBut other states\\xe2\\x80\\x99 maximum unemployment compensation is lower. In Arizona, the maximum weekly unemployment compensation is $240, which would equal $21 an hour.\nMassachusetts has the highest maximum weekly unemployment compensation at $1,192 (the state provides extra funding for people with dependents) and Puerto Rico holds the lowest at $190.\nAccording to data obtained by PolitiFact , at the national level, unemployment covers about half of a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wages at up to $450 a week, which comes out to about $225 a week.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, a person who normally earns $450 would receive $225 in regular unemployment benefits, plus the $600 bonus, or $825 a week\\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 more than their regular pay. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about $21 per hour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d PolitiFact reported.\nThe average weekly total unemployment benefit as of January was $385 a week, according to different data acquired by PolitiFact from the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings Institution. That\\xc2\\xa0totals\\xc2\\xa0$24 an hour.\nFact check: COVID-19 can cause worse lung damage than smoking Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine has been nearly 20 years in the making Fact check: Not likely that COVID-19 vaccine was cause of Hank Aaron\\'s death Fact check: What\\'s true about COVID-19, its vaccine, face masks and seasonal flu?.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe methods states use to determine monetary eligibility, however, vary greatly.

But\u00a0would\u00a0the bill\u00a0\u201cregister millions of illegal aliens to vote?\u201d And is\u00a0registering millions of ineligible voters the bill\u2019s intent? Registering \u2018millions of illegal aliens\u2019 to vote.\nCruz\u00a0was\u00a0not the first\u00a0person to say\u00a0this piece of legislation\u00a0would expand\u00a0voting access to immigrants who are in the country illegally. In March, as the House deliberated\u00a0HR 1,\u00a0former Vice President Mike Pence wrote in an opinion article\u00a0that\u00a0the bill would\u00a0ensure that\u00a0\u201cmillions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote.\u201d\u00a0Similar\u00a0rhetoric then spread through viral social media posts, which claim that the bill gives immigrants in the country illegally the \u201cright to vote.\u201d.\nPolitiFact has previously rated both these claims False\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0basis that the\u00a0bill\u00a0does\u00a0nothing\u00a0to alter the legal requirement that only citizens are allowed to register to vote.\nBut Cruz continued that line of argument Tuesday. According to his spokesperson,\u00a0Cruz argues that the bill\u2019s automatic voter registration provision\u00a0\u201cwill register ineligible voters, including illegal aliens and noncitizens.\u201d.\nThe automatic voter registration provision would\u00a0expand a practice that\u00a0is\u00a0already\u00a0in place\u00a0in 19 states\u00a0(not including Texas)\u00a0and Washington,\u00a0D.C.\u00a0The policy would require state agencies to share\u00a0information collected on individuals with election officials\u00a0to help streamline voter registration processes.\u00a0A person interacting with one government office \u2014 like the department of motor vehicles or a public assistance agency \u2014 would have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes. This would automatically register eligible citizens to vote\u00a0or update their voter registration information\u00a0unless they opt out.\nThe intent of automatic voter registration is to increase voter registration rates and keep voter rolls up to date.\u00a0During the 2016 election cycle, 33% of all voter registration applications in the U.S. originated\u00a0at\u00a0a DMV, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\nThe For the People Act\u00a0states that the purpose of the automatic registration provision is to enable governments \""to register all eligible citizens to vote.\""\u00a0It also states that state agencies can share voter-registration information of eligible citizens only.\nBut Cruz\u2019s spokesperson, Steve Guest, said that although the bill \u201cpurports only to allow registration\u00a0for citizens, the bill nowhere requires proof of citizenship as part of automatic registration.\u201d.\nIt\u2019s true that the bill doesn\u2019t add a proof-of-citizenship step to the registration process.\u00a0But there\u2019s a good reason for that, said David Becker,\u00a0executive director of the\u00a0Center for Election Innovation and Research.\u00a0In 2018, a federal judge ruled that a Kansas law requiring people to prove their U.S. citizenship was\u00a0unconstitutional after the state failed to prove that a substantial number of ineligible\u00a0people managed to register to vote.\nBut the absence of that requirement doesn\\'t mean \u201cmillions of illegal aliens\u201d will begin registering, experts say.\u00a0If\u00a0a state\u00a0agency doesn\u2019t know a person\u2019s citizenship status\u00a0when referring their information to election officials, it would direct them to a registration form where they would attest to their citizenship, as required by the National Voter Registration Act.\u00a0Any voter who falsely attests to citizenship on the registration form would face\u00a0penalties for\u00a0perjury\u00a0which, in Texas, is a\u00a0class A misdemeanor\u00a0punishable by\u00a0fines and up to one year in jail.\nLocal election agencies\u00a0also\u00a0still\u00a0would\u00a0be required to determine an applicant\u2019s voting eligibility\u00a0in the same way they already do, which experts say is effective in filtering\u00a0out noncitizens.\n\u201cWe know that the deterrent effect\u00a0(of perjury penalties) and enforcement of those laws has been highly effective,\u201d Becker said. \u201cWe do not see any significant number of noncitizens on the lists.\u201d.\nSo how does Cruz figure that the bill would lead to \u201cmillions of illegal aliens\u201d registering to vote?\u00a0His office points to \u201chistorical evidence of automatic voter registration registering illegal aliens.\"".\nGuest cited\u00a0a\u00a02018\u00a0California\u00a0case\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0DMV notified\u00a0the secretary of\u00a0state that\u00a0voter registrations for\u00a023,000 Californians\u00a0had been\u00a0handled incorrectly\u00a0by the automatic voter registration system. Of that total, 1,500 noncitizens were improperly registered to vote,\u00a0according to ABC News .\u00a0Officials traced the error back to a programming flaw, then canceled the erroneous\u00a0registrations\u00a0and invalidated\u00a0mail-in ballots sent to people who were mistakenly registered.\nAutomatic voter registration glitches have occurred in other states as well. In 2017, Pennsylvania officials said they found 544 ballots\u00a0potentially\u00a0cast by noncitizens in elections dating back to 2000\u00a0\u2014\u00a0of\u00a0about\u00a093 million ballots cast.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0about 1 out of every 172,000 ballots.\n\""Those are system glitches, technical problems that absolutely should be fixed. Proving citizenship would not fix them. They were problems in how the systems were designed and they were fixed,\""\u00a0he said. Registering\u00a0millions of\u00a0noncitizens is the Democrats\u2019\u00a0intent.\nWhen asked how Democrats have demonstrated\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0intent\u00a0of the For the People Act is to \u201cregister millions of illegal aliens to vote,\u201d\u00a0Cruz\\'s spokesperson\u00a0referred to two of the 46 amendments Cruz has introduced. One would\u00a0require\u00a0people to prove their citizenship for automatic voter registration. The second would\u00a0allow\u00a0for the\u00a0prosecution of people who are automatically registered but were ineligible.\nCruz\u2019s office argues that Democrats\u2019 lack of support for these amendments proves that\u00a0their intent behind the bill is to allow noncitizens to vote.\n\u201cIf Democrats don\u2019t actually intend to register illegal aliens and the bill wouldn\u2019t actually register illegal aliens and noncitizens, then they would have supported Sen. Cruz\u2019s amendments,\u201d Guest said.\u00a0\u201cThere are millions of illegal immigrants in America. The intended effect of automatic voter registration is to register millions of illegal aliens to vote and Democrats blocked explicit provisions to verify citizenship and remove legal protections for the inevitably registered illegal aliens.\u201d.\n\""It would not be unusual for anyone who understands the law to suggest that they not include something in the bill that could violate the U.S. Constitution,\u201d he said.\nAnd the lack of support for Cruz\u2019s amendment that would allow prosecution is due to the fact that\u00a0automatic voter registration systems\u00a0do occasionally err\u00a0\u2014 as evidenced by cases in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Nevada. And it\u2019s unreasonable to\u00a0prosecute people\u00a0whose voter registrations were caught up in system glitches through no fault of their own, Becker said. Our ruling.\nDuring a Senate committee meeting over a Democratic voting rights bill, Cruz said that\u00a0the bill will\u00a0\u201cregister millions of illegal aliens to vote.\u201d\u00a0He also said that this is the Democrats\u2019 intent behind this bill because Democrats\u00a0believe these people \u201care likely to vote for Democrats.\u201d.\nHis claim is based on a requirement in the bill\u00a0that\u00a0directs states to adopt automatic voter registration systems, which 19 states and Washington D.C.\u00a0already have. But a section of the law instructs state\u00a0agencies\u00a0to\u00a0share\u00a0information for voter registration purposes only for\u00a0citizens.\u00a0People are also required to attest to their citizenship\u00a0under penalties of perjury.\nThe bill also does not change the fact that local election agencies would still be required to vet an applicant\u2019s voting eligibility, as they have done in the past.\nPolitiFact, Pence falsely says if HR 1 passes, millions of people in US illegally will be registered to vote , March 5, 2021.\nHelp Terms of Service Subscription Terms & Conditions Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Site Map Accessibility Our Ethical Principles Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie Policy."", ""evidence"": ""To Cruz, the For the People Act, or S 1, is \u201cthe most radical legislation the Senate has considered\u201d since Cruz entered office in\u00a02013, and\u00a0it\u2019s \u201cthe most dangerous legislation pending before the U.S. Congress,\u201d he said\u00a0during\u00a0a\u00a0Tuesday morning meeting of the Senate Rules Committee."", ""nli_class"": ""neutral"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9999301""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>Former Vice President Mike Pence claimed that H.R.1, known as the For the People Act of 2021, would register millions of people who are ineligible to vote.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/verify/bloody-sunday-has-hr-1-passed-the-senate-mike-pence-fact-check-biden-voting-rights-bill-illegal-immigrants-hr1-2021-summary-voting-rights/65-615cd6a7-ea72-4d65-9ccf-592e31f26d53"", ""title"": ""Bide voting rights order: HR1 undocument immigrants fact check | wcnc.com"", ""full_text"": ""Former Vice President Mike Pence claimed that H.R.1, known as the For the People Act of 2021, would register millions of people who are ineligible to vote.\nOn March 3, 2021, Former Vice President Mike Pence posted a commentary in The Daily Signal, and claimed that H.R. 1, a massive voting and ethics bill recently passed in the House of Representatives, would guarantee that millions of undocumented immigrants were registered to vote.

In an exchange about security in Iraq, Pence said, \""Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate, Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement.\"".\nThe argument centers on a period in 2011, when the Obama administration was negotiating with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to keep troops in Iraq. Called a status of forces agreement, it would have kept up to 10,000 troops on the ground beyond Dec. 31, 2011. Obama was working against a deadline signed by President George W. Bush late in 2008. Under the Bush agreement , American troops would be gone by the end of 2011.\nAs 2011 began, military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces.\nThe White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. Its number was 10,000. But the Iraqis balked as well, so that number shrank.\nAccording to the New York Times , Obama himself ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, dropping the number to about 3,500 troops.\nBut even that lower figure hit a brick wall. The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force.\n\""When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible,\"" al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. \""The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided, and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started.\"".\nAustin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor, told PolitiFact in 2015 that al-Maliki allegedly supported the residual force and may have signed a new plan, but the Iraqi Parliament would not. There has been plenty of debate since then on whether it was Washington or Baghdad that was more intractable on a new agreement.\nChristopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said an Iraqi delegation to the institute agreed terms of the planned renewal could not have passed parliament.\n\""They said that the Iraqi government was too weak and unwilling to go against the wishes of those Iraqis who wanted the Americans to leave,\"" Preble told us in 2015.\nOn Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by Christmas. Staying behind were a couple hundred Marines to train the Iraqi army and provide security for diplomatic personnel.\nImportant to this fact-check, the State Department has overall responsibility for leading the U.S. government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negotiation of status of forces agreements. However, while the U.S. ambassador to Iraq was involved (ambassadors work for the State Department), the key decisions and negotiations with Iraq took place inside the White House. At times, Obama himself was on the phone with al-Maliki.\nPence said Clinton failed to negotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq. It is accurate to say that negotiations failed. However, the claim suffers from a number of flaws.\nIt puts too much emphasis on Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role, when the key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.\nThe Obama administration wanted to insulate American troops from legal action in Iraq. That was a political minefield in Iraq. While there is room for debate on whether American negotiators could have found a way around that problem, there is no reason to believe the administration simply walked away from a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq.\nThe claim has an element of truth, but it leaves out much key information that would give a different impression.

While his first election was a nail-biter in 2012, Murphy easily won re-election in 2014.\nBefore Murphy can focus on his Republican rivals, Murphy, 33, still has to win a primary against his fellow Congressman Alan Grayson, who represents Florida\u2019s 9th district. The primary is on August 30.\nMurphy\u2019s South Florida district covers sections of St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach Counties. He is on the House Committee on Financial Services and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\nWhile most Democrats voted against a House bill to create the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2014, Murphy was one of seven Democrats who voted it.

But the Jupiter Congressman really only earned a single degree from the University of Miami \u2013 a bachelor\u2019s in business administration, with a focus on accounting and finance.\nMurphy first claimed he had two degrees during his first Congressional campaign, but his official House and re-election campaign biographies had the truth.

It is already corrected.\u201d.\nIn another strange moment from the campaign, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Vincent Gorguze of La Jolla, California donated $5,400 to Murphy. Unfortunately, Gorguze, the father-in-law of Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego, died in October 2013. Peters\u2019 campaign said Gorguze\u2019s name was listed by accident.\nThe Herald also revealed that Murphy\u2019s father, Tom Murphy, has been a major contributor to Murphy\u2019s political career. Tom Murphy has donated over $1 million to a super PAC that supports Murphy\u2019s Senate bid. This has helped Murphy raise the most money to run against Rubio. 5. President Obama & Joe Biden Support Murphy.\nIn May, the Obama Administration made a more public endorsement of Murphy when Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for him in Orlando. Biden also campaigned for Murphy in March at a Miami restaurant. Biden praised Murphy and tried not to say anything bad about Murphy\u2019s rival Grayson.\n\u201cThis is the real deal,\u201d Biden said with his hand on Murphy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe need people in the Senate who can bring people together.\u201d.\n \\t \\t\\t\\t\\tClose sidebar\\t\\t\\t Home Sports Expand sub-menu Alabama Crimson Tide Baltimore Ravens Boston Celtics Brooklyn Nets Buffalo Bills Chicago Bears Chicago Bulls Cleveland Browns Cleveland Cavaliers Dallas Cowboys Dallas Mavericks Denver Broncos Detroit Lions FC Barcelona Golden State Warriors Green Bay Packers Indianapolis Colts Kansas City Chiefs Las Vegas Raiders Los Angeles Lakers Los Angeles Rams Miami Heat Minnesota Vikings NASCAR New England Patriots New York Giants New York Jets New York Knicks Philadelphia 76ers Philadelphia Eagles Phoenix Suns Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco 49ers Seattle Seahawks Tampa Bay Buccaneers UFC Entertainment Expand sub-menu American Idol The Bachelor Bravo Dancing With the Stars Hallmark HGTV Real Housewives Teen Mom TLC The Voice Streaming News Expand sub-menu Breaking News 5 Fast Facts Crime Politics Money Shopping Expand sub-menu Deals Beauty Fitness Outdoors Toys Home Tech Garden Tools Fashion Camera Jewelry Pets Gifts Expand sub-menu Gifts for Women Gifts for Men Gifts for Seniors Gifts for Boys Gifts for Girls Gifts for Wife Gifts for Husband Gifts for Girlfriend Gifts for Boyfriend Toys for Boys Toys for Girls Christmas Gifts Hottest Christmas Toys .\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHeavy\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t About Heavy.com Contact Us Editorial Guidelines Privacy Policy Privacy Rights Terms of Service Sitemap \\t\\t.\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Facebook \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Twitter \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Subscribe \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t RSS Feed \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t."", ""evidence"": ""While most Democrats voted against a House bill to create the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2014, Murphy was one of seven Democrats who voted it."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9964236""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>In 2014, Murphy broke with most of his party when he became one of seven House Democrats to vote in favor of establishing the United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi .</b> [39] Healthcare [ edit ] ."", ""url"": ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Murphy_(Florida_politician)"", ""title"": ""Patrick Murphy (Florida politician) - Wikipedia"", ""full_text"": "" \\t\\t \\t\\t What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Cite this page Wikidata item \\t\\t \\t .\nPatrick Murphy U.S. House of Representatives Florida 18th In office January 3, 2013\u00a0\\xe2\\x80\\x93 January 3, 2017 Preceded by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen Succeeded by Brian Mast .\nPatrick Erin Murphy ( 1983-03-30 ) March 30, 1983 (age\u00a040) Miami , Florida , U.S. Democratic (2011\\xe2\\x80\\x93present) Republican (before 2011) University of Miami ( BA ).\nPatrick Erin Murphy (born March 30, 1983) is an American businessman, accountant, and politician. A Democrat , he served as the U.S. representative from Florida\\'s 18th congressional district from 2013 to 2017. He is a former Republican , having switched parties in 2011. [1] .\nMurphy was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012 , defeating Republican incumbent Allen West by 0.8% in the second-most expensive U.S. House race in history. [2] Despite the narrow Republican lean of Murphy\\'s district, he was re-elected with 59.8% of the vote in 2014. In March 2015, he announced his intentions to run in the 2016 United States Senate election in Florida ; in August 2016 he won the Democratic primary. He faced Republican incumbent Marco Rubio in the November general election, losing 52% to 44%. Early life and education [ edit ] .\nMurphy was born in Miami and raised in Key Largo , the son of Tom Murphy Jr., a construction company CEO, and his second wife, Kathleen. [3] [4] Murphy\\'s parents divorced when he was a child, and Murphy was later adopted by his father\\'s third wife, Leslie. Murphy graduated from Palmer Trinity School in Miami and then went on to take a post-graduate year at the Lawrenceville School , a private prep school in Lawrenceville, New Jersey , in 2001-2002. [5] [6] .\nAs a 19-year-old freshman college student in 2003, Murphy was arrested outside a Miami Beach nightclub on charges of disorderly intoxication and possessing a fake driver\\'s license. The charges were ultimately dropped. Murphy called the incident \""the biggest mistake of my life\"" and the \""biggest learning experience of my life.\"" [7] .\nMurphy studied business administration at the University of Miami , earning a bachelor\\'s degree with dual majors in finance and accounting in 2006. [8] [9] (In the past, Murphy\\'s official biographies said that he had dual degrees, but in fact he earned a single degree with dual majors; Murphy\\'s campaign said that the error was \""inadvertent\"" and corrected the biographies. [9] ) .\nMurphy worked for his family\\'s construction business as a construction laborer beginning at age 19, and then in the company\\'s estimating and purchasing departments and as an assistant project engineer. [6] Business career [ edit ] .\nAfter college, Murphy worked for his father\\'s business, Coastal Construction, for about a year before spending two and a half years (from September 2007 to May 2010) working as an auditor for Deloitte and Touche in Miami. [6] [8] [10] [11] .\nAfter passing the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination , he chose to become certified in Colorado, because his degree had insufficient credits to meet Florida\\'s higher education requirement. After obtaining certification in September 2009, he was promoted from \""audit assistant\"" to \""audit senior\"" at Deloitte. [8] [10] reported that Murphy had overstated his experience as an accountant, saying he had worked for \""several years\"" as an accountant when in fact he worked as a practicing CPA for less than a year, although he did much of the same accounting work as others at the firm. [12] .\nHe was hired, in May 2010, as vice president of his family\\'s construction business. [13] After the 2010 BP oil spill , he was tasked with creating a subsidiary of his father\\'s company, called Coastal Environmental, that secured contracts to remove oil in the Gulf of Mexico . [14] Murphy served as vice president of Coastal Environmental, [8] [10] and was one of its three directors from 2010 to 2012 (after being elected to Congress, Murphy stepped down as a director but remained an owner). [10] As vice president, he ran the company\\'s day-to-day operations for six months, until October 2010, when the Coast Guard called off oil skimming operations in the Gulf. [8] [10] PolitiFact.com found that \""Murphy\\'s description of his past employment is based on actual circumstances, but at times he omits a full explanation.\"" [10] .\nA 2011 gift of stock from his father boosted his personal net worth by $1\\xe2\\x80\\x935 million. [15] His father also gave $100,000 to key Democrats the same year he started to consider running for Congress. [8] U.S. House of Representatives [ edit ] Elections [ edit ] 2012 [ edit ] .\nIn 2012, Murphy moved from Fort Lauderdale to Jupiter and ran for the 18th congressional district. [16] The district had previously been the 16th District, represented by Republican Tom Rooney . It had historically been one of the more Republican districts in South Florida, having been in Republican hands for all but one term since its creation in 1973 (it had been the 10th from 1973 to 1983, the 12th from 1983 to 1993, and the 16th from 1993 to 2013). However, it had been made significantly more compact in the 2010 round of redistricting, losing most of its heavily Republican western portion to the new 17th district . Rooney opted to run in the 17th, leaving the 18th as an open seat. .\nIn the general election, Murphy faced Republican incumbent Allen West , a freshman congressman who ran for reelection in the 18th after his former district, the 22nd, had been made significantly more Democratic in redistricting. In the general election, Murphy said that he was so taken aback by some of the things West was saying in Congress and on television that he felt compelled to run against him. [13] [17] Allen had called Democrats \""Communists\"", said that Social Security was \""akin to slavery\"", and had fired a pistol near a prisoner\\'s head when serving in the Iraq War. [1] Murphy was supported by Florida\\'s former Republican Governor Charlie Crist and former Democratic President Bill Clinton , along with Republican Sheriff of Martin County Bob Crowder, who ran against West in the primaries. [18] [19] The race was among the most expensive congressional races in 2012, [20] and called one of the ugliest in the 2012 campaign, as well as one of the closest. [21] .\nMurphy was officially certified as the victor over West several days after the election, with a margin of 2,429 votes. West initially indicated that his campaign would seek to challenge the results, but he conceded defeat after Murphy\\'s victory became apparent. [22] [23] [24] 2014 [ edit ] .\nMurphy ran for re-election in 2014, and was a member of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \\'s Frontline program, designed to protect their most vulnerable incumbents. [25] Despite this, he won his bid for a second term by defeating Republican candidate Carl Domino , a former State Representative, with almost 60% of the vote, [26] even out-polling Republican Governor Rick Scott in the heavily Republican Martin County , which he carried with 55.4% of the vote. [27] He raised and spent over $5.3 million, more than any other House Democrat who ran for re-election. Of his 13 television advertisements, none of them attacked his Republican opponent. [27] Committee assignments [ edit ] Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity Political positions [ edit ] .\nMurphy was formerly a member of the Republican Party, donating the maximum individual contribution of $2,300 to Mitt Romney \\'s 2008 presidential campaign and $4,800 to other Republican candidates. Four months prior to announcing his candidacy for Congress, Murphy switched his registration to the Democratic Party and donated $4,000 to a variety of Democratic candidates. [28] He says he switched from being a Republican and a Romney supporter because of his disgust with the Tea Party movement , also citing his opponent Allen West\\'s fiery rhetoric. [29] .\nMurphy is regarded as one of the more moderate Democrats in Florida\\'s congressional delegation; he describes himself as \""fiscally responsible, socially progressive.\"" [6] He was described in The Huffington Post as a \"" pro-choice , pro- LGBT rights but \\'not ultra-liberal\\' Democrat who values fiscal responsibility.\"" [13] The top five contributors to his campaign committee for the 2013-2014 time period were his family\\'s construction company, professional services firm Deloitte , plumbing company Suntech Plumbing, multinational investment banking firm Goldman Sachs , and the PAC of the liberal foreign policy organization J Street . [30] .\nAt the time he first took office in 2013, Murphy was the youngest member of the House of Representatives, at age 29. [6] .\nMurphy has served as chair of two bipartisan organizations, the United Solutions Caucus and No Labels . [31] Economic policy [ edit ] .\nMurphy condemned the congressional Republicans who forced a government shutdown in 2013 and criticized the Tea Party Republicans who orchestrated the shutdown, writing their threat to force the U.S. into default was irresponsible. He cited the economic damage caused by the shutdown and the interruption to government operations. [31] He did not take his pay during the shutdown, donating it instead to a wounded veterans\\' organization in his home district. [32] Education [ edit ] .\nIn 2014 Murphy was one of 36 members of Congress to sign a letter urging the U.S. House Appropriations Committee to block a U.S. Department of Education proposal to tighten regulation of for-profit universities . [33] Energy and environment [ edit ] .\nIn 2013 Murphy voted in support of the Northern Route Approval Act, which would have allowed Congress to unilaterally approve construction of the Keystone Pipeline without the approval of the Obama administration . [34] .\nMurphy accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and has consistently supported action to combat climate change . [35] [36] He has called for action against toxic algal blooms in south Florida waters. [36] He opposes hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and has voted against a proposal to block federal regulations on fracking. [37] However, he believes that natural gas is a bridge fuel from fossil fuels to renewable energy , and has voted to expedite export approval for liquified natural gas , prompting criticism from some environmentalists. [37] .\nAs of August 2016, Murphy received an 80% lifetime voting rating from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), an environmental group; this score was \""lower than all but one Florida Democrat in the House but higher than all Florida Republicans.\"" [37] The LCV endorsed Murphy in the 2016 Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. [36] Foreign policy [ edit ] .\nIn 2014, Murphy broke with most of his party when he became one of seven House Democrats to vote in favor of establishing the United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi . [39] Healthcare [ edit ] .\nMurphy supports the Affordable Care Act and voted against its repeal in May 2013. [40] However, in November 2013, he signed on to a Republican-sponsored bill to waive the minimum coverage requirements of the act. [41] 2016 U.S. Senate election [ edit ] .\nMurphy ran for the U.S. Senate in 2016. Incumbent Republican Senator Marco Rubio unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, and had initially said he would vacate the seat. However, after dropping out of the presidential race, Rubio reversed himself and decided to run for re-election. [42] The Democratic primary race was contentious and occasionally negative, [43] with Murphy and fellow Democratic Congressman Alan Grayson diverging \""occasionally in policy, but drastically in personality.\"" [44] Murphy defeated Grayson in the August 30 primary. [45] .\nMurphy\\'s father, Thomas Murphy Jr., and the family\\'s construction company contributed $500,000 in early 2016 to a pro-Murphy super PAC , Floridians for a Strong Middle Class. The elder Murphy subsequently gave an additional $1 million to Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC supporting a number of Democratic Senate candidates, including Murphy. [46] [47] [48] .\nMurphy and Rubio participated in two debates in October 2016. During the debates, Rubio criticized Murphy\\'s background. Murphy responded by saying \""You continue to throw out these lies. They have all been debunked by PolitiFact.\"" PolitiFact responded that \""Murphy has exaggerated his credentials, and his opponents have also exaggerated their attacks on Murphy.\"" [49] .\nMurphy was defeated by Rubio in the general election, with Murphy receiving 44% of the vote. [50] Personal life [ edit ] .\nMurphy is a Roman Catholic [51] and is of Irish Catholic heritage.

In short, they postponed a provision of the law, but it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bailout.\nWhen the health care law started requiring insurance companies to sell policies to everyone (even sick people with pre-existing conditions), those companies were caught in a tough spot. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how much to charge in premiums to cover expenses for all those new policies.\nSo the law set up a three-year period, from 2014 to 2016, during which the government would spread the risk for insurers in the new law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marketplaces while they adjusted premiums. This program is known as risk corridors.\nIf a company is good at setting its rates and make more than a certain amount, they pay Washington some of their extra money. These are called user fees. If a company is not so good at setting rates and loses money, the government would cover some of their losses.\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the bailout to which Rubio is referring. He started calling it a \""bailout\"" for unsuccessful insurance companies in 2013, the same year he introduced an ill-fated bill in the Senate to repeal the program.\nBut let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be clear: Several experts told us risk corridors aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bailout. A bailout is usually a program that saves a company after the fact. Risk corridors are a mechanism that was put in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur.\nAnd they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t new, either. The risk corridors program was modeled after a successful plan that was part of George W. Bush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, albeit slightly different than the Obamacare version. No one referred to that as a bailout.\nFinding money for payments Now, part of the problem is that the the health care law didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say where it would get the money for any risk corridor payments. Remember those user fees from successful insurers? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, later decided they would use that money to make any payments owed to insurers that weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t so successful.\nIn 2013, CMS said insurers who said they needed money would get it, \""regardless of the balance of payments and receipts\"" in the program. Rubio took this to mean that if there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough money from user fees to cover the payments, the White House would ask Congress for money -- that is, tax revenue.\nCMS said in April 2014 it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask Congress for an appropriation, but instead would make up the difference in later years if the marketplace didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring in enough user fees. Rubio went to work, urging then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential tax money appropriations for risk corridor payments.\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Congress did. When lawmakers passed a spending bill in December 2014, it included special language called a \""rider\"" that said the CMS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not use any extra money in its budget to pay risk corridor expenses. That effectively locked CMS into its stated plan of using user fees. (The same rider was included in the 2015 spending bill.).\nSome legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language, although there have been questions about how much credit he can take. Rubio reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors.\nBy October 2015, it became apparent the risk corridors program didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work so well in the first year. CMS announced the program took in $362 million in user fees for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay.\nCMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014, then wait to see next year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results. Some insurers left the marketplaces or even collapsed altogether, leading Rubio to crow his actions have been \""a big part of ending Obamacare for good.\"" (We likely won\\'t know what the program took in for 2015 until fall 2016, and 2016\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totals until 2017.).\nWhether it will really kill Obamacare is up for debate. Some legal scholars have said all the rider did was highlight a problem the law already had and prevent a workaround. Two years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said the risk corridors will likely eventually break even by 2016.\nIf the program doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, CMS will have to find the money somehow or ask Congress to make an appropriation to pay insurers.

Rubio took this to mean that if there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough money from user fees to cover the payments, the White House would ask Congress for money -- that is, tax revenue.\nCMS said in April 2014 it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask Congress for an appropriation, but instead would make up the difference in later years if the marketplace didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring in enough user fees. Rubio went to work, urging then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential tax money appropriations for risk corridor payments .\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Congress did. When lawmakers passed a spending bill in December 2014 , it included special language called a \""rider\"" that said the CMS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not use any extra money in its budget to pay risk corridor expenses . That effectively locked CMS into its stated plan of using user fees. (The same rider was included in the 2015 spending bill .).\nSome legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language, although there have been questions about how much credit he can take. Rubio reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors.\nBy October 2015, it became apparent the risk corridors program didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work so well in the first year. CMS announced the program took in $362 million in user fees for 2014 , while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay.\nCMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014, then wait to see next year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results. Some insurers left the marketplaces or even collapsed altogether , leading Rubio to crow his actions have been \"" a big part of ending Obamacare for good .\"" (We likely won\\'t know what the program took in for 2015 until fall 2016, and 2016\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totals until 2017.).\nWhether it will really kill Obamacare is up for debate. Some legal scholars have said all the rider did was highlight a problem the law already had and prevent a workaround. Two years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said the risk corridors will likely eventually break even by 2016.\nIf the program doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, CMS will have to find the money somehow or ask Congress to make an appropriation to pay insurers. Otherwise, insurers could sue to get those payments. An Oregon insurance company that is no longer offering marketplace plans did just that on Feb. 24, suing the government for $5 billion over missed risk corridors payments.\nRubio said, \""When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.\"".\nThe \""bailout fund\"" is actually a provision in the Affordable Care Act called risk corridors, designed to temporarily aid insurers as they adjust premiums. Rubio helped persuade Congress to prevent Health and Human Services from being able to cover expenses its own budget.\nBut experts have said Rubio is wrong to call the program a bailout, and that the program is supposed to pay for itself through fees from insurers.\nFurthermore, the program hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been \""wiped out.\"" At best, Rubio and Congress have temporarily limited one potential way CMS could have covered insurance companies\\' losses. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to see what happens when the program expires after 2016 -- then any outstanding bills will be due, one way or another.\nCongressional Budget Office, \"" Updated Estimates of the Effects of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act ,\"" April 2014.\nU.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, \"" ObamaCare\u2019s Taxpayer Bailout of Health Insurers and the White House\u2019s Involvement to Increase Bailout Size ,\"" July 28, 2014.\nHealthAffairs.org, \"" Risk Corridors.

Another explanation, Tata said, is Putin is trying to divert attention from Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s struggling economy.\n\""Putin is our enemy, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no question about that, and his country is imploding,\"" Tata said on CNN Feb. 19. \""The sanctions that we put on them for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine, so they could get more natural resources down there \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well.\"".\nSpeculation abounds regarding whether Trump might roll back sanctions against Russia or soften the U.S. position on Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervention in Ukraine, so we were curious about Tata\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that the sanctions have damaged the Russian economy.\nTata has the general trend right \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy is struggling, no question \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but his numbers are slightly off. Additionally, experts said sanctions may have impacted the Russian economy, but not nearly as much as the drop in oil prices worldwide.\nTata claims 50 percent drops for both Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s currency and gross domestic product since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, a region of Ukraine. Former President Barack Obama\\'s administration first launched sanctions against Russia in response in March 2014. The European Union soon followed with its own sanctions.\nStarting with Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s currency, the ruble has lost significant value since the 2014 sanctions were put in place. In February 2014, one ruble was worth about 2.8 cents. Then the value dropped steeply over the next couple years, reaching a low point of about 1.2 cents per ruble in January 2016. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an approximately 57 percent drop.\nHowever, despite the fact that the sanctions remain in place, the ruble has steadily creeped up over the past year, reaching a value of 1.7 cents per ruble as of Feb. 21, 2017. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about 40 percent less than the value before the sanctions went into effect.\nRussia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP has also fallen over the past couple years. Tata specifically mentioned 2014-16. Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP was \\xc2\\xa0$2.053 trillion (in U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to the World Bank, dropping to $1.331 trillion in 2015 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a drop of about 35 percent.\nThe U.S. sanctions against Russia targeted specific individuals, firms and sectors close to Putin. For example, they froze U.S.-held assets that belong to some major Russian companies and banks.\nExperts had mixed opinions about the extent of the sanctions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 impact on Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy compared with other factors, notably falling oil prices.\nDeclining oil prices worldwide since 2012 are the primary reason for Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic woes given the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dependence on oil revenue and exports, said Susanne Wengle, a University of Notre Dame professor who studies Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s political economy.\nThe Russian government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s revenue is tied to oil prices, so a struggling oil industry significantly affects both the private and public sector, Wengle said. In its long-term budget projections, Russia assumed oil prices above $100 per barrel, but in 2016, prices sometimes dropped below $30.\nBeyond oil, Russia strained its budget by intervening in Crimea and depleting its reserves during the global financial crisis in 2008-09, said Sarah Wilson Sokhey, a University of Colorado, Boulder, professor who studies Russian politics and its economy.\nAlthough Sokhey doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the sanctions have had a huge impact on the economy as a whole, she said certain individuals who do international business or who import certain products, especially foods, have taken a hit. For example, Russia banned importing European cheeses as a counter-sanction, so local cheesemakers had to make their own brie instead of getting it from France.\n\""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a trivial thing,\"" Sokhey said of the sanctions. \""The Russian government would like to get rid of them, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something that is seriously hurting them or leading to widespread discontent.\"".\nMitchell Orenstein, a University of Pennsylvania professor and expert on the political economy in Eastern Europe, said he believes sanctions have significantly impacted the Russian economy by massively limiting foreign investment in Russia. The sanctions exacerbate the oil crisis by limiting Russian access to technology and capital.\n\""Sanctions are certainly a big part of the economic decline in Russia, which explains why President Putin has made it such a high priority to get rid of sanctions,\"" Orenstein said. \""It makes it much less attractive for companies to do business in or with Russia.\"".\nThe International Monetary Fund has said international sanctions and the oil price drop were \""dual shocks\"" to the Russian economy. The organization estimated that all sanctions against Russia for its activity in Ukraine, as well as Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own counter-sanctions, could reduce inflation-adjusted GDP by up to 1.5 percent.\nFor a more thorough rundown of economic analyses regarding the impact of sanctions on Russia, see this Feb. 17, 2017, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service .\nIn an email, Tata told PolitiFact that he did not mean sanctions are the only cause of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic problems. Rather, he was making a broader point that Putin is trying to shift eyes away from his country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic issues.\nTata said, \""The sanctions that we put on (Russia) for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine ... have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well.\"".\nRussia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruble fell more than 50 percent in the year following the start of sanctions in 2014, but it started to regain value in 2016. There are no GDP figures yet for Russia in 2016, but from 2014 to 2015, it fell by about 35 percent.\nIt seems a drop in oil prices are the main driver of Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems. But sanctions play at least some role \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to evaluate exactly how much given the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil crisis. \\xc2\\xa0.\nTata is right that Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy has struggled in recent years, though his numbers are a little off.\\xc2\\xa0More critically, sanctions are only part of the reason for Russia\\'s economic troubles.

The liberal show host frequently chastises the conservative Fox News, and the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s process of picking the top 10 candidates for the first Republican presidential debate gave Maddow another opportunity.\nMaddow aimed her barb at the explanation Fox News gave for deciding who would be the last candidate to make the cut-off. Fox News gave Ohio Gov. John Kasich the coveted 10th slot at the expense of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.\nMaddow accused Fox News of unilaterally sounding the death knell for the lesser-ranked candidates seven months before the first Iowa voter would show up at the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first caucus.\n\""If a candidate can\\'t even make it to the debate stage, why would rational donors and volunteers continue giving money and time to what is apparently a lost cause,\"" Maddow said on her Aug. 4, 2015, show.\nA bit later, Maddow said, \""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate.\"".\nIn particular, Maddow chastised Fox for not using an NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll that was the fifth-most recent poll on record. Fox News skipped that poll and used a slightly older poll from Quinnipiac. Maddow said this shift cost Rick Perry a shot at the nomination.\n\""He didn\\'t lose it, it was stolen from him,\"" \\xc2\\xa0she said. \""Not because of the vagaries of some poll but because of some cable news executives moving things around to effectively stack things against him.\"".\nMaddow compared what Fox News had said before and what it said after it made its picks. In this fact-check, we focus just on the question of whether Fox changed the rules of the game for the polls it would use.\nIn May, when Fox News , it laid down several selection criteria for the candidates. Among them was this: \""Must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News leading up to August 4th at 5 PM/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques.\"".\nFox News directed us to a that added just one detail from Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news for Fox. Clemente said online and partisan polls were unacceptable.\nBut on who would make it to the main stage (a forum for the runners-up takes place earlier at 5 p.m.), it gave a far more detailed explanation of its selection rules than what it laid out in May:.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""They are the five most recent national polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques. Recency was determined by actual interview dates (not release date).\"" \\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""They used live interviewers, random digit-dial sampling techniques and included both landlines and cellphones. (No online or automated (IVR) polls were used.)\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""Results among registered voters were used rather than national adult results when available. Furthermore, only results among either 1) self-identified Republican primary voters or 2) Republican and Republican-leaning voters were used.\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""The rank order was determined by a simple arithmetic average of publicly available results. Averages were rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""Each poll has a different margin of error, and averaging requires a distinct test of statistical significance. Given the over 2,400 interviews contained within the five polls, from a purely statistical perspective it is at least 90% likely that the tenth place Kasich is ahead the eleventh place Perry.\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""We did not include the highly-respected NBC/WSJ poll, which is the fifth most recent poll, only because it did not meet our criterion that the poll read the names of each Republican candidate in the vote question. We would note, however, even though their ballot question included Perry but did not name Kasich, the unaided \""Kasich\"" response tied the aided \""Perry\"" response. In short, their results are consistent with the results of the other polls in our review, and consistent with the resulting placement in the Fox News debate.\"".\nIn May, Fox News took 45 words to describe how it would use polls to pick the candidates. In August, it used more than 260. Without a doubt, Fox moved from a broad to a detailed approach. We turned to political scientists to help us assess whether that shift is the same as Maddow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that \""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria.\"".\nThe bottom line from the analysts we reached is that the original poll criteria were destined to be insufficient to meet the goal of giving Fox News a clear ranking of the top 10. During her show, Maddow interviewed Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. We asked Sabato to assess her statement.\n\""We were never sure which polls could be included and which could not, beyond the requirements about live calls/interviewers and the like,\"" Sabato told PunditFact. \""You can call it \\xe2\\x80\\x98changing the rules\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if you want, but you could also say they reserved to themselves some flexibility, not knowing precisely what the polling community would serve up.\"".\n\""They added criteria after they saw what the polls were,\"" Redlawsk said. \""To me this is different. Fox should have been more specific from the beginning.\"".\nBy comparison, in May, it would use for the debates it plans for September and provided a much more detailed description of how it would use those polling results.\nThat said, Fox News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision to use polls based on when they called voters and how they posed their questions passed muster with Robert Erikson at Columbia University.\n\""If Kasich was not on the NBC/WSJ ballot, the Fox decision makes sense,\"" Erikson said. \""Release data is less important than date in the field. It was my impression that even with NBC/WSJ included, Perry would lose out, only by an even more trivial amount.\"".\nMichael Traugott, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, has taken a careful look at how news organizations use polls. \\xc2\\xa0 He wrote a critique of CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""poll of polls\"" after the 2008 election.\n\""The most important point is that the system is arbitrary, used to satisfy production values for television rather than being based on any substantive or political consideration,\"" he told us. \""The network is trying to use a statistical justification to cover a news judgment decision.\"".\nTraugott said that taking the average of candidate standing in polls is a bad idea on a number of grounds. Mainly, differences in how polling organizations chose their respondents and phrase their questions have a much greater impact than the statistical margin of error.\nWe contacted both MSNBC and Fox News. MSNBC said Maddow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement was correct based on Fox News adding the criteria that the GOP primary vote question mirror \""the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics.\"" Fox News declared that this made no difference.\nMaddow said that \""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate.\"" We found that the poll criteria were much more detailed in August (over 260 words long) than they were in May (about 45 words long).\nThe network could have been more precise early on, but Fox did leave\\xc2\\xa0some room for itself when it qualified the\\xc2\\xa0polls it planned to use for the debate back in May with\\xc2\\xa0\""as recognized by Fox News.\"".\nAlso, some experts said, Maddow exaggerated the impact of the approach Fox News ultimately used, and she implied that statistical certainty was achievable under any circumstances.\\xc2\\xa0.\nFox News moved from a broad approach to a more detailed one, and experts aren\\'t convinced that it slighted Perry.

Maddow said this shift cost Rick Perry a shot at the nomination.\n\""He didn\\'t lose it, it was stolen from him,\"" \\xc2\\xa0she said. \""Not because of the vagaries of some poll but because of some cable news executives moving things around to effectively stack things against him.\"".\nMaddow compared what Fox News had said before and what it said after it made its picks. In this fact-check, we focus just on the question of whether Fox changed the rules of the game for the polls it would use.\nIn May, when Fox News , it laid down several selection criteria for the candidates. Among them was this: \""Must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News leading up to August 4th at 5 PM/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques.\"".\nFox News directed us to a that added just one detail from Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news for Fox. Clemente said online and partisan polls were unacceptable.\nBut on who would make it to the main stage (a forum for the runners-up takes place earlier at 5 p.m.), it gave a far more detailed explanation of its selection rules than what it laid out in May:.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""They are the five most recent national polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques. Recency was determined by actual interview dates (not release date).\"" \\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""They used live interviewers, random digit-dial sampling techniques and included both landlines and cellphones. (No online or automated (IVR) polls were used.)\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""Results among registered voters were used rather than national adult results when available. Furthermore, only results among either 1) self-identified Republican primary voters or 2) Republican and Republican-leaning voters were used.\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""The rank order was determined by a simple arithmetic average of publicly available results. Averages were rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""Each poll has a different margin of error, and averaging requires a distinct test of statistical significance. Given the over 2,400 interviews contained within the five polls, from a purely statistical perspective it is at least 90% likely that the tenth place Kasich is ahead the eleventh place Perry.\"".\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \""We did not include the highly-respected NBC/WSJ poll, which is the fifth most recent poll, only because it did not meet our criterion that the poll read the names of each Republican candidate in the vote question. We would note, however, even though their ballot question included Perry but did not name Kasich, the unaided \""Kasich\"" response tied the aided \""Perry\"" response. In short, their results are consistent with the results of the other polls in our review, and consistent with the resulting placement in the Fox News debate.\"".\nIn May, Fox News took 45 words to describe how it would use polls to pick the candidates. In August, it used more than 260. Without a doubt, Fox moved from a broad to a detailed approach. We turned to political scientists to help us assess whether that shift is the same as Maddow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that \""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria.\"".\nThe bottom line from the analysts we reached is that the original poll criteria were destined to be insufficient to meet the goal of giving Fox News a clear ranking of the top 10. During her show, Maddow interviewed Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. We asked Sabato to assess her statement.\n\""We were never sure which polls could be included and which could not, beyond the requirements about live calls/interviewers and the like,\"" Sabato told PunditFact. \""You can call it \\xe2\\x80\\x98changing the rules\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if you want, but you could also say they reserved to themselves some flexibility, not knowing precisely what the polling community would serve up.\"".\n\""They added criteria after they saw what the polls were,\"" Redlawsk said. \""To me this is different. Fox should have been more specific from the beginning.\"".\nBy comparison, in May, it would use for the debates it plans for September and provided a much more detailed description of how it would use those polling results.\nThat said, Fox News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision to use polls based on when they called voters and how they posed their questions passed muster with Robert Erikson at Columbia University.\n\""If Kasich was not on the NBC/WSJ ballot, the Fox decision makes sense,\"" Erikson said. \""Release data is less important than date in the field. It was my impression that even with NBC/WSJ included, Perry would lose out, only by an even more trivial amount.\"".\nMichael Traugott, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, has taken a careful look at how news organizations use polls. \\xc2\\xa0 He wrote a critique of CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""poll of polls\"" after the 2008 election.\n\""The most important point is that the system is arbitrary, used to satisfy production values for television rather than being based on any substantive or political consideration,\"" he told us. \""The network is trying to use a statistical justification to cover a news judgment decision.\"".\nTraugott said that taking the average of candidate standing in polls is a bad idea on a number of grounds. Mainly, differences in how polling organizations chose their respondents and phrase their questions have a much greater impact than the statistical margin of error.\nWe contacted both MSNBC and Fox News. MSNBC said Maddow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement was correct based on Fox News adding the criteria that the GOP primary vote question mirror \""the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics.\"" Fox News declared that this made no difference.\nMaddow said that \""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate.\"" We found that the poll criteria were much more detailed in August (over 260 words long) than they were in May (about 45 words long).\nThe network could have been more precise early on, but Fox did leave\\xc2\\xa0some room for itself when it qualified the\\xc2\\xa0polls it planned to use for the debate back in May with\\xc2\\xa0\""as recognized by Fox News.\"".\nAlso, some experts said, Maddow exaggerated the impact of the approach Fox News ultimately used, and she implied that statistical certainty was achievable under any circumstances.\\xc2\\xa0.\nFox News moved from a broad approach to a more detailed one, and experts aren\\'t convinced that it slighted Perry.

on Wednesday, March 14, against Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chief, just minutes after he was sentenced to an additional 43 months in prison in another case. .\nManafort, 69, who appeared in court in a wheelchair, is now facing a total of 7.5 years in jail after going before two federal judges for tax crimes, bank fraud and conspiracy charges. .\nTrump has previously dangled the possibility of a pardon for Manafort, who headed his White House bid for two months in 2016, but the president said on Wednesday that he has \u201cnot even given it a thought.\u201d .\nTrump could pardon Manafort for the array of federal crimes he has been convicted of, but he would be unable to do anything about a potential conviction in New York state, where the latest charges were brought. .\n\u201cNo one is beyond the law in New York,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in announcing the 16-count indictment of Manafort. .\nManafort\u2019s prosecution is one of the most high-profile cases stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. .\nTrump seized upon Manafort\u2019s sentencing by Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington to claim it had been \u201cproven again today\u201d that \u201cthere was no collusion\u201d between anyone on his election campaign and Moscow. .\nBut Jackson, in sentencing Manafort for conspiracy charges, did not say the case had proven there was no collusion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she merely said the question of collusion was \u201cnot presented in this case.\u201d .\nManafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison by another judge last week for 5 counts of filing false income tax returns, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failing to report a foreign bank account. .\nThe charges were related to more than $55 million he earned doing lobbying and consulting for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine and his use of offshore bank accounts to hide the payments from US tax authorities. .\nThe Ukrainian money was used to support a lifestyle which included purchases of luxury homes and cars, antique rugs, and expensive clothes, including an $18,500 python jacket. .\nManafort appeared before Jackson for sentencing on two counts of conspiracy he pleaded guilty to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one involving money laundering and failure to register as a foreign agent and the other involving witness tampering. .\nJackson could have sentenced Manafort to 5 years in prison on each count, but she opted to tack on a total of 43 months to his previous sentence and give him 9 months off as credit for time served. .\nKevin Downing, an attorney for Manafort, had told the judge earlier that \u201cbut for a short stint as a campaign manager in a presidential election, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be here today.\u201d .\nManafort, who was in a wheelchair because of gout, pleaded to the judge not to sentence him to more time in prison. .\n\u201cI am sorry for what I have done and all the activities that have got me here today,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cLet me be very clear I accept responsibility. .\nManafort, who worked on the White House bids of Republicans Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole, asked the judge to let him be with his wife. \u201cShe needs me and I need her,\u201d he said. .\nMichael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, is to begin serving a three-year prison sentence on May 6 for fraud, tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and lying to Congress. .\nFormer national security advisor Michael Flynn admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials and is also awaiting sentencing. .\nGeorge Papadopoulos , a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and spent 12 days in prison. .\n \\t \\t\\t Facebook \\t \\t \\t\\t Twitter \\t \\t \\t\\t YouTube \\t \\t \\t\\t Instagram \\t \\t \\t\\t LinkedIn \\t \\t \\t\\t Viber \\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t.\n \\t Join Rappler+ \\t Know more here \\t\\t\\t Crowdfunding Founding board Rappler board of directors About Us Mission Statement Editorial standards and guidelines The Team Contact Us Privacy Statement Terms of Use Comment Moderation Policy \\t\\t \\t."", ""evidence"": ""\u201cNo one is beyond the law in New York,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in announcing the 16-count indictment of Manafort."", ""nli_class"": ""entailment"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9950853""}, {""snippet"": ""<b>Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort on Wednesday faces\u00a0his second federal sentencing this month, as Special Counsel Robert Mueller pushes for him to receive 10 additional years in prison on top of the 47-month term issued less than a week ago by Virginia Judge T.S.</b>"", ""url"": ""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/manafort-faces-up-to-10-years-in-sentencing-befre-judge-amy-berman-jackson"", ""title"": ""Manafort faces up to 10 years in sentencing before Judge Amy Berman Jackson | Fox News"", ""full_text"": ""U.S. Crime Military Education Terror Immigration Economy Personal Freedoms Fox News Investigates World U.N.

Judge Amy Berman Jackson allow Manafort to serve whatever sentence she gives him concurrently with that 47-month term -- a move that Mueller\\'s prosecutors haven\\'t outwardly resisted, and that Manafort\\'s team argues is the most legally sound approach?.\nAnd second: Will President Trump, who has long characterized Mueller\\'s Russia probe as a partisan \""witch hunt\"" that unfairly has ensnared his onetime campaign manager, eventually issue a pardon or commutation regardless of what Jackson does? (\""Why would I take [a pardon] off the table?\"" Trump asked last year.).\nMueller, in court\u00a0documents, has stopped short of recommending a specific sentence in the D.C. case, but has argued\u00a0that Jackson has no reason not to throw the book at the 69-year-old\u00a0Manafort. The former lobbyist and political consultant avoided a trial before Jackson late last year by agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors and pleading\u00a0guilty to two felony conspiracy charges related to his overseas lobbying work.\nJackson ruled in February that Manafort \""intentionally\"" breached that plea agreement by lying to investigators, and Mueller\\'s team has presented Manafort as a hardened criminal who \""repeatedly and brazenly violated the law ... for over a decade.\"".\nPerhaps most significantly, Mueller\\'s team alleged that Manafort had lied about an August 2016 meeting with Konstantin Kilimnik, a business associate who the U.S. said had ties to Russian intelligence. Mueller\\'s prosecutors have said that cut\u00a0to the \""heart\"" of the Russia probe, but Manafort\\'s lawyers have maintained that any misstatements by Manafort were immaterial or unintentional, and that there was no evidence Manafort had any illegal contacts with Kilimnik.\nThe meeting involved a discussion of a potential peace plan between Russia and Ukraine, but many other details about it have been redacted in court papers.\nFederal sentencing guidelines\u00a0called for Manafort to receive nearly two decades in prison, although the two charges to which Manafort pleaded carry a maximum term of 5 years imprisonment each. In the Virginia case, in which Manafort was convicted by a jury on eight bank-and-tax-fraud charges,\u00a0Ellis said the guidelines of sentencing Manafort to between 19 and 24 years in prison were \""excessive.\"".\nUnlike Ellis --\u00a0the Reagan-appointed Virginia-based judge who repeatedly\u00a0taunted and tormented Mueller\\'s team last year , and declared openly that Manafort was being prosecuted only to get to President Trump -- Jackson is widely seen as relatively sympathetic to the government\\'s case against Manafort.\nJudge Jackson has taken a tough approach in ongoing prosecution of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, which is also being run by Mueller. And, in 2013, the judge sentenced former Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr., a Democrat, to 30 months in prison -- less than the 46 to 57 months requested by the government, but also significantly more than the 18 months defense attorneys had requested.\n\""The inescapable fact is that you and Sandra Jackson used campaign funds to sustain a lifestyle that you cannot afford,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Judge Jackson said at the time, referring to the congressman\\'s wife. At the same time, the judge\u00a0did cut the two something of a break\u00a0by granting them the ability to serve their sentences at separate times\u00a0to accommodate their two children.\nJudge Jackson has a major opportunity to show similar leniency to Manafort: She has the authority to allow Manafort to serve his sentence in the D.C. case concurrently with the 47-month sentence from the Virginia case. And, Manafort\\'s lawyers have argued there\\'s a strong legal basis for Judge Jackson to do so, noting that federal sentencing guidelines ordinarily advise judges to exercise their discretion and\u00a0consider allowing sentences to run concurrently where two separate criminal cases involve conduct \""relevant\"" to one another.\nIn sentencing documents, Mueller did not take a position on whether Judge Jackson should afford Manafort that luxury, explaining that it was \""unknown\"" what the sentence would be. Still, Mueller\u00a0reserved the right to take a position later in court on Wednesday.\n\""It is fair to say that, but for the appointment of the Special Counsel and his Office\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to pursue Mr. Manafort for a rarely prosecuted FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] violation, Mr. Manafort would not have been indicted in the District of Columbia,\"" the attorneys wrote to\u00a0Jackson.\nThe defense team\\'s filing also included numerous letters from friends and associates of Manafort arguing on his behalf. In one letter, a family friend wrote that Manafort frequently would cut short business trips\u00a0and even take overnight flights, solely to see his children\\'s basketball games and attend to other family responsibilities.\nFurther, Manafort\\'s team argued, the relatively light sentences handed out in other cases prosecuted by Mueller should guide Jackson -- and provided evidence that Mueller has come up empty in his search for improper Russia collusion by the Trump team.\n\""The sentences already imposed in other cases that have been investigated and/or prosecuted by the Special Counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office reflect the fact that courts recognize that these prosecutions bear little to no relation to the Special Counsel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core mandate of investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election,\"" the attorneys wrote.\nThey specifically cited the two-week sentence given to former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI, as well as the 36-month sentence given to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, five counts of tax evasion, one count of falsifying submissions to a bank\u00a0and two campaign finance violations.\u00a0Cohen was ordered to pay $1.4 million in restitution and a $50,000 fine, and to forfeit $500,000.\n\""The Special Counsel\\'s attempt to portray [Manafort]\u00a0as a lifelong and irredeemable felon is beyond the pale and grossly overstates the facts before this Court,\"" the attorneys wrote, adding that the case has\u00a0\""devastated him personally, professionally, and financially.\"".\nU.S. Crime Military Education Terror Immigration Economy Personal Freedoms Fox News Investigates World U.N.

Early life and education [ edit ] .\nAmy Berman was born on July 22, 1954, in Baltimore , Maryland , [3] She is the daughter of Mildred (Sauber) and Barnett Berman, a physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital . [4] She received her A.B. from Harvard College in 1976 and her Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1979. [5] Legal career [ edit ] .\nAfter graduating from law school, Jackson served as a law clerk to Judge Harrison Lee Winter of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit from 1979 to 1980. From 1980 to 1986, she served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia , where she received Department of Justice Special Achievement Awards for her work on high-profile murder and sexual assault cases in 1985 and 1986. From 1986 to 1994, Jackson was an associate and then a partner at Venable, Baetjer, Howard and Civiletti . [6] .\nFrom 2000 until her appointment as a federal judge, Jackson was a member of the law firm Trout Cacheris & Solomon PLLC in Washington, D.C. where she specialized in complex litigation, criminal investigations and defense, criminal trials, civil trials, and appeals. In 2009 Jackson represented nine-term Representative for Louisiana\\'s 2nd congressional district William J. Jefferson in his corruption trial . .\nJackson has served as a legal commentator for Fox News , CNN , NBC , and MSNBC . [7] [5] Federal judicial service [ edit ] Nomination and confirmation [ edit ] .\nOn June 17, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Jackson to fill a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that was vacated by Judge Gladys Kessler , who assumed senior status in 2007. [6] She was unanimously rated \""well qualified\"" for the post by the American Bar Association \\'s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary (the committee\\'s highest rating). [8] Her nomination lapsed at the end of the 111th Congress ; [9] Obama renominated her on January 5, 2011, at the beginning of the 112th Congress . [10] The United States Senate confirmed Jackson on March 17, 2011, by a 97\\xe2\\x80\\x930 vote. [11] She received her commission the next day. [5] Selected opinions [ edit ] Labor law [ edit ] .\nIn (2012), Jackson ruled that the National Labor Relations Board had the statutory authority to promulgate a federal regulation requiring the posting of workplace posters informing workers of the right to organize and collectively bargain , but also struck down the portions of the regulation in which the NLRB made a \""blanket advance determination that a failure to post [the notice] will always constitute an unfair labor practice\"" and tolled the statute of limitations in unfair labor practice actions involving a failures to post. [12] [13] [14] The next year, the D.C. Circuit vacated the NLRB rule, finding that it contravened Section 8(c) of the National Labor Relations Act , the provision protecting most employers\\' speech. [14] .\nIn 2015, Jackson ruled against a coalition of businesses who challenged an NLRB rule expediting union elections. [15] [16] EPA & Spruce Mine permit [ edit ] .\nAlso in March 2012, Jackson overturned a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that revoked a permit for the Spruce 1 mine project in Logan County, West Virginia , on the ground that the EPA did not have power under the Clean Water Act to rescind the permit. [17] That ruling was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in April 2013. [18] On September 30, 2014, Jackson ruled in the EPA\\'s favor, allowing its veto of the permit to stand. [19] Jesse Jackson Jr. [ edit ] .\nJackson presided at the August 2013 sentencing of former U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife, Sandi Jackson . After accepting guilty pleas to misuse of campaign funds, she sentenced Representative Jackson to 30 months and his wife to 12 months in prison. [20] [ edit ] .\nIn December 2013, in the case of , Jackson ruled for the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Washington in its constitutional test case challenge to the contraceptive mandate under the Affordable Care Act as applied to the church\\'s District of Columbia employees. [21] The United States Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies made accommodations for religious organizations, under which such organizations did not have to \""provide, pay for, or facilitate access to contraception\"" if they certify their objection to doing so. [21] [22] Jackson rejected the archdiocese\\'s argument that the act of \""self-certifying\"" in itself constitutes a substantial burden on the archdiocese\\'s right to freely exercise religion. [22] Benghazi wrongful death case [ edit ] .\nIn May 2017, Jackson dismissed a wrongful death suit filed against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by the parents of two of the Americans killed in the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya, on the basis of the Westfall Act . [23] Paul Manafort and Rick Gates [ edit ] .\nIn October 2017, Jackson was assigned to preside over the criminal case that Special Counsel Robert Mueller brought against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election cycle . She accepted their \""not guilty\"" pleas, granted bail, confiscated their passports, and ordered them held under house arrest. She also warned defense lawyers not to discuss the case outside of court. [24] On June 15, 2018, after the prosecution accused Manafort of attempted witness tampering , Jackson revoked his bail and sent him to jail until his upcoming federal trials. [25] On February 23, 2018, Gates pleaded guilty to one count of false statements and one count of conspiracy against the United States . [26] The plea bargain to which Gates agreed included his cooperation with the Mueller investigation. [27] On September 14, 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy against the United States and his plea bargain similarly included an agreement to cooperate with Mueller\\'s investigation. [28] But on February 13, 2019, Jackson ruled that Manafort had lied to Mueller\\'s office, to the FBI, and to a grand jury after having pleaded guilty regarding his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik , a man the FBI believed had ties to Russian intelligence agencies. Jackson ruled that the Special Counsel was no longer bound by the original terms of Manafort\\'s plea, which included the prosecution having committed to advocating a sentence reduction for him. [29] Trump pardoned Manafort on December 23, 2020, the same day he pardoned Roger Stone. [30] Alex van der Zwaan [ edit ] .\nOn April 3, 2018, Jackson sentenced a former associate of Gates, Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan , who practiced in London, to one month in prison and a $20,000 fine. [31] Van der Zwaan had pleaded guilty to a single count of making a false statement to investigators regarding alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections . [32] Upon release he was deported to Holland. [33] In December 2020, Trump pardoned him. [34] Roger Stone [ edit ] .\nIn January 2019 Jackson was assigned the case of Roger Stone , who had been an informal advisor to 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump , after a grand jury had indicted Stone on seven counts including making false statements, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering. [35] On February 15, 2019, Jackson imposed a limited gag order on Stone and his attorneys. [36] On February 18, Stone posted an Instagram photo of Jackson. [37] Stone took his post down and apologized, but on February 21, Jackson tightened the terms of his gag order, saying, \""From this moment on, the defendant may not speak publicly about this case\\xe2\\x80\\x94period.\"" [38] [39] In February 2020, the Department of Justice prosecutors recommended a seven-to-nine-year federal prison sentence for Stone. Trump characterized the recommendation as unfair and \""a miscarriage of justice\"". But the Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr recommended a shorter sentence, indicating that it should be \""far less.\"" Irate, the four lead prosecutors resigned from the case. [40] Trump criticized Jackson\\'s earlier judicial rulings on Twitter. [41] On February 20, 2020, Jackson said before Stone\\'s sentencing: \""He was not prosecuted, as some have claimed, for standing up for the president. He was prosecuted for covering up for the president.\"" Jackson denied that Stone was being punished for his politics or his allies. [42] She sentenced him to 40 months in federal prison and a $20,000 fine. [43] Stone\\'s lawyers moved to disqualify Jackson; Jackson denied the motion on the basis of lack of \""factual or legal support\"" for it. [44] Jackson criticized Trump\\'s personal attacks on the Stone jury foreperson after the verdict. [45] Trump tweeted, \""There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of \\'Trump\\' and Stone. She was totally biased, as is the judge. Roger wasn\\'t even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!\"" [45] .\nTrump commuted Stone\\'s sentence in July 2020, shortly before Stone was scheduled to report to federal prison. He pardoned Stone on December 23, 2020, four weeks before Joe Biden was sworn in. [30] Mueller investigation memo [ edit ] .\nIn May 2021, Jackson found that the Justice Department under Barr had inappropriately failed to release a memo by the Special Counsel about alleged obstruction of justice. Her opinion described Barr as having summarized \""what he\\'d hardly had time to skim, much less study closely, [which] prompted an immediate reaction, as politicians and pundits took to their microphones and Twitter feeds to decry what they feared was an attempt to hide the ball.\"" [46] Former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance believed that Berman could refer Barr for investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility or to the Justice department\\'s Inspector General , with possibilities of censure, disbarment or prosecution. Either the IG or the OPR could further refer the case to the DOJ\\'s Public Integrity Section , which could initiate an investigation and/or prosecution. [47] Affiliations [ edit ] .\nJackson served on the board of the Washington D.C. Rape Crisis Center and has also been a member of the Parent Steering Committee of the Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental and Learning Disorders. [7] Personal life [ edit ] .\nJackson was married to Darryl W. Jackson, a lawyer and a senior Republican political appointee. [48] He worked in Office of Export Enforcement as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for George W. Bush in 2005 after leaving the Arnold & Porter firm. [49] They have two sons, one of whom is Matt Jackson , who won 13 consecutive games on Jeopardy! , earning $411,612. [50] [51] While appearing on the trivia show, he said, \""My mom is white, liberal and Jewish, and my dad is black, Christian and conservative.\"" [2] [48] .\nIn her spare time, Jackson writes music and sings.

Charges will also be elevated to a Class D Felony for anyone who assaults and seriously injures a public or civil servant and/or brandishes a dangerous weapon in the process.

Christina Bohannan (D-Iowa City) during a House debate Wednesday night. .\nOthers, such as Republican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann, applauded the move and noted the importance of enabling police to do their jobs properly under pressure: .\nRepublicans have been clear \u2013 we stand with Iowa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s men and women in law enforcement.

Trump has said that the investigations scrutinizing his actions have been driven by his political opponents. Credit... Christopher Lee for The New York Times.\nAs he awaits possible indictment by the Manhattan district attorney and remains under scrutiny in multiple other criminal investigations, former President Donald J. Trump has regularly railed against a justice system that he contends has been deployed against him by his political opponents.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Biden regime\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weaponization of our system of justice is straight out of the Stalinist Russia horror show,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told a rally in Texas on Saturday night.\nBut as is often the case with Mr. Trump, his accusations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 widely repeated by other Republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 reflect his own pattern of conduct: his history of threatening or seeking to employ the expansive powers of the presidency to go after his enemies, real and perceived.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was always telling me that we need to use the F.B.I. and I.R.S. to go after people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was constant and obsessive and is just what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claiming is being done to him now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second White House chief of staff.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would tell him why it was wrong, and while I was there I did everything I could to steer him away from it and tell him why it was a bad idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kelly said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought we were successful, but he would often ask a lot of people to do a lot of things that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do himself in the hopes that someone would do it and he could claim he did nothing wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nSome of his demands were public, and to some degree a political performance, like his calls, never acted upon, for the prosecution of Hillary Clinton, his defeated rival in the 2016 campaign.\nOther actions were personal, and more petty. He blocked then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi from using a military plane in 2019 to visit troops in Afghanistan. Andrew McCabe was temporarily denied his federal pension upon retiring as deputy director of the F.B.I., after intense criticism from Mr. Trump for his role in the Russia investigation.\nThe Possible Indictment of Donald Trump Specter of Violence Looms: \\xc2\\xa0In a social media post, Donald Trump warned of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotential death and destruction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d if he was indicted . Hours later, the Manhattan district attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office received a threatening letter. Suppressing October Surprises: \\xc2\\xa0The payoff to Stormy Daniels that has a Manhattan grand jury weighing criminal charges against Trump can trace its lineage to political skulduggery in 1968 and 1980 . Perp-Walk Fixation : \\xc2\\xa0As Trump focuses on how an indictment would look , he has appeared significantly disconnected from the severity of his potential legal woes. From Ally to Antagonist : \\xc2\\xa0Michael Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Trump. Now, Cohen is hoping to help prosecutors put him away .\nIn some instances, Mr. Trump acted more quietly and persistently. Among those he wanted to see prosecuted was John F. Kerry, the former senator, Democratic presidential nominee and secretary of state under President Barack Obama.\nMr. Trump maintained that Mr. Kerry had broken the law by staying in touch with Iranian officials with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal that Mr. Trump was unwinding. As president, Mr. Trump repeatedly pressed senior officials behind closed doors about using the Justice Department to target Mr. Kerry, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nUltimately, federal prosecutors in New York were pushed by senior Justice Department officials in Washington to investigate Mr. Kerry, according to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan at the time.\nJohn R. Bolton, who served as Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security adviser, said the former president is now clearly playing to a base that has increasingly embraced his claims of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweaponization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about a range of investigations, and responded to his portrayal of himself as its victim. But, Mr. Bolton said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe idea that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a paragon of virtue who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do this to other people and is now a victim of this unfairness really is laughable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAsked to comment about Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of the levers of power to go after his enemies, including Mr. Kerry, a senior consultant to Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, Chris LaCivita, spoke only of Mr. Kerry and reiterated the call for his prosecution, calling him \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca threat to national security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nFor decades, Mr. Trump has generally viewed institutions and systems as entities that reward friends and allies of those leading them and that punish their enemies. It was how he perceived the world of machine politics that surrounded him in New York City as he was growing up. He has long made clear that he believes every system and every person is corruptible.\nJohn F. Kelly, Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second White House chief of staff, said that the former president would regularly suggest using the F.B.I. and I.R.S. against his political opponents. Credit...

I know that, and you know that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the former C.I.A. director, John Brennan, recalled Mr. Trump saying at their first meeting, in reference to his distrust of human intelligence sources.\nMr. Trump has insisted that he would not be facing the possibility of an indictment in Manhattan on charges related to hush-money payments to a porn star if times were different. He has described Robert M. Morgenthau, who died in 2019 and was a predecessor of the current Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriend of mine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who would not have tolerated a prosecution.\nWhile Mr. Trump did little to hide his desire to use his power against his foes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he often blasted it out on his Twitter account or discussed it publicly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is unclear how much impact his demands had in the face of the reluctance to act on them on the part of aides, prosecutors and others.\nHow Times reporters cover politics. \\xc2\\xa0 We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.\nMr. Trump privately pushed aides like Mr. Kelly to revoke the security clearances of former top intelligence officials who were critical of him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes someone wrote an op-ed criticizing you, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you should go and do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kelly recounted telling Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to order the Justice Department to prosecute Mrs. Clinton and James B. Comey, whom he had fired as F.B.I. director, was rebuffed by his White House counsel at the time, Donald F. McGahn II.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsensus has emerged that a key component of ensuring fair criminal proceedings is avoiding even the appearance of political motivation for prosecution or criminal investigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. McGahn wrote. That notion, he added, had solidified in the years after the Watergate scandal, when it was revealed how Richard M. Nixon had tried to target his rivals.\nBut legal experts say the mere knowledge that Mr. Trump tried to use them for his own purposes damages public confidence that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. will follow the law, and the facts, rather than go in a political direction.\nIn the case of Mr. Kerry, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time, Geoffrey Berman, has said there was a direct link between Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desires and the pressure put on his office to prosecute Mr. Kerry. In a book published in September, Mr. Berman said that two days after Mr. Trump said on Twitter that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe United States does not need John Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in May 2018, Justice Department officials in Washington referred a case to Mr. Berman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office to determine whether Mr. Kerry had broken the law by being in contact with Iranian officials after he left office.\nMr. Berman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office investigated Mr. Kerry in the months that followed. A little less than a year later, Mr. Trump again spoke out on Twitter about Mr. Kerry, repeating the allegation that he had broken the law by remaining in contact with the Iranians.\nThat afternoon, Mr. Berman said, his office received a call from David Burns, a top national security prosecutor at the Justice Department in Washington, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho wanted to know why we were delaying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the inquiry, and why his office had not taken a step that would have given investigators access to parts of Mr. Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s electronic communications.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were asking us, basically, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking so long?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Berman wrote in his book. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you going harder and faster at this enemy of the president? There was no other way for me to look at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nA spokesman for Mr. Burns\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law firm, Gibson Dunn, where Mr. Burns is now the co-chairman of its national security practice, declined to comment.\nMr. Berman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office ultimately decided against prosecuting Mr. Kerry. Shortly after the office told senior Justice Department officials in Washington of that decision, the chief of staff for Attorney General William P. Barr told Mr. Berman that national security prosecutors in Washington were likely to take Mr. Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case to another U.S. attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office.\nIn April 2020, Mr. Berman said that the U.S. attorney in Maryland, Robert K. Hur, called him to discuss the case, which had been reassigned to Mr. Hur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Like Mr. Berman, Mr. Hur declined to prosecute Mr. Kerry. In January 2023, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland appointed Mr. Hur as a special counsel, to investigate whether President Biden and his aides had mishandled classified documents found at Mr. Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home and in an office he used in Washington."", ""evidence"": ""Former President Donald J.

Is that correct? .\nThe controversy over a letter to Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaders signed by 47 Republican senators prompted a sudden surge of interest in past efforts by lawmakers to meet with foreign leaders.\nAfter taking hits from many Democrats and some Republicans who said the letter unwisely undercut President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear capabilities, Republicans pushed back with examples of congressional Democrats engaged in overseas freelancing when Republicans held the White House.\nFor instance, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh charged that the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy \""sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact.\"" We rated that claim . Other claims have House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other lawmakers.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared on CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s State of the Union on March 15 to answer questions from host Dana Bash about what she called the \""rushed way\"" the letter was circulated as senators were trying to get out of town for a snowstorm. She asked McConnell to explain the process, but McConnell began by sidestepping her question.\n\""Well, Dana, first, let me just say, I think this is a good case of selective outrage,\"" McConnell said. \""I remember reading about Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) when he was the majority leader flying to Moscow during the negotiations over the SALT II treaty, explaining to the Russians the Senate\\'s role in treaty ratification. And John Kerry, when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism. So, look, members of Congress expressing themselves about important matters, not only at home, but around the world, is not unprecedented.\"".\nSince Kerry, many years later, is a central player in the Iran negotiations, we decided to focus on the claim that referenced him. (Indeed, on Sunday, Kerry said on CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Face the Nation that the letter from the 47 senators \""was absolutely calculated directly to interfere with these negotiations. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 That is unprecedented.\"").\nThere are some differences between the recent examples and the Kerry visit -- including the fact that the Nicaragua episode involved two individual lawmakers rather than , including the majority leader. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll leave it to readers to judge whether McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comparison is apt.\nHere, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look instead at the more straightforward factual question of whether Kerry, \""when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism.\"".\nWhen we dug into the archives, we found that the episode in question occurred almost exactly 30 years ago, in April 1985. It came at a time when Ortega, Nicaragua\\xe2\\x80\\x99s communist strongman, was being challenged by a U.S.-aligned rebel movement known as the Contras.

In reality, the AP article makes it clear that he made the statement in the days before he and Harkin left for Managua.\nSecond, McConnell could have been more precise in how he relayed Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of the word \""terrorism.\"" McConnell said Kerry \""accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism.\"" That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a slight exaggeration of Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words.

Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., said it was \""wrong, wrong, wrong\"" for Kerry and Harkin to visit Nicaragua the previous week and return with a negotiating proposal from President Daniel Ortega.\nAccording to the Post article, \""Kerry responded by reading a letter from Secretary of State George P.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., at a news conference on Capitol Hill on Sept. 13, 2017, where he unveiled his Medicare for All legislation. (AP/Andrew Harnik) .\nWhen a free-market think tank published its analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 single-payer health care plan, Republicans took to social media to tout the report\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most eye-popping finding.\n$32.6 trillion dollars. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how much Washington Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 single-payer healthcare proposal would cost over 10 years. Even doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cover this cost. It is just absurd. https://t.co/8jijG73wEw July 30, 2018 .\nIn a video he shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the report\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia.\nSanders said, \""Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center.\"".\nSanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical bills.\nSanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers.\nSkeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses.\nIn this article, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays.\nThe Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not hard to find the $2 trillion in question.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the difference between the Department of Health and Human Services\\xe2\\x80\\x99 projection of the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Medicare for All proposal. ( See Table 2 .).\nUnder Mercatus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system.\nCharles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent.\nHowever, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively ( see Table 4 ) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law.\nSanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bill \""indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance,\"" Blahous said. \""Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending.\"".\nBut would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution.\nSustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are \""not likely feasible,\"" said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \""pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically.\"".\nIn addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem.\nJosh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. \""Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care,\"" he said.\nIn cheekily thanking the Koch brothers, Sanders said a study they indirectly sponsored \""shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period.\"".\nThe $2 trillion figure can be traced back to the Mercatus report. But it is one of two scenarios the report offers, so Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 use of the term \""would\"" is too strong. The alternative figure, which assumes that a Medicare for All plan isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t as successful in controlling costs as its sponsors hope it will be, would lead to an increase of almost $3.3 trillion in national health care expenditures, not a decline.

Some Senators Want To Change That The Department of Defense had its first independent financial audit in 2017. After three failed attempts, lawmakers are losing their patience. A new bill could impose financial penalties on the DoD. .\n \""The Pentagon and the military industrial complex have been plagued by a massive amount of waste, fraud and financial mismanagement for decades.

That is absolutely unacceptable,\"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Carlos Barria/Reuters .\nWhen the Pentagon launched its first-ever independent financial audit back in 2017 , backers of accountability in government welcomed it as a major step for a department with a track record of financial boondoggles.\nBut the Defense Department failed that audit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and the next two as well. Now lawmakers are introducing a bipartisan bill that would impose a penalty for any part of the department, including the military, that fails to undergo a \""clean\"" audit.\n\""The Pentagon and the military industrial complex have been plagued by a massive amount of waste, fraud and financial mismanagement for decades. That is absolutely unacceptable,\"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who co-sponsored the bill with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, along with Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Mike Lee, R-Utah.\nDespite having trillions of dollars in assets and receiving hundreds of billions in federal dollars annually, the department has never detailed its assets and liabilities in a given year. For the past three financial years, the Defense Department\\'s audit has resulted in a \""Disclaimer of Opinion,\"" meaning the auditor didn\\'t get enough accounting records to form an assessment.\nThe new legislation, the Audit the Pentagon Act of 2021, would require any component of the Defense Department that fails to pass a clean audit to forfeit 1% of its budget back to the Treasury, to be applied against the federal deficit. The bill is slated to be introduced Wednesday.\nIn the lawmakers\\' eyes, the Pentagon\\'s inability to go through a successful independent audit is a major reason why the Defense Department has for years been associated with financial blunders and abuses. The Pentagon is expected to receive $740 billion in the current financial year, they note \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but it hasn\\'t been able to account for where all of its money goes.\n\""It\\'s absolutely insane, and I think it would shock a lot of people,\"" a senior aide to Sanders said in a background interview that was conducted shortly before the legislation was formally introduced. The aide spoke only on background to provide details about pending legislation.\nThe Pentagon blames some of the delay on is massive size: Its auditing process actually requires 24 stand-alone audits covering all the reporting entities in the DoD, along with a consolidated audit. The audits are performed by independent public accounting firms as well as the Department of Defense Inspector General.\nBut critics note that all federal agencies, including the Pentagon, have been under the same requirement to undergo an independent financial audit since the early 1990s. Every other federal department has satisfied audit requirements since fiscal 2013, when the Department of Homeland Security had its first clean audit .\n\""We\\'ve seen example after example of excessive and inefficient spending by the Pentagon, and every dollar squandered is a dollar not being used to support our men and women in uniform,\"" Grassley said in a statement. \""After 30 years to get ready, this bill pushes the Defense Department to finally achieve a clean annual audit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a requirement that every other federal agency is held to.\"".\nExamples of the problems abound, making it very difficult for Congress to conduct oversight of the largest recipient of federal discretionary spending.\n\""Right now, the Pentagon can\\'t even tell you where all of its buildings are located in the United States,\"" the senior aide to Sanders said.\nAnother big issue is that the Pentagon hasn\\'t been able to say how many contractors and subcontractors it employs. In 2018, it emerged that the Pentagon\\'s Defense Logistics Agency did not have a paper trail for more than $800 million in construction projects .\nA failed audit from one recent year \""uncovered a warehouse full of aircraft parts for planes that haven\\'t been used in over a decade,\"" the Sanders aide said.\nAnd then there\\'s the F-35, the notoriously expensive and controversial joint strike fighter jet. Despite costing more than $1.7 trillion in its estimated life cycle, attempts to audit the program have run into major hurdles.\n Attempts to audit the controversial and costly F-35A fighter jet program has been plagued with problems. George Frey/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption George Frey/Getty Images .\nIn its most recent audit report, the Pentagon said that its \""target date to achieve the desired end state\"" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in other words, to pass an overall audit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 won\\'t come until as late as the 2028 financial year, based on when it says it can carry out corrective actions that are listed in the report.\nThe department says it\\'s trying to improve, and its leaders say they\\'re learning from each failed attempt.

As of last fall, there were only 42 people known to be that old in the entire world. .\nBut Social Security does not have death records for millions of these people, with the oldest born in 1869, according to a report by the agency\u2019s inspector general.\\xc2\\xa0 .\nOnly 13 of the people are still getting Social Security benefits, the report said. But for others, their Social Security numbers are still active, so a number could be used to report wages, open bank accounts, obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds. .\n\u201cThat is a real problem,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. \u201cWhen you have a fake Social Security number, that\u2019s what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things, claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits.\u201d .\nJohnson is chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which plans a hearing Monday on problems with death records maintained by the Social Security Administration. .\nThe agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records. But it would be costly and time-consuming to update 6.5 million files that were generated decades ago, when the agency used paper records, said Sean Brune, a senior adviser to the agency\u2019s deputy commissioner for budget, finance, quality and management. .\nThe internal watchdog\u2019s report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these Social Security numbers. But it raises red flags that it could be happening. .\nFor example, nearly 67,000 of the Social Security numbers were used to report more than $3 billion in wages, tips and self-employment income from 2006 to 2011, according to the report. One Social Security number was used 613 different times. An additional 194 numbers were used at least 50 times each. .\nPeople in the country illegally often use fake or stolen Social Security numbers to get jobs and report wages, as do other people who do not want to be found by the government. Thieves use stolen Social Security numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds. .\nThe IRS estimated it paid out $5.8 billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft. The head of the Justice Department\u2019s tax division described how it\u2019s done at a recent congressional hearing. .\n\u201cThe plan is frighteningly simple \u2013 steal Social Security numbers, file tax returns showing a false refund claim, and then have the refunds electronically deposited or sent to an address where the offender can access the refund checks,\u201d said acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline Ciraolo. .\nIn some cases, she said, false tax returns are filed using Social Security numbers of deceased taxpayers or others who are not required to file. .\nThe Social Security Administration generates a list of dead people to help public agencies and private companies know when Social Security numbers are no longer valid for use. The list is called the Death Master File, which includes the name, Social Security number, date of birth and date of death for people who have died. .\nThe list is widely used by employers, financial firms, credit reporting agencies and security firms. Federal agencies and state and local governments rely on it to police benefit payments. .\nBut none of the 6.5 million people cited by the inspector general\u2019s report was on the list. The audit analyzed records as of 2013, looking for people with birth dates before 1901. .\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act in 1935, and the first old-age monthly benefit check was paid in 1940. .\nMany of the people cited in the inspector general\u2019s report never received benefits, though they were assigned Social Security numbers so spouses and children could receive them, presumably after they died. .\nThe agency says it has corrected death information in more than 200,000 records. But fixing the entire list would be costly and time-consuming because Social Security needs proof that a person is dead to add them to the death list, said Brune, the agency official. .\nBrune noted that the inspector general\u2019s report did not verify that any of the 6.5 million people are actually dead. Instead, the report assumed they are dead because of their advanced age. .\n\u201cWe can\u2019t post information to our records based on presumption,\u201d Brune said. \u201cWe post information to our records based on evidence, and in this case it would be evidence of a death certificate.\u201d .\nNearly all the Social Security numbers are from paper records generated before the agency started using electronic records in 1972, Brune said. Many of the records contain errors, with multiple birthdates and bits of information about different family members. .\n\u201cBut our focus right now is to make sure our data is as accurate and complete as it can be for our current program purpose,\u201d said Brune. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re focused on making sure we\u2019re paying beneficiaries properly, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re investing our resources at this time.\u201d .\n Left: A man examines his Social Security paperwork. A new internal watchdog report released its findings that Social security does not hold death records for more than six million people.

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s especially remarkable when you consider that the says it knew of 42 people in the world who were alive last October at 112 or older. Fifteen of them lived in the U.S.\nWarner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office pointed us to a March 4 issued by Patrick O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Carroll Jr., the Social Security Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inspector general. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Carroll testified about the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death records during a March 16 hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used.\nThe agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a \""Death Master File\"" with nearly 90 million electronic records that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud.\nSometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recently on CBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead.\nAnd sometimes the opposite is true, O\\'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when \\xc2\\xa0the agency has been informed of the deaths.\nIt all came to a head a few years ago when O\\'Carroll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation.\nThe auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records.\nThe good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, \""thousands\"" of the numbers \""could have been used\"" to commit other types of identity fraud.\nAuditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports.\nThat means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S.\nFinal notes: If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing is of Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23. \\xc2\\xa0The oldest man is of Japan, who turned 112 in February.\nThe verified oldest person ever was of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years, 164 days old. The oldest man was of Denmark, who died in 1998 at 115 years, 252 days.\nWarner said the Social Security Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Inspector General found \""there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older.\"".\nThe audit Warner cites indeed found that there are an implausible 6.5 million active Social Security numbers belonging to people who would be at least 112.\nSocial Security Administration Inspector General Patrick P.

Andrew Harnik/Pool via Reuters.\nJoe Biden, the president-elect of the United States, addressed the nation Saturday night after the tumultuous and historic election against Donald Trump came to a conclusion earlier in the day.\nBiden, a son of Scranton, Pennsylvania, fittingly garnered the final electoral votes he needed to go back to the White House as the apparent winner of the Keystone State, according to ABC News analysis.\nThe man who served alongside the first Black president for eight years is making history again, bringing along the first female vice president in Kamala Harris , riding a shift in independent voters, many of whom chose Trump in 2016 but made a different choice this time around.\nNearly 50 years into his political career and two unsuccessful presidential runs later, Biden is set to ascend to the highest office in the land amid the historic coronavirus pandemic , deep political divisions among the electorate and simmering racial unrest, all of which converged on the country in the months leading up to the election.\nBiden, who suffered deep losses over the course of his life, including his son Beau, pledged to be a president to all Americans and push to heal the deep divisions in the U.S.\n\""I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify,\"" he told the ecstatic crowed in Delaware, the state he represented in the Senate for decades. \""Who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States.\nHello. My fellow Americans and the people who brought me to the dance, Delawareans. I see my buddy Tom -- Sen. Tom Carper down there and I think -- I think Sen. Coons is there and I think the governor's around. Is that Ruth Ann? And that former Gov. Ruth Ann Minner? Most importantly, my sisters in law and my sister Valerie. Anyway ...\nFolks, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won with the most votes ever cast on a presidential ticket in the history of the nation, 74 million!.\nAnd what I must admit has surprised me, tonight we're seeing all over this nation, all cities in all parts of the country, indeed across the world, an outpouring of joy, of hope of renewed faith in tomorrow, bring a better day. And I'm humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden points a finger at his election rally, after news media announced that he won the presidential election, in Wilmington, Del., Nov. 7, 2020.\nI pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide but unify. Who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States. And work with all my heart with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you. And for that is what America I believe is about. It's about people. And that's what our administration will be all about.\nI sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again. And to unite us here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision. And now, the work of making that vision is real, it's a task -- the task of our time.\nFolks, as I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband. And I would not be here without the love and tireless support of Jill and my son Hunter and Ashley, my daughter, and all our grandchildren and their spouses and all our family. They're my heart. Jill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mom, a military mom, an educator.\nAnd she has dedicated her life to education, but teaching isn't just what she does. It's who she is. For American educators, this is a great day for y'all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House. And Jill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna make a great first lady. I'm so proud of her.\nI'll have the honor of serving with a fantastic vice president who you just heard from, Kamala Harris, who makes history as the first woman, first black woman, the first woman from south Asian descent, the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and his wife Jill wave to the crowd after speaking at his election rally, after the news media announced that Biden has won the presidential election, in Wilmington, Del., Nov. 7, 2020.\nDon't tell me it's not possible in the United States! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long overdue. And we're reminded tonight of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe more towards justice. Kamala, Doug, like it or not, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re family. You've become an honorary Biden. There's no way out.\nTo all those of you who volunteered and worked the polls in the middle of this pandemic, local elected officials, you deserve a special thanks from the entire nation. And to my campaign team and all the volunteers and all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. I owe you. I owe you. I owe you everything. And to all those who supported us, I'm proud of the campaign we built and ran.\nI'm proud of the coalition we put together. The broadest and most diverse coalition in history. Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young, old, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white, Latino, Asian, Native American. I mean it. Especially those moments -- and especially those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb, the African American community stood up again for me.\nYou always had my back and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have yours. I said at the outset, I wanted to represent -- this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that. Now that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I want the administration to look like and act like. For all those of you who voted president trump, I understand the disappointment tonight.\nI've lost a couple of times myself, but now let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. They are Americans. They are Americans.\nThe Bible tells us, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto everything there is a season: a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow and a time to heal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over, what is the will of the people? What is our mandate?.\nI believe it's this: Americans have called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness, to marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope in the great battles of our time. The battle to control the virus. The battle to build prosperity. The battle to secure your family's health care. The battle to achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country.\nAnd the battle to save our planet by getting climate under control. The battle to restore decency, defend democracy, and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for, a fair shot. Folks, our work begins with getting COVID under control.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is greeted on stage by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris before he speaks in Wilmington, Del., Saturday, Nov. 7, 2020.\nWe cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality or relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help take the Biden-Harris COVID plan and convert it into an action blueprint that will start on January the 20, 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science.\nIt will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American president.\nI'll work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as those who did. Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now. The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not some mysterious force beyond our control.\nIt's a decision. A choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people.\nThey want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, to make that choice with me. The American story is about slow yet steadily widening the opportunities in America. And make no mistake, too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country real for everybody, no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability.\nFolks, America has always been shaped by inflection points, by moments in time where we've made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be. Lincoln in 1860 coming to save the union. FDR in 1932 promising a beleaguered country a new deal. JFK in 1960 pledging a new frontier, and 12 years ago, when Barack Obama made history, he told us, \""Yes, we can.\"".\nWell folks, we stand at an inflection point. We have an opportunity to defeat despair, to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it. I know we can.\nI've long talked about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America. Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels and our darkest impulses. And what presidents say in this battle matters. It's time for our better angels to prevail. Tonight, the whole world is watching America. And I believe at our best, America is a beacon for the globe.\nWe will not lead -- we will lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. I know, I've always believed, many have you heard me say it, I've always believed we can define America in one word: possibilities. That in America everyone should be given an opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is accompanied on the stage by his wife Jill, and members of their family, after speaking in Wilmington, Del., Nov. 7, 2020.\nYou see, I believe in the possibility of this country. We're always looking ahead, ahead to an America that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s freer, more just. Ahead to an America that creates jobs with dignity and respect. Ahead to an America that cures diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. Ahead to an America that never leaves anyone behind.\nAhead to an America that never gives up, never gives in. This is a great nation. It's always been a bad bet to bet against America. We're good people. This is the United States of America, and there has never been anything, never been anything we've been able -- not able to do when we've done it together.\nFolks, in the last days of the campaign, I began thinking about a hymn that means a lot to me and my family, particularly my deceased son Beau. It captures the faith that sustains me and which I believe sustains America. And I hope, and I hope it can provide some comfort and solace to the 230 million -- thousand Americans who have lost a loved one through this terrible virus this year. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this hymn gives you solace as well. It goes like this.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd he will raise you up on eagles' wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you to shine like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And now together on eagles' wings, we embark on the work that God and history have called us to do with full hearts and steady hands, with faith in America and in each other, with love of country, a thirst for justice. Let us be the nation that we know we can be. A nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed.\nThe United States of America, ladies and gentlemen, there has never, never been anything we've tried we've not been able to do. So remember, as my grandpop -- our grandpop, he said when I walked out of his home when I was kid up in Scranton, he said \""Joey, keep the faith.\"" And our grandmother when she was alive, she yelled, \""No, Joey, spread it.\"".\nSpread the faith. God love you all. May god bless America and may god protect our troops.

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa pivoted in messaging, initially criticizing efforts to include any add-ons to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program, but later said she pushed for hospital and COVID-19 testing that was included in replenishing the PPE funds. .\nThe Iowa Democratic Party claims in its 2020 campaign against U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief plan 3.5 , which offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing.\nThe Iowa Democratic Party claimed in the headline of an April 21 statement that Ernst opposed funding for hospitals and COVID-19 testing for weeks before $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing was included in an interim coronavirus relief bill passed by the Senate April 21 and signed by President Trump April 24. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a claim Democrats have continued to make against Ernst.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats blocked interim economic relief packages proposed by the other party in April before the final half-a-trillion-dollar package cleared the Senate. The Republicans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 proposal would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve solely funded the quickly depleted Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and launched April 4 for businesses that keep employees on their payroll. Democrats pushed for a $500-billion-dollar-plus aid package with Paycheck Protection Program funds as well as $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local government , of which some of the hospital funds made it into the final deal.\nIowa Democratic Party Communications Director Jeremy Busch referred in an interview with The Daily Iowan to a series of interviews and public statements Ernst made in April as proof her tune had changed on the expanded relief funding.\\xc2\\xa0.\nAs negotiations on refilling the Paycheck Protection Program were ongoing, Ernst said in an April 16 Fox News interview she supported the program and disagreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Congress should wait.\n\""We have small businesses that desperately need this funding to keep their employees on payroll. If they can\\'t do that, those employees will go unemployed and that is not the route. So, I do believe that what we had was a narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP, but the Democrats wanted to hijack it with unrelated items and additional changes. We have a program that\\'s working, now we need to make sure that it\\'s properly funded.\"".\nIn an email to the Daily Iowan\\'s PolitiFact Iowa, Ernst\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spokesperson, Brendan Conley, wrote that Ernst\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comment on \""unrelated items and additional changes\"" referred to an early House version of what eventually became the CARES Act, the third relief bill. The version Conley referred to was noted in a March 23 article in the Hill ; it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clear the Senate but included funding to curb airline pollution. However, the Paycheck Protection Program launched after that article, on April 3 , as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, making it unlikely that the narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP referred to the measure that created the loan program.\nThe proposal that better fits what Ernst is describing in the Fox News interview would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve bumped up funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asked senators on April 9 to approve with unanimous consent a measure that would have added $250 million in federal funds to the Paycheck Protection Program. He argued on the Senate floor that the small business loan program\\'s funds were running out and that negotiations for hospital, local government, and test funding should be part of a separate congressional package at a later date. The reason: the extra funding wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pass unanimously, he said.\nHowever, McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s measure did not receive unanimous consent, as two Democrats voiced opposition. No formal recorded vote was taken to gauge Senate support for the initial proposal, so there\\'s no formal record of Ernst\\'s support or opposition to that measure.\nMinutes after the two Democratic senators from Maryland rejected McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ask to fast-track the measure, the pair proposed their own amendment which was double the dollar figure of McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. It included $100 billion for hospitals dealing with COVID-19 and $150 billion for state and local governments.\\xc2\\xa0.\nA final proposal to McConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original interim bill included $500 billion for hospitals, the Paycheck Protection Program and COVID-19 testing, but none for local government. The Senate approved that measure April 21 with unanimous consent, a procedural fast-tracking move that means no senators voiced opposition. Again, the Senate didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t record a vote tally, but Conley wrote to the DI in an email that Ernst supported that half-a-trillion-dollar bill.\nA day before the final proposal was approved in the Senate, Ernst said in an April 20 town hall, that she supported the $3.5 coronavirus relief bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extra $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\n\""We will also get the additional dollars we wanted for diagnostic testing an additional $25 billion there as well as another $75 billion for our hospitals.

Her voting record shows, in no uncertain terms, that she supports those measures.\"".\nAccording to a RadioIowa report, Ernst said April 16 that discussions about extra funding for hospitals and local governments could wait until Congress passed the PPP funds.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""No political gimmicks, just a simple ask to put more money in this program,\"" RadioIowa reported Ernst saying. \""Unfortunately, politics got in the way.\"".\nIn a statement from Ernst\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office April 9 , the day Democrats and Republicans rejected each others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interim relief plans, Ernst criticized Democrats for rejecting Republicans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 proposal, stating that passing small business loan relief funds was too urgent to delay.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""After hearing from Iowans and seeing the overwhelming response of small businesses across the country, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear we need to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time for political games; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a crisis. Workers and employers in Iowa and across the country need this relief now more than ever, so let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s put aside the politics and swiftly get this specific additional support for small businesses approved so money can keep flowing, Iowa workers can continue to collect a paycheck, and our state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small businesses can stay afloat,\"" Ernst said.\nCongress put $350 billion toward the PPP at it\\'s creation. The program stopped taking applications when the funds ran dry April 16 date, and resumed taking applications April 27 .\nThe Iowa Democratic Party claimed that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief in a recent bill that offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing.\nDue to a lack of concrete voting record, we reviewed Ernst\\'s statements before and after the passage of the interim coronavirus-relief bill.\\xc2\\xa0.\nErnst hasn\\'t said she directly opposed hospital funding, but in public statements she was critical of putting a proposal on the floor with funding that was more broad than the Paycheck Protection Program.\nWhen Democrats brought their version of the interim relief proposal, which included extra dollars for hospitals and local government, to the senate floor April 9, McConnell objected. Ernst is the Vice Chair of the Senate GOP Conference, meaning she is part of Republican leadership.\nHowever, she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vote down additional funds for hospitals or COVID-19 testing in the final half-a-trillion-dollar package. She said later she pushed for hospital funding included in the interim relief package. But, she never said she directly opposed that funding.

The program stopped taking applications when the funds ran dry April 16 date, and resumed taking applications April 27 .\nThe Iowa Democratic Party claimed that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief in a recent bill that offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing.\nDue to a lack of concrete voting record, we reviewed Ernst\\'s statements before and after the passage of the interim coronavirus-relief bill.\\xc2\\xa0.\nErnst hasn\\'t said she directly opposed hospital funding, but in public statements she was critical of putting a proposal on the floor with funding that was more broad than the Paycheck Protection Program.\nWhen Democrats brought their version of the interim relief proposal, which included extra dollars for hospitals and local government, to the senate floor April 9, McConnell objected. Ernst is the Vice Chair of the Senate GOP Conference, meaning she is part of Republican leadership.\nHowever, she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vote down additional funds for hospitals or COVID-19 testing in the final half-a-trillion-dollar package. She said later she pushed for hospital funding included in the interim relief package. But, she never said she directly opposed that funding.

Joni Ernst for votes they say could have limited the nation\\'s top health agency\\'s ability to respond to health threats, including coronavirus. .\nIowa Forward, in partnership with Progress Iowa, is debuting a $2.5 million ad campaign on digital platforms and, possibly later on television, calling out Ernst for votes they say could have eliminated $1 billion in funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. .\nThe first ad, \\' Here We Are ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which begins airing today, highlights Ernst\\'s vote to eliminate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s Prevention and Public Health Fund. Without that funding, CDC said it ability to \\'detect, prevent, and respond to health threats\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would be crippled. .\nThe Prevention and Public Health Fund supports heart disease and stroke prevention, immunization, lead poisoning prevention and diabetes prevention, mostly through grants to states and local programs, according to the CDC. .\n\\'The health and safety of Iowans depends on us having every necessary tool at our disposal to fight this global pandemic,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mazie Stilwell, spokeswoman for Iowa Forward. .\nErnst\\'s vote against those funds \\'put Iowans in harm\\'s way\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by leaving the CDC ill-equipped to deal with the current public health emergency that has claimed nearly 600 Iowa lives to date. .\n\\'Iowans deserve to know when their senator is voting against their best interest, especially when so many lives are on the line,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stilwell said. .\nThe attack is a non-starter, according to Ernst\\'s campaign, because Ernst \\'voted to, and actually did, increase funding for the CDC.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nCampaign spokesman Brendan Donley said Ernst voted for the 2020 fiscal year appropriations bill that included a $2.6 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health and a $636.8 million increase for CDC. .\n\\'Once again, Theresa Greenfield is relying on outside money to deceive Iowans and spread proven falsehoods,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Conley said, referring to Ernst\\'s Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 general election. .\nMultiple fact-checks, including by the Associated Press and The Gazette , \\'have shown that Joni Ernst voted to and successfully did increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the National Institutes of Health,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. .\nHowever, Iowa Forward and Progress point to Ernst\\'s 2017 vote for the so-called \\'skinny repeal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Affordable Care Act that would have abolished the individual mandate. It also included a $1 billion cut to the Prevention and Public Health Fund. It failed, 51-49, in the GOP-controlled House. .\nThe CDC is vital to the nation\\'s pandemic response as well as day-to-day public health, according to Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician from Fort Dodge. .\n\\'From providing guidance for medical professionals to instructing the public on personal safety measures, our communities are better equipped to handle this coronavirus crisis because of the work done by the CDC,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Srinivas said. .\n\\'The work of the CDC should be at the forefront of our elected officials\\' minds when they are making budget decisions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Srinivas said. \\'Eliminating, or even attempting to eliminate, these appropriations is irresponsible for our public health.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIn 2017, the outgoing Obama administration conducted an exercise on pandemic response for the incoming Trump administration showing that the United States was not ready for a pandemic. .\nCalling Ernst\\'s 2017 vote for the so-called \\'skinny repeal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Obamacare \\'reckless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\'appalling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Progress Iowa Executive Director Matt Sinovic said her actions put Iowans\\' health at risk during a pandemic. .\nSen.

We need your help. .\nUp to 234,000 Wisconsin residents are at risk of being removed from the voter rolls, a political lightning-rod that has drawn national attention given the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s critical role in the 2020 presidential election.\nWisconsin election officials believe those people may have moved, so they sent letters inquiring about their status in October. A series of ensuing lawsuits and court actions have sought to more quickly remove these people from the voting rolls -- or delay that from happening.\nA Twitter account described as Pelosi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""political account\"" retweeted a statement from Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler and then offered its own take on the situation.\nThe tweet does not appear to have been sent by Pelosi herself, since it was not signed with her initials, a style referenced in the account\\xc2\\xa0 description .\nThe controversy began in October 2019 when the Wisconsin Elections Commission sent letters to 234,000 voters it believed may have moved because of information it received from the post office, Division of Motor Vehicles or other government entities. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 7% of the 3.3\\xc2\\xa0million registered voters in the state.\nThe letters asked recipients to re-register at their new address if they had moved or to confirm they were still at their same address if they hadn\\'t.\nAll of this is a big deal in Wisconsin, a state President\\xc2\\xa0 Donald Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, a key factor in his victory.\nOfficials have refused to release the names of those who received the letters, but a\\xc2\\xa0 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis of the mailings showed 55% went to municipalities won by Democrat\\xc2\\xa0 Hillary Clinton in 2016. A higher percentage of voters received the mailings in traditional Democratic strongholds, such as Milwaukee, Madison and many college towns.\nMap shows the distribution by county of letters sent by the Wisconsin Elections Commission in an effort to clean up Wisconsin voter rolls. About 55% of mailers were sent to municipalities that supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. (Letters sent to municipalities that bridge multiple counties were counted in the county where most of the population lives) .\n The 2020 election could not have been fair because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLos Angeles County agreed, during litigation, that there were 1.2 million ineligible voters after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nState officials want to put off forcing people off the rolls until 2021, not wanting to affect the 2020 election since they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t certain all of those people actually moved.\nIndeed, as of Dec. 5, 2019, the Elections Commission said 2,300 recipients had responded to the letter to report they still lived at the same address. By that point, 16,500 recipients had also registered to vote at new addresses, and 60,000 letters had been returned as undeliverable.\nBut a lawsuit brought in November by three voters with the help of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty argued election officials were required to remove voters from the rolls 30 days after sending the letters if they hadn\\'t heard from them.\nFour days later, Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed notice the state would appeal and seek to stay the judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling. The same day, the left-leaning League of Women Voters of Wisconsin filed suit in federal court to try to stop voter names from being purged.\nBut anyone in this group has multiple opportunities to regain their status as registered voters. Voters who are removed from the rolls \\xe2\\x80\\x94 correctly or not \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can re-register online , at their clerk\\'s office or even at the polls on Election Day.\nWisconsin is one of 21 states that allows voters to register at their polling place the day of the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nAddressing this at the polls would mean filling out paperwork and providing proof of residence such as a driver\\'s license, property tax bill, utility bill, bank statement, paycheck stub, lease or workplace ID. That means some people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have no idea how many \\xe2\\x80\\x94 could be unable to vote if they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provide proof of residence at the polls and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t re-register beforehand.\nThe Pelosi tweet was made in the context of the 2020 election, but the next chance for Wisconsin residents to vote is the spring primary on Feb. 18, 2020. So it does leave a narrow window to get reregistered before the election.\n\""This mailing is designed to help people who may have moved within Wisconsin make sure they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready to vote next year,\""\\xc2\\xa0 said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief elections official. \""It will not keep anyone eligible from voting.\""\\xc2\\xa0.\nWhen asked for evidence supporting the tweet, a Pelosi spokesman acknowledged the ability to re-register but largely reiterated the same overstated claim.\n\""Of course, if people re-register, they will be able to vote,\"" said Jorge Aguilar. \""If the purge goes through, people will be de-registered and not be allowed to vote.\"".\nYes, the pruning process \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if allowed by the courts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 could potentially remove more than 200,000 people from the voting rolls before the upcoming elections. But there is no punitive element that would ban future voting. Everyone can re-register, even on Election Day.\nThe use of the word \""prohibited,\"" in particular, goes too far, in that it suggests there is no way to vote in the future.\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Effort to stop removal of 234K voter registrations heads to federal court, while attorney general tries to stall purge in state court , Dec. 17, 2019.\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, A judge ordered the state to purge more than 200,000 voters from the rolls.

I was ready to go to battle with the bigwigs. .\nThe reactions were swift and merciless, one (gay) agent writing me that, although the show was funny, the characters were depraved, the language vile, the sexual references unthinkable for a mainstream, albeit cable TV, audience. Among dozens of offenses listed, he said that no one will watch a leading man make a joke about bottoming. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care the heroes who show how far the community has progressed?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe show, about a fifty-year-old gay man struggling to overcome alcoholism, narcissism, and a sex-addicted past, and set against the backdrop of his tumbling L.A. writing career, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meant to be the next \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis Is Us\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or even \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a rare age-friendly dramedy filled with gay sex scenes. And, for the record, there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a snippet of nudity in the pilot. It was meant as a humorous, albeit dark, take on a generation of men who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grow up with marriage as an option, or kids, or mainstream visibility, or sexual conformity. It was meant to be a show about people like me. .\nAlthough I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been writing forever\\xe2\\x80\\x94with all the insults such a career involves\\xe2\\x80\\x94and have penned four screenplays in the past two years, the criticisms for this piece hit me like bricks because they were a direct affront to the last generation of unbridled, yet restricted, gay men who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve survived despite a former pandemic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to kill every last one. .\nI rarely see my 56-year-old reflection on television unless the stories are set in the past, whether as closeted men or AIDS victims. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tragic, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m desirable. Russell T. Davies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 much -ballyhooed and marvelous \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Sin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d expertly showed the brutality\\xe2\\x80\\x94and fun\\xe2\\x80\\x94that mirrors my own youth as an actor in San Francisco. Ever want to know what happened to the men who escaped the holocaust? The networks don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. The men of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQueer As Folk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Davies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 previous TV offering) were viewed from a mostly heart-rending standpoint, not surprising given it premiered during the AIDS-aftershock millennium. They were the Boys in the Band with condoms, not handkerchiefs, in their back pockets. In modern times, Will Truman was the first man out and, ironically, the last. And even he was somewhat asexual.\nWith the rise of TV anti-heroes like Tony Soprano and Walter White, and a fondness for darker, more complicated characters in general, I thought, naively, that a mature, gay male lead would be welcomed in the same manner. In 2021 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all equals now, right? Don Draper slept his way around New York, and no one batted an eye. Christina Applegate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Jen Harding on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDead to Me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d smokes and swears and drinks too much and even kills a guy. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also the character you root for each episode. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Flight Attendant,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hero Cassie Bowden (Kaley Christine Cuoco) guzzles vodka and one-night-stands her way around the globe, but she at least has her sainted, gay, married with children, older brother, Davey (T.R. Knight), to bail her out. Supporting gays as saints or sinners are always welcome. But show a grown gay man happily admit to taking Truvada and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve set the TV set on fire. .\nAs far as media debauchery goes, negative reactions to bad behavior in my script shocked me, because I naively that should be a no-brainer these days. Graphic sex and language exist on pretty much everything around, from teen melodramas (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEuphoria\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) to plush period pieces (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBridgerton\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmerican Horror Story: Hotel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d showed a man get, literally, f***** to death with a drill dildo, and if Ryan Murphy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name is at the helm, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re almost always guaranteed a good dose of tight tush. It felt at times like there was more full-frontal nudity on Hulu\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNormal People\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than there was dialogue or plot. Yes, somehow, grown gay men who admit to once having paid for sex are anathema to our puritanical gay morals. .\nThe problem with putting gay men my age in the spotlight isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re attracted to, and having relations with, the same sex (thank people like Murphy and others for helping to break that TV barrier). It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re untidy in our packaging\\xe2\\x80\\x94just like in real life. Coming out, getting married and raising kids, and living our best Instagram lives is not always the whole story. We were canceled on television before Cancel Culture became a thing.\nOf the hundreds of gay men I met and befriended when I came out at the young age of sixteen, roughly twenty of them survived AIDS. We were the last generation defined by sex, and as we shook off the residue of lovers and friends, we learned to adjust to a world where HIV wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a death sentence, where we could be seen in public with our dates, where we could be equals both in the workplace and domestic life. Our lives became three-dimensional if not living-our-best-lives hashtag-able. .\nIn the process, older gay men are often seen (or not seen, as it were) as relics, tugged by contrasting authenticities. We fought and died for marriage and rights, for conformity, but still often believe in open relationships, still work out like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1999, and celebrate PrEP and U = U like the second coming of The Roxy. .\nSince our generation grew up in a time when Pride often meant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cParty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d endorsed by every gay rag at our reach, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also chockfull of recovery programs and relationship PTSD. Think of us as the vets who returned home to a world that found it easier to ignore than engage. .\nThe gays of my generation are also wicked smart and fascinating, as all survivors are. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of our complexities that our lives should be celebrated in the present tense, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of our legacy that people will pay attention. In case my media references weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t enough of a clue, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re vast consumers of pop culture, searching for signs of our life on screen the way we used to search for bars with a rainbow flag above.\nThe men I grew up with no longer need to be seen by the media as unflinching or perfect, nor do our flawed selves need to be reduced to fit into anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mold of a queer hero. We spent our entire youth pretending to be someone else, and our only request is that you now allow us to grow up in that fashion that suits us. Let us act our age as well as our history. As every gay man over the age of fifty knows, we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just live through death; we discovered the life that comes afterward. .\nDavid Toussaint is the writer of five screenplays (with six film festival awards between them) and four best-selling non-fiction books. A professional journalist since the age of 15, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s written for such publications as Huffington Post, Queerty, and Conde Nast Traveler.

Its a fool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s errand to expect mainstream \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpowers that be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to give two shits about LGBTQ representation, either over or under 50. Reply.\nI find it rather strange that some, not only gay men, feel the need to see \\xe2\\x80\\x9csomeone who looks like me\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the mass media to feel validated. Reply.\nAs a 64 year old gay male, I have often thought about about the fact that my generation grew up without \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarriage as an option, or kids, or mainstream visibility, or sexual conformity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hell, it was a revelation to me in my mid-to-late 20s, even as a college graduate, that gay men were allowed to be something more than actor-model-waiters. I was socialized into and in the gay \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommunity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (whatever that means or has meant), to believe that the only value we had for one another was as sexual objects and, sometimes, as friends.\nLike so many others in my age range, we went out into the workplace and fought for the rights and dignity and respect that we not only expected but demanded. Yet while this writer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposed show is about about a fifty-year-old gay man struggling to overcome alcoholism, narcissism, and a sex-addicted past, and set against the backdrop of his tumbling L.A. writing career, forgive me but we have heard these themes and dealt with these issues as not only gay men but seen many a straight person deal with the same issues, that the plot line isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all that compelling to me.\nThe show may be about people \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the author, but this is in some ways and, in many others, is not about people like me. Mr. Toussaint writes about surviving the 80s and 9os \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdespite a former pandemic\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to kill every last one [of us].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To me, that would make a way more compelling show. I published a story on my website and blog about being in a bar in Atlanta, where I live, in the spring of 1985 and some friends coming up to me and saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you heard about the new gay cancer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d My response was, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGay cancer? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the dumbest thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever heard of. How does a cancer cell know if you are gay or not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That, of course would be analogous to those who today seem to think COVID knows whether you are a Democrat or Republican, but I digress.\nMany of us who lived through and survived that period were bruised and battered and scarred by the experience. We had to confront, in the early days of that pandemic, the notion that maybe this was God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s punishment for who and what we were.\nI would agree with the author that over time, gay characters have become more nuanced, more three-dimensional, more human, as portrayed in popular culture. I also agree with the author that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI rarely see my [64]-year-old reflection on television unless the stories are set in the past, whether as closeted men or AIDS victims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hell, when I was in my 20s, the pre-AIDs era, gay male characters still had to die or as a roommate of mine at the time said regarding TV and movies at the time, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only good faggot, is a dead faggot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To my dying day I will never forget how the truth of that realization hit me, as well as how offended I was by that fact.\nThe author writes, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were canceled on television before Cancel Culture became a thing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Well, no, Dear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As I wrote in a recent blog post entitled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCancel Culture & Smiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the truth is, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGay men are well aware of this phenomena. Gay men have been practicing cancel culture forever \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and doing so in broad daylight so it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t new to us. Cancel culture, behaving as if someone or something does not exist and/or does not have the right to exist. If you are not pretty enough, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a good enough body, have the wrong skin color, are too old, not wearing the proper trendy clothes, etc., you are toast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nFor my money, a series about what we have done to one another for decades \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and continue to do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 would be a much more compelling show or series. I know all about being invisible to other gay men. And now at 64 with a 36 inch waist, thinning hair \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at least I still have most of my own teeth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 trust me when I tell you, I understand being cancelled by gay men from decades of experience. I would like to see a show about those of us who still have a lot to offer others \\xe2\\x80\\x93 physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and how what we have to offer has been informed by surviving what we have been through, than something that goes back to the well-documented and discussed themes of alcoholism, narcissism, and a sex-addiction. No offense meant to anyone reading this, just some thoughts. Best wishes to all.

Most served prison sentences. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 were sent to concentration camps. Those homosexuals who survived found liberation by British and American soldiers of short duration. As criminals under Germany\u2019s notorious Paragraph 175 penal code they were sent back to prison. Many died there. The purging of Berlin gay bars began in February 1933. There were 90 such clubs in a city where sex, following World War l, was a commodity to barter. The Nazis prohibited sex publications and manuals, banned organized homophile groups, and they also outlawed abortions. In May, the Berlin Nazi Youth made an organized attack of the Magnus Hirschfeld Institute of Sex Research. Its collection of 20,000 books, 5,000 photographs and sex artifacts were burned. Kurt Hiller, director, was sent to a concentration camp. Hirschfeld founder, and an advocate for Paragraph 175 repeal, was out of the country. He died in France. Treatment of homosexuals in concentration camps was brutal. Gays \u201cranked\u201d below political prisoners, criminals, asocials, Roma \u2013 gypsies \u2013 and Jehovah Witnesses. Gad Beck, who died last year at age 88, was what the 1935 Nuremberg Jewish Law classified as a \u201cmischling\u201d \u2013 half Jew, half gentile. This status allowed him to live openly longer than most full Jews. He was also a courageous underground resistance fighter, at one point even daring to try to rescue his Jewish lover from certain concentration camp death. Beck stole a German Youth uniform, entered the Auschwitz camp, and requested the release of his friend for a nonexistent defense project. Beck\u2019s pretense worked. His friend was granted escorted exit; but then told Beck with much sorrow and a strong sense of family loyalty that he could not leave his parents behind. Returning to Auschwitz, he and his family perished. An account by another Holocaust survivor, Pierre Seel, details life for gay men during Nazi control. He relates participating in his local homophile community in the town of Mulhouse. When the Nazis took control his name was found on a list of local homosexuals. He was ordered to the police station, obeying the directive to protect his family from any retaliation. Upon arriving at the police station he says that he and other homosexuals were repeatedly beaten. Any who resisted the SS Gestapo brutes had their fingernails torn out. Others had their bowels punctured, causing them to bleed profusely. After his arrest he was sent to the concentration camp at Schirmeck. There, Seel shares that during a morning roll-call, the Nazi commander announced a public execution. A man was brought out, and Seel recognized his face. It was that of his eighteen-year-old lover from Mulhouse. The Nazi guards then stripped the clothes off his lover, placed a metal bucket over his head, board banged it repeatedly, then released trained German Shepherd dogs to maul and tear him to death. Rudolf Brazda, believed to be the last surviving person who was sent to a Nazi concentration camp because of his homosexuality, died in France in August 2011, aged 98. Brazda was sent to Buchenwald in August 1942 and held there as Pink Triangle # 7952, until its liberation by U.S. forces in 1945. Brazda, who settled in France after the war, was in 2010 awarded the Legion of Honour, for his varied roles in speaking out about Nazi treatment of homosexuals and France\u2019s shameful role in deporting its Jews and homosexuals. In 1994, 17 years before Brazda\u2019s death, Germany rescinded its anti-gay Paragraph 175. .\nLatest News The Complete Timeline of LGBTQ+ Civil Rights Expansion in Michigan, 50 Years in the Making Hero Parent Challenges Christian Fascist Book Ban in the Most Epic Way Imaginable This Detroit Opera Production on Federico Garc\\xc3\\xada Lorca Bulldozes the Gender Binary Hopefully, Matteo Lane Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Hate This Interview Photographer Charzette Torrence, Dead at 59, Helped Shape the Visual Image of Black Queerness in Detroit In the Closet: Stellar Style Pieces for Spring ."", ""evidence"": ""Those homosexuals who survived found liberation by British and American soldiers of short duration."", ""nli_class"": ""entailment"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.89869785""}, {""snippet"": ""OP, even though I lived through the 80s, I can only give you anecdotal evidence. <b>And all I can say is that i know many gay men, including myself, who survived (including some who became positive very early on and are still with us), and also know many gay men who died.</b> by Anonymous reply 3 January 31, 2013 11:46 PM ."", ""url"": ""https://datalounge.com/thread/12415155-what-percentage-of-gay-men-died-of-aids-during-the-80-s-"", ""title"": ""What percentage of gay men died of AIDS during the 80\\'s?"", ""full_text"": ""Hello and thank you for being a DL contributor.

But is the science unsettled on whether young people should receive the vaccine or wear masks at school, as Elder claims?\\xc2\\xa0.\nNumerous leading scientific organizations recommend children, ages 12 and up, should receive the vaccine and wear masks at school to protect their health and slow the pandemic.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWe found the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Federal Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend young people receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\""The data continue to show that this vaccine is safe and effective,\"" said Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a press release in May. \""I urge all parents to call their pediatrician to learn more about how to get their children and teens vaccinated.\"".\nElder was correct in the CNN interview when he said that children tend to get more mild cases of COVID-19 than adults and are not hospitalized at the same rate. But cases are rising sharply among adolescents as the delta variant spreads across the country.\\xc2\\xa0.\nNationally, nearly 94,000 child cases of COVID-19 were recorded for the week ending Aug. 5, up from 72,000 cases the week before and up from 39,000 two weeks earlier, NPR reported , based on data from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\\'s Hospital Association.\nOn its website, the CDC recommends \""everyone 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 vaccination to help protect against COVID-19.\"" It describes the vaccine as \\xc2\\xa0 safe and effective , and a critical tool to help stop the pandemic.\nWe also looked at Elder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \""believe the science suggests\"" young people should be vaccinated in the context of children under 12. For this group, we found the examination of vaccine data isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t complete, but no indication that vaccines will be unsafe for these younger children once authorized.\\xc2\\xa0.\nAs many parents of young children know, the COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been authorized for kids under 12 because the FDA is still collecting data to evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness for these age groups.\\xc2\\xa0.\nIn July, the FDA expanded vaccine trials for children under 12 \""to more closely examine rare but serious instances, particularly in young boys, in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed,\"" or myocarditis, the Washington Post reported . It said this has pushed the timetable to early 2022.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThere have been more than 1,000 reports of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, a similar condition where the lining of the outside of the heart becomes inflamed, after some COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States, according to the CDC.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""Considering the hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered, these reports are very rare,\"" reported Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in a fact sheet about the vaccines for parents . \""The problem occurs more often in adolescents [teens] and young adults, and in males. The myocarditis or pericarditis in almost all cases is mild and resolves quickly.\"".\nOn its website, the CDC says side effects in adolescents, including possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis , \""are rare and the known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks.\"".\n\""COVID-19 vaccines have been used under the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, which includes studies in adolescents,\"" the CDC website adds.\\xc2\\xa0.\nDr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told NPR last month that Pfizer and Moderna \""are still collecting trial data, trying to understand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 among other things \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whether young children should receive a smaller vaccine dose than what has already been approved for adults.\"".\nThat indicates work is ongoing to ensure the right dose of the vaccine is authorized for young children. Elder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that the science suggests young people shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receive the vaccine is not supported.\\xc2\\xa0.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIn May, the FDA approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis. The vaccine had been available for everyone age 16 and older in the United States since April.\\xc2\\xa0.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top infectious-disease expert, recently said that a vaccine could be available to young children \""hopefully by the mid, late fall and early winter.\""\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe World Health Organization is one leading group that says children should not be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccinations. But as PolitiFact reported in June , that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not because the WHO takes issue with its safety or effectiveness.\\xc2\\xa0.\nInstead, the WHO believes health care workers, front-line workers, the elderly and those with high-risk medical conditions should be at the front of the line because children develop less severe cases than adults and vaccine supplies are limited in many countries.\nWe also examined Elder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that young people shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to wear masks because the science isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \""settled\"" on that. Again, we found the science is more certain than Elder makes it out to be.\\xc2\\xa0.\nLeading scientific organizations, including the CDC and AAP , recommend students wear masks at schools, saying they reduce the spread of COVID-19.\\xc2\\xa0.\nOn its website, the CDC recommends \""universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.\""\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""Although outbreaks in schools can occur, multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or at least similar to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 levels of community transmission, when prevention strategies are in place in schools,\"" the CDC reported in July , adding that inconsistent mask use can contribute to outbreaks.\nSince the start of the pandemic, PolitiFact has examined the science behind using masks to slow transmission and debunked myths about them. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s found masks are most effective as \""source control,\"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people.\\xc2\\xa0.\nNow that students are back on campus in California and across the country, health officials say vaccines and universal mask requirements will be key to keeping in-person learning safe and open.\n\""Masking is likely the second most important thing [behind vaccinations] to prevent transmission and allow children to go to schools and have in-person learning safely,\"" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hospital in Sacramento.\nBlumberg added that wearing a standard surgical mask or double layer fabric mask reduces a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chance of infection by about 70%.\n\""If you want to avoid having that outbreak that\\'s going to send all the kids home again, you should be doing everything to avoid that. And that means wearing masks,\"" Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, added in the NPR interview .\nIn July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administration issued guidance calling for universal masking at K-12 public schools statewide. Newsom later said it would allow local school districts to decide how to deal with students who refuse to wear a mask, sparking confusion about whether the guidance is a requirement.\\xc2\\xa0.\nLarry Elder, the top-polling GOP candidate in the California recall election, claimed the science doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suggest young people should receive the COVID-19 vaccine or wear masks in schools.\nWe found the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Federal Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend young people, ages 12 and up, receive the COVID-19 vaccine to protect their health and slow the pandemic.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe vaccine has not yet been authorized for children under 12 because more data collection is needed, though health officials expect it will be approved this fall or winter.\nElder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall statement would have been more accurate had he said the science on the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 12 is incomplete.

The emails were obtained by\u00a0BuzzFeed\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0through a Freedom of Information Act request and made public in separate reports published on June 1.\nHydroxychloroquine is specifically mentioned nearly three-dozen times, usually in the form of someone asking the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director for his thoughts on the drug, which is typically used to treat lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and malaria.\nThe earliest mention was from an exchange Fauci had on Feb. 24, 2020, with a pharmacologist at the federal Food and Drug Administration asking him if there was any proof to back up a claim from China on hydroxychloroquine being able to \""decrease COVID-19 infections and lung disease.\"".\n\""There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim.

Fred Upton, R-Mich., asked whether there were any cases of lupus patients contracting COVID-19.\n\""The answer is almost certainly yes, but there would not be enough of them whereby we can compare the results in those who were receiving hydroxychloroquine or not for their lupus,\"" Fauci responded. \""Large natural history studies, which we will be initiating, could possibly answer that question.\"".\nIn other emails asking about the drug, Fauci did acknowledge there were anecdotal accounts about hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness but said he was waiting on results from a then-ongoing clinical trial conducted by the\u00a0National Institutes of Health\u00a0looking into whether the drug could be used as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\""We will know soon whether hydroxychloroquine has any beneficial effects as the results of randomized, controlled trials become available,\"" he said in one email sent May 1, 2020.\nAt no point in any of the emails sent by Fauci did he say himself that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment. However, around the time of the emails, then-President Donald Trump was\u00a0touting its alleged benefits.\nFauci\u2019s emails echo past statements he\u2019s\u00a0made publicly\u00a0about the drug, acknowledging the anecdotal evidence but withholding any official position until a clinical trial is completed.\nThe study conducted by the NIH was eventually\u00a0halted in June 2020\u00a0after it found hydroxychloroquine was \""very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\"".\n\""The data from this study indicate that this drug provided no additional benefit compared to placebo control for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,\"" according to a statement from the NIH.\nAt the same time, the FDA revoked the\u00a0emergency use authorization\u00a0it had issued for the drug\u00a0three months prior. In addition to the NIH study finding no benefit to taking hydroxychloroquine, the FDA said taking the drug could potentially lead to serious side effects including \""serious cardiac adverse events\"" and that any potential benefits \""no longer outweigh the known and potential risks.\"".\nMisinformation attempting to connect Fauci and his knowledge about hydroxychloroquine is not new.

According to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool, posts mentioning Fauci and hydroxychloroquine have racked up tens of thousands of interactions in the days after the emails were made public.\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and\u00a0President Joe Biden\\'s chief medical adviser, did send and receive emails about hydroxychloroquine in spring 2020. But he didn\\'t \""lie\"" about its effectiveness in treating COVID-19.\nHydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, is not a proven treatment for COVID-19, public health officials say. Early in the pandemic, Fauci expressed interest in the drug, but he maintained that more data was needed to prove its efficacy. Fauci\\'s emailed comments on hydroxychloroquine line up with what he said in public and the scientific consensus about the drug.\nThe earliest mention of hydroxychloroquine in the cache of emails dates to Feb. 24, 2020, when Fauci responded to an inquiry about using the drug to treat COVID-19.\n\""Is there any indication/data to substantiate this claim from China (attached publication) that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can decrease COVID-19 infections and lung disease?\"" wrote Philip Gatti, a pharmacologist for the Food and Drug Administration.\nFauci replied: \""There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim. There are a lot of these types of claims going around. I would love to see their data.\"".\nIt\\'s a line that Fauci repeated often over the next several weeks, both in public and in private : Claims that hydroxychloroquine could treat COVID-19 were based on anecdotal evidence.\nEarly hope for hydroxychloroquine was based primarily on two small trials that suggested the drug helped patients recover from COVID-19. But other studies offered conflicting results, and randomized controlled trials \u2013 the gold standard for measuring the effectiveness of a drug or treatment \u2013\u00a0had not yet been done.\n\""We will know soon whether hydroxychloroquine has any beneficial effects as the results of randomized, controlled trials become available,\"" Fauci wrote in a May 1, 2020, email.\nIn a press release published two weeks later, as President Donald Trump continued to tout hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, Fauci tempered expectations for the drug ahead of a clinical trial from the\u00a0National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\""Although there is anecdotal evidence\u00a0that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes,\"" he said in the press release , which he approved in an email April 23, 2020.\nThe NIH halted the clinical trial in June 2020 after data indicated\u00a0hydroxychloroquine \""provided no additional benefit compared to placebo control for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.\"" The FDA revoked its emergency use authorization for the drug around the same time, saying \""the known and potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use.\"".\n\u201cThe finding that hydroxychloroquine is not effective for the treatment of COVID-19 was consistent across patient subgroups and for all evaluated outcomes, including clinical status, mortality, organ failures, duration of oxygen use and hospital length of stay,\u201d Dr. Wesley Self , trial lead and associate professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said in a press release .\nIn early July, the FDA issued a summary of safety questions associated with using hydroxychloroquine to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Among them: blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries and liver problems.\n\""Using hydroxychloroquine for prevention had little or no effect on preventing illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19,\"" the agency says on its website .\u00a0\""Taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 may increase the risk of diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, drowsiness and headache.\"" Our rating: False.\nThe claim that emails show Fauci \""lied\"" about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 is FALSE, based on our research. Fauci\\'s emails line up with what he said in public about hydroxychloroquine and the scientific consensus about the drug \u2013 that more data was needed. When later studies provided that data, it became clear hydroxychloroquine does not effectively treat COVID-19. Public health officials warn against its use in treating the disease.

The emails were obtained by BuzzFeed and the Washington Post through a Freedom of Information Act request and made public in separate reports published on June 1.\nHydroxychloroquine is specifically mentioned nearly three-dozen times, usually in the form of someone asking the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director for his thoughts on the drug, which is typically used to treat lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and malaria.\nThe earliest mention was from an exchange Fauci had on Feb. 24, 2020, with a pharmacologist at the federal Food and Drug Administration asking him if there was any proof to back up a claim from China on hydroxychloroquine being able to \""decrease COVID-19 infections and lung disease.\"".\n\""There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim. There are a lot of these types of claims going around. I would love to see their data,\"" Fauci responded.\nThe next mention of hydroxychloroquine in the email dump occurred April 11, 2020, when Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., asked whether there were any cases of lupus patients contracting COVID-19.\n\""The answer is almost certainly yes, but there would not be enough of them whereby we can compare the results in those who were receiving hydroxychloroquine or not for their lupus,\"" Fauci responded. \""Large natural history studies, which we will be initiating, could possibly answer that question.\"".\nIn other emails asking about the drug, Fauci did acknowledge there were anecdotal accounts about hydroxychloroquine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effectiveness but said he was waiting on results from a then-ongoing clinical trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health looking into whether the drug could be used as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\""We will know soon whether hydroxychloroquine has any beneficial effects as the results of randomized, controlled trials become available,\"" he said in one email sent May 1, 2020.\nAt no point in any of the emails sent by Fauci did he say himself that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment. However, around the time of the emails, then-President Donald Trump was touting its alleged benefits .\nFauci\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails echo past statements he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made publicly about the drug, acknowledging the anecdotal evidence but withholding any official position until a clinical trial is completed.\nThe study conducted by the NIH was eventually halted in June 2020 after it found hydroxychloroquine was \""very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\"".\n\""The data from this study indicate that this drug provided no additional benefit compared to placebo control for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,\"" according to a statement from the NIH.\nAt the same time, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization it had issued for the drug\\xc2\\xa0 three months prior. In addition to the NIH study finding no benefit to taking hydroxychloroquine, the FDA said taking the drug could potentially lead to serious side effects including \""serious cardiac adverse events\"" and that any potential benefits \""no longer outweigh the known and potential risks.\"".\nMisinformation attempting to connect Fauci and his knowledge about hydroxychloroquine is not new. PolitiFact previously debunked a claim in 2020 alleging he knew as early as 2005 the drug was capable of treating coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19 and actively advocated against its use.\nA Facebook post claims Fauci knew about hydroxychloroquine\\'s ability to treat people with COVID-19, referencing emails from the health director obtained by BuzzFeed and the Washington Post.\\xc2\\xa0.\nHowever, those emails do not show him acknowledging its effectiveness.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\\xc2\\xa0.\nThis post has a couple of factual inaccuracies. It jumps to the wrong conclusion about \""ordinary\"" masks and COVID-19. The role of masks in preventing smoke inhalation is different than the role masks play in preventing the spread of disease.\nWildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, affect the immune system, and make people more prone to lung infections, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe CDC says the greatest protection against wildfire smoke is to reduce exposure by limiting time outdoors and seeking cleaner air spaces or shelters. Cloth masks are not effective for filtering wildfire smoke.\n\""Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke,\"" the health agency says on its website . \""They do not catch small, harmful particles in smoke that can harm your health. Although N95 respirators do provide protection from wildfire smoke, they might be in short supply as frontline healthcare workers use them during the pandemic.\"".\nWhen it comes to COVID-19, the CDC recommends people wear cloth masks as a form of source control \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if the wearer coughs, sneezes, laughs or talks, the mask blocks their respiratory droplets from spreading to others.

If you have an irregular heartbeat or heart palpitations, but an EKG didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t detect anything, a cardiac monitor can help diagnose the problem. You wear the Holter monitor while you do your daily activities. Your provider discusses the results with you. .\nA Holter monitor is a wearable device and type of ambulatory electrocardiogram that records your heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rhythm and rate activity. It gives your provider a full picture of what your heart rhythm and rate does as you go about your life. .\nA Holter monitor records your heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s electrical activity for 24 or 48 hours. While you wear it, you continue to do your regular daily activities. The Holter monitor is named for Dr. Norman J. Holter, who created it in the 1950s. Does wearing a Holter monitor hurt? .\nYou may need a Holter monitor if you have an inconclusive electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a type of heart test. An inconclusive EKG means it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provide clear results. .\nMaybe you saw your doctor because of signs of a heart rhythm problem \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like your heart is racing or fluttering. Or you had unexplained fainting. .\nYour provider decided to do an EKG to find the problem. But the EKG only records your heart for a short period. Heart symptoms don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always happen while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. .\nIf the EKG doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell your provider what they need to know, a Holter monitor can help. It gathers more information about your heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activity. You wear it for a full day or two, giving it more chances to spot unusual activity.

What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the difference between an EKG and a Holter monitor? .\nAn EKG measures your heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activity at that moment in time, as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having the test. But your heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rhythm and symptoms can change over the day. .\nYour provider may want to see how your heartbeat changes during the day as you do your regular activities. The heart monitor gives your provider a fuller picture of your heart rhythm. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the difference between Holter and event monitoring? .\nA Holter monitor records your heart continuously for 24 or 48 hours. An event monitor is not continuous. It only records your heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activity when you feel symptoms and activate the monitor. .\nYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to do anything special to prepare for a Holter monitor. The technician may need to shave your chest where they attach the electrodes. What should I expect when wearing the Holter monitor? .\nA technician connects you to the heart monitor and provides instructions.

The tape might cause some itchiness or irritation. Let your provider know if you have any allergies to tapes or adhesives. .\nYour provider will call you with the results within a week or two after the test. The results may show that the heart monitor detected a heart rhythm disorder (arrhythmia), such as: Atrial fibrillation Bradycardia Tachycardia Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) .\nYour provider will discuss the next steps with you. You may need heart rhythm medications or further testing. What should I ask my provider about the Holter monitor? .\nA Holter monitor provides a picture of your heart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activity over 24 or 48 hours. It can help your provider diagnose the cause of a heart issue that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show up on an EKG. You wear the Holter monitor while you go about your regular activities.

The patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history of anxiety and pre-existing conditions was assessed and deemed to represent little perioperative risk. The patient was given medications for anxiety and opioids for pain. The patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s initial postoperative assessment was normal. Yet, when a nurse entered the room at a regularly scheduled time to perform a vital signs assessment, the patient was found deceased. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was really the case that led us to say that this should never happen to a patient at Dartmouth-Hitchcock ever again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McGrath said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe act of intermittent, manual vital sign collection is just not at a frequency or detail that provides clinicians with the ability to really detect patient deterioration in a timely manner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nWith manual patient monitoring, clinicians are likely to miss significant changes in oxygen saturation, pulse rate, respiration rate, total hemoglobin and other clinical measurements. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s indeed a lot of information that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not seen when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking only at intermittent vital signs manually,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McGrath said. Continuous Monitoring Makes a Difference .\nTo address this issue, the healthcare center implemented an electronic surveillance patient monitoring system in its general care settings about 15 years ago and has continued to expand the use of automated systems in other areas since then. This helps aggregate data from bedside monitors and deliver the information directly to clinicians via their phones, pagers or computers so they can provide needed interventions. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe believe that continuous monitoring of all patients in all settings is really something that is important in order to prevent deterioration from going too far and to bring resources to the bedside in an efficient way that brings treatment to patients,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McGrath said. .\nThe healthcare center now aims to improve its ability to both detect and respond to patients in decline in a variety of care settings, as it leverages continuous monitoring to address numerous challenges, such as delays in information delivery; loss of information; and limited understanding of risks, warning signs and possible outcomes. Perhaps most importantly, the hospital is using automated systems to help clinicians deal with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnoise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d associated with all the unnecessary information they are typically bombarded with when caring for patients. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith all of the blinking lights and alarms, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often very difficult for clinicians to understand what is important and what is needed... and how to best care for that patient,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jennifer Jackson, director of connectivity for Masimo, which produces the monitoring technology. .\nAutomated alerting, however, has enabled clinicians to take the actions that effectively meet the needs of patients in decline. In fact, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe recently published a study that looked back over the 10 years after implementation and shows that in monitored patients we had not a single death... from opioid-induced respiratory depression,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McGrath noted. .\nA more recent patient reveals how monitoring now benefits patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 health at the hospital. A man in his 60s was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple injuries after a car accident. The automated surveillance system continuously monitored his health status via data from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry devices as well as periodic vitals charting from the EHR. After being in the ICU for three days, the patient was transferred to the general care unit. The electronic patient monitoring continued, and the rescue team was called when pulse oximetry alarms sounded. As a result, the patient was transferred back to the ICU to manage ventilation and his stay was extended an additional five days. Keeping Tabs on Home-Based Patients .\nWhile Dartmouth-Hitchcock\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience illustrates why it is important to electronically monitor patients in all inpatient areas, when the pandemic took hold, leaders at Renown Health recognized how crucial it is to automatically check on those receiving care outside of the hospital\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four walls , as well. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe pandemic pushed the boundaries for parity when it comes to telemedicine. How long will it be before the entire healthcare system repositions itself to provide hospital-level care for patients at home through ongoing remote monitoring,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Tony Slonim, MD, DrPH, president and chief executive officer for Renown Health. .\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the needs of this community\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patients and families brought many issues surrounding home care to the forefront of the healthcare system\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach to population health. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow great would it be for people to not have to drive four hours because we can put wearable, continuous pulse oximetry literally at their fingertips, and measure oxygen saturation, pulse rate and respiration from 200 miles away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Dr. Slonim asked.\\xc2\\xa0 .\nThey utilized a pulse oximeter monitor to actively prompt patients to answer questions such as, are you having trouble breathing? Or what is your temperature? These responses, along with other data, are pushed to clinicians at Renown Health for evaluation. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is now compelling evidence that well-monitored, at-home treatment can be safer, cheaper and more effective than traditional hospital stays, especially for patients who are elderly, frail and vulnerable to complications,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Renown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s director of telehealth, Mitchell Fong. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur patients have the most sophisticated and reliable respiratory monitoring available anywhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fong said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know that continuous physiologic monitoring with Patient Safety Net improves outcomes and saves lives. The ability to extend that capability to patients in nontraditional settings and at home during this crisis is transformative.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIn addition, to effectively act on all alerts, this healthcare system partnered with its local emergency medical services (EMS) agency. When hospital staff receive an alert and need additional resources to reach the patient or the emergency contact, the EMS unit will conduct a wellness check. This extra step ensures that patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 needs are met. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about making sure that you have clear escalation pathways, that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coordination and resources available to take timely and appropriate action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fong said. .\nTo accommodate this surge in patient volume due to COVID-19 cases, the hospital converted an adjacent parking garage into a fully equipped alternative care site-field hospital. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis type of technology, is a game-changer in improving patient care,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said chief medical officer of acute services, Paul Sierzenski, MD. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGiven the demand on our hospitals during this COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased to provide appropriate patients with this telehealth solution, which uses wearable pulse oximetry, allowing us to help manage the surge in COVID-19 patients, and allowing patients the convenience of their own homes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nPatients also reported high satisfaction levels with the care they received while on the remote patient monitoring system; 91% of those surveyed indicated that they would recommend Renown. Addressing Challenges with Maturing Systems .\nThe experiences at Dartmouth-Hitchcock and Renown illustrate the importance of leveraging automated monitoring systems across the care continuum. Without such electronic surveillance, healthcare providers are likely to struggle to meet patient needs because: .\nFortunately, as electronic patient monitoring systems have evolved over the past 30 years, healthcare providers have been able to address these issues. In fact, these electronic systems now not only monitor oxygen levels, but also capnography, ventilator status, patient positioning and more in a variety of environments, including the operating room, ICU, neonatal ICU and other settings. .\nMost importantly, though, clinicians receive \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontextualized information such as the location of the patient, the severity of the alarm and even the physiological values associated with that alarm, which enables them to take immediate action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Masimo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s senior vice president of software engineering, Omar Ahmed. .\nBut the work is not done, as technology continues to advance. To further bolster effectiveness, it will also take fine tuning the alerts themselves. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are constantly looking at how to improve this notion of bringing the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s condition to the clinician. So again, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just an instantaneous alert about a heart rate. Instead, we want to provide the clinician with information about what does that mean and what actions need to be taken to address the situation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jackson concluded. .\nThe views and opinions expressed in this content or by commenters are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of HIMSS or its affiliates. .\nAt HIMSS, our vision is to realize the full health potential of every human, everywhere.

A man flummoxed by an intake form in a doctor\u2019s office reflexively writes \u201cno\u201d to every question because he doesn\u2019t understand what is being asked.

And a man in his 70s preparing for his first colonoscopy uses a suppository as directed, but without first removing it from the foil packet.\nEach of these examples provided by health-care workers or patient advocates illustrates one of the most pervasive and under-recognized problems in medicine: Americans\u2019 alarmingly low levels of health literacy\\xc2\\xa0\u2013 the ability to obtain, understand and use health information.\nA 2006 study by the U.S. Department of Education found that 36 percent of adults have only basic or below-basic skills for dealing with health material. This means that 90 million Americans can understand discharge instructions written only at a fifth-grade level or lower. About 52 percent had intermediate skills: They could figure out what time a medication should be taken if the label says \u201ctake two hours after eating,\u201d while the remaining 12 percent were deemed proficient because they could search a complex document and find the information necessary to define a medical term.\nRegardless of their literacy skills, patients are expected to manage multiple chronic diseases, to comply with drug regimens \\xc2\\xa0that have grown increasingly complicated and to operate sophisticated medical devices such as at-home chemotherapy equipment largely on their own.\nHealth literacy \u201caffects every single thing we do,\u201d said Susan Pisano, a member of the Institute of Medicine\u2019s health literacy roundtable and vice president of communications for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade association. \u201cThe implications are mind-boggling.\u201d.\nAs recently as a decade ago, the problem of health literacy was largely the province of academic researchers who published study after study documenting the glaring mismatch between the dense, technical and jargon-heavy materials routinely given to patients, some written at the graduate school level, and their ability to understand them.\nThese days, health literacy is the focus of unprecedented attention from government officials, hospitals and insurers who regard it as inextricably linked to implementing the health-care overhaul law and controlling medical costs. The new law, which contains explicit references to health literacy, requires that information about medications and providers be made accessible to those with limited skills. In October, President Barack Obama signed the Plain Writing Act , which will boost that effort by directing federal agencies to use plain language in their materials.\nAdding urgency to those endeavors is the projected influx into the health care system of 32 million currently uninsured Americans who will begin to get coverage in 2014 under the new law.\n\u201cHealth literacy is needed to make health reform a reality,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said last year as she launched the National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy , an effort designed to eliminate medical jargon and the complex, often convoluted explanations that pervade handouts, forms and Web sites.\n\u201cA whole bunch of new people are going to be entering the health-care market and making decisions that involve not just cost and \u2018Is my doctor in the plan?\\'\u201d but also complicated trade-offs about risks and benefits, said Cindy Brach, a senior policy analyst at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which has made improving health literacy a priority .\nStudies have linked poor health literacy, which disproportionately affects the elderly, the poor and recent immigrants, to higher rates of hospital readmission, expensive and unnecessary complications, and even death. A 2007 study estimated the problem cost the U.S. economy as much as $238 billion annually.\nStarting this year, the Joint Commission, the group that accredits hospitals, is requiring them to use plain-language materials and to \u201ccommunicate in a manner that meets the patient\u2019s oral and written communication needs\u201d in providing care.\nHospitals and health plans increasingly are turning to computer software that analyzes materials given to patients and flags overly technical language such as \u201cmyocardial infarction\u201d (heart attack), \u201chyperlipidemia\u201d (high cholesterol) and \u201cfebrile\u201d (feverish). One program, developed by Bethesda-based Health Literacy Innovations, is being used by the National Institutes of Health, CVS and Howard University Hospital. It analyzes texts for complexity and suggests ways to simplify them.\nEmployers are pushing insurers to demonstrate that the materials they give patients are simple and intelligible, said Aileen Kantor, founder of Health Literary Innovations.\nDoctors at Boston Medical Center have pioneered an innovative program called Project RED, short for Re-Engineered Discharge, an effort that between 2006 and 2007 reduced readmission rates for the first month after discharge by 30 percent and costs by 33 percent. Instead of standard instructions, RED patients received a personalized discharge booklet, along with help making follow-up appointments and a call from a pharmacist a few days after they arrived home.\nJaved Butler, a heart surgeon at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, said one obstacle to improving health literacy is the language that doctors typically use. \u201cWhen we say \u2018diet,\u2019 we mean \u2018food,\u2019 but patients think we mean going on a diet. And when we say \u2018exercise,\u2019 we may mean \u2018walking,\u2019 but patients think we mean \u2018going to the gym.\u2019 At every step there\u2019s a potential for misunderstanding,\u201d said Butler, who added that he tries not to lapse into \u201cmedicalese\u201d with patients.\nIt\u2019s not a problem only for those with basic skills. Paula Robinson, a patient education manager at the Lehigh Valley Health Network, which includes three hospitals in eastern Pennsylvania, said that even highly educated patients are affected, particularly if they\u2019re stressed or sick.\nShe cites the initial reaction of former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who thought he was cancer-free when his doctor told him several years ago that his prostate biopsy was \u201cpositive.\u201d Actually, a positive biopsy indicates the presence of cancer.\nMany patients, Robinson said, won\u2019t ask questions or say they don\u2019t understand, either because they are intimidated or worried about looking stupid. Some simply tune out or shut down, she said, and \u201ca lot of people take things literally because of anxiety.\u201d.\nRobinson recounts one such case: A patient who had been prescribed daily insulin shots to control his diabetes diligently practiced injecting the drug into an orange while in the hospital. It was only after he was readmitted with dangerously high blood sugar readings that doctors discovered he was injecting the insulin into an orange, then eating it.\nAHRQ\u2019s Brach said that some time-strapped doctors have complained that their schedules are too packed to add literacy concerns to the list.\nBut she said simple measures that are not unduly time-consuming can be integrated into the visit. They include a method called \u201cteach back,\u201d which asks patients to repeat in their own words what they have just been told.\nIllinois geriatrician Cheryl Woodson said she avoids making assumptions about her patients\u2019 health literacy. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell by looking,\u201d said Woodson, a solo practitioner in Chicago Heights.\n\u201cI never ask, \u2018Do you understand?\\'\u201d she added, \u201cbecause they say, \u2018Uh-huh,\u2019 and you don\u2019t know what they understand. So instead I\u2019ll say, \u2018I know your daughter is going to want to know about this, so what are you going to tell her?\\'\u201d.\nSometimes the problem is not health literacy, but the ability to read or write at all. It is estimated that 14 percent of adults are illiterate, but many find ingenious ways of compensating and take great pains to hide the problem.\nArchie Willard said he avoided going to the doctor for years before he learned to read at age 54.

Boodman.\nAn elderly woman sent home from the hospital develops a life-threatening infection because she doesn\u2019t understand the warning signs listed in the discharge instructions. A man flummoxed by an intake form in a doctor\u2019s office reflexively writes \u201cno\u201d to every question because he doesn\u2019t understand what is being asked. A young mother pours a drug that is supposed to be taken by mouth into her baby\u2019s ear, perforating the eardrum. And a man in his 70s preparing for his first colonoscopy uses a suppository as directed, but without first removing it from the foil packet.\nEach of these examples provided by health-care workers or patient advocates illustrates one of the most pervasive and under-recognized problems in medicine: Americans\u2019 alarmingly low levels of health literacy\\xc2\\xa0\u2013 the ability to obtain, understand and use health information. Translating Medical Jargon.\nA 2006 study by the U.S. Department of Education found that 36 percent of adults have only basic or below-basic skills for dealing with health material. This means that 90 million Americans can understand discharge instructions written only at a fifth-grade level or lower. About 52 percent had intermediate skills: They could figure out what time a medication should be taken if the label says \u201ctake two hours after eating,\u201d while the remaining 12 percent were deemed proficient because they could search a complex document and find the information necessary to define a medical term.\nRegardless of their literacy skills, patients are expected to manage multiple chronic diseases, to comply with drug regimens \\xc2\\xa0that have grown increasingly complicated and to operate sophisticated medical devices such as at-home chemotherapy equipment largely on their own.\nHealth literacy \u201caffects every single thing we do,\u201d said Susan Pisano, a member of the Institute of Medicine\u2019s health literacy roundtable and vice president of communications for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade association. \u201cThe implications are mind-boggling.\u201d.\nAs recently as a decade ago, the problem of health literacy was largely the province of academic researchers who published study after study documenting the glaring mismatch between the dense, technical and jargon-heavy materials routinely given to patients, some written at the graduate school level, and their ability to understand them.\nThese days, health literacy is the focus of unprecedented attention from government officials, hospitals and insurers who regard it as inextricably linked to implementing the health-care overhaul law and controlling medical costs. The new law, which contains explicit references to health literacy, requires that information about medications and providers be made accessible to those with limited skills. In October, President Barack Obama signed the Plain Writing Act , which will boost that effort by directing federal agencies to use plain language in their materials.\nAdding urgency to those endeavors is the projected influx into the health care system of 32 million currently uninsured Americans who will begin to get coverage in 2014 under the new law.

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to get hurt by it.\"".\nTo be clear, the Food and Drug Administration cautions that hydroxychloroquine can hurt people. It increases the risk of an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to cardiac arrest.\\xc2\\xa0.\nTrump didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention that. He did, however, dismiss the research that cast doubt on whether the drug does any good against COVID-19.\n\""If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\"" Trump said at a May 19 press event. \""They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.\"".\nTrump spoke as if there were only one negative study. There have been three: the one on VA patients and two larger ones. They all reached the same conclusion that outcomes with hydroxychloroquine were the same as without it.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe earliest work on hydroxychloroquine was small studies, sometimes with as few as 30 patients, and for each study that showed promise, another study found no benefit. The mixed results spurred more research.\nThe analysis Trump criticized came in late April, when researchers at the universities of South Carolina and Virginia released their paper on 368 VA patients with COVID-19. They looked at who got hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or both, and they tracked who ended up on a ventilator or died. The paper was released without peer review.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThey found that hydroxychloroquine, with or without the other drug, had no effect on whether someone had to be put on a ventilator. Worse, hydroxychloroquine increased the chances of dying.\nThe authors cautioned that all of the patients involved in the study, regardless of outcome, were men over 65. And they also factored in a range of underlying conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and other health risks. Those issues were found in roughly equal numbers across all groups of patients. Ultimately, about 75% of the patients getting hydroxychloroquine lived. The survival rate was close to 90% for those who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it.\nIn early May, two studies emerged based on patients treated in the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest COVID-19 hotspot, New York City. Both investigations were much larger than the study of VA patients.\nThe study that appeared May 7 in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the medical records of 1,376 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. Their results echoed the first study on hydroxychloroquine.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n\""There was no association between administration of the drug and a lower chance of dying or winding up on a respirator,\"" said co-author Neil Schluger, the head of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\nNow, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fair to say that the patients who got the drug were, as a group, a bit worse off than those who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. In particular, their blood oxygen levels were lower when they were first admitted. Schluger said that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter.\nOn May 11, the JAMA Network of the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study of 1,438 randomly selected COVID-19 patients treated at 25 New York area hospitals. That group of researchers tracked whether they died in the hospital. They, too, found no connection between outcomes and use of hydroxychloroquine. They also found no impact from the use of another drug, azithromycin. About 75% of patients getting hydroxychloroquine survived, compared with about 87% who were not given the drug.\nLike the other study, this one found that patients who got the drug were in worse health at admission than those who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They might have lower oxygen levels, or some other condition such as diabetes or obesity.\\xc2\\xa0.\nBut by examining patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 full medical records, both teams were able to use stronger analytic tools to filter out the impact of differences in underlying health. Once that was done, they could make apples-to-apples comparisons of the effect of hydroxychloroquine on people who got the drug and those who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\nThe authors of all studies acknowledged that working with patient records after the fact isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the final answer, and they called for more research.\nTrump spoke about \""the one survey,\"" a study of VA patients and hydroxychloroquine, and said it was \""bad\"" because \""they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old. Almost dead.\"".\nAs a group, the patients getting the drug were not on the verge of death. Across three studies, about 75% to 80% of the patients receiving the drug survived.\\xc2\\xa0.\nTo say they were in very bad shape is also off the mark. Health issues were found in members of both the treatment and non-treatment groups. That allowed researchers to tease out the impact, and make informed comparisons that took these health differences into account.\nJAMA Network, Association of Treatment With Hydroxychloroquine or Azithromycin With In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 in New York State , May 11, 2020.\n Kari Lake has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgone on the record saying she supports Arizona\\'s complete abortion ban.

The number\\xc2\\xa0of users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 data the firm reportedly gained access to (50 million) is much higher because it includes the users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 friends. The number of user data, it follows, was much higher for the Obama campaign, too.\n The 2020 election could not have been fair because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLos Angeles County agreed, during litigation, that there were 1.2 million ineligible voters after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe Obama campaign created a Facebook app for supporters to donate, learn of voting requirements, and find nearby houses to canvass. The app asked users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 permission to scan their photos, friends lists, and news feeds. Most users complied.\nThe people signing up knew the data they were handing over would be used to support a political campaign. Their friends, however, did not.\nThe people who downloaded the app used by Cambridge Analytica did not know their data would be used to aid any political campaigns. The app was billed as a personality quiz that would be used by Cambridge University researchers.\nAleksandr Kogan, one of the Cambridge researchers involved in the project, sold the data to the upstart political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company then sold its services not only to the Trump campaign, but to the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz and the senatorial campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., among others.\nWhen Facebook discovered a developer had shared users\\xe2\\x80\\x99 data without their consent in 2015, it asked both the original app and the consultancy to delete the data. That didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen.\n\""The thing that is true is that every Facebook app you downloaded back then was getting access to your entire friends list,\"" said David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. \""When tech people were trying to raise outrage about it they were being ignored. Now, everyone is outraged. But what (McCain) is wrong about this is that Kogan then sold it, and for a much creepier purpose.\"".\nObama operatives used Facebook data to get users to send their messaging for them, according to Eitan Hersh, a Tufts professor who wrote Hacking the Electorate, a book on Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s microtargeting strategies.\nFacebook friends lists, tags and photos allowed Obama operatives to identify a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close friends, which they then matched with offline public records. (Was this person likely to vote for Obama, but unlikely to get out to vote?) They then told the app users which of their friends they should send campaign messages to.\nCambridge Analytica dialed up what Karpf called the creepiness factor. They combined the survey results with the Facebook data to create psychological profiles they then sold to campaigns. The idea was, if the firm could\\xc2\\xa0discover how these people thought, they could target ads toward them.\nCambridge Analytica then sent targeted ads to the users on their database as well as users with similar profiles, identified by Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lookalike tool.\\xc2\\xa0The friends of the app users weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t being targeted by their friends, but by the campaign itself. In other words, the consenting middle man was gone.\nThe Obama campaign and Cambridge Analytica both gained access to huge amounts of information about Facebook users and their friends, and in neither case did the friends of app users consent.\nBut in Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign. In the Cambridge Analytica case, users only knew were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes.\nThe Obama campaign used the data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends. Cambridge Analytica targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads.\nWhereas the data gathering and the uses were very different, the data each campaign gained access to was similar.

Both of them said the reason why there are seven Republican booths and five Democratic booths at the Mansfield Subcourthouse is not because of the census, as Joe Williams originally stated. Instead, this discrepancy is based on voter history at that polling location. Buen said that the Tarrant County Elections Administration Department decides how many of each booth there are going to be. .\nBuen said that the Democratic precinct chairs voted to keep the voting booths separate because they were concerned that their voters might be subjected to potentially hostile election judges. .\nTarrant County Elections tweeted out that they offered to have the parties share equipment this year, but the parties did not agree to do so.

The new alternatives, tailored to a diverse work force struggling amid a pandemic in Texas \\xe2\\x80\\x99 largest county, helped increase turnout by nearly 10 percent compared with 2016; nearly 70 percent of registered voters cast ballots, and a task force found that there was no evidence of any fraud .\nA voter in a car used a drive-through voting station at NRG Arena in Houston to cast a ballot in the presidential election. Credit... Go Nakamura for The New York Times.\nYet Republicans are pushing measures through the State Legislature that would take aim at the very process that produced such a large turnout. Two omnibus bills, including one that the House is likely to take up in the coming week, are seeking to roll back virtually every expansion the county put in place for 2020.\nThe bills would make Texas one of the hardest states in the country to cast a ballot in. And they are a prime example of a Republican-led effort to roll back voting access in Democrat-rich cities and populous regions like Atlanta and Arizona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Maricopa County, while having far less of an impact on voting in rural areas that tend to lean Republican .\nBills in several states are, in effect, creating a two-pronged approach to urban and rural areas that raises questions about the disparate treatment of cities and the large number of voters of color who live in them. That divide is helping to fuel opposition from corporations that are based in or have work forces in those places.\nIn Texas, Republicans have taken the rare tack of outlining restrictions that would apply only to counties with population of more than one million, targeting the booming and increasingly diverse metropolitan areas of Houston, Austin, San Antonio and Dallas.\nThe Republican focus on diverse urban areas, voting activists say, evokes the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history of racially discriminatory voting laws \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including poll taxes and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhite primary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d laws during the Jim Crow era \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that essentially excluded Black voters from the electoral process.\nPolitics Across the United States Expanding Medicaid: North Carolina became the 40th state to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act , the latest sign of how Republican opposition to the health measure has weakened.

But the majority of those who used drive-through or 24-hour voting \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the early voting methods the Republican bills would prohibit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 were people of color, the group found.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear they are trying to make it harder for people to vote who face everyday circumstances, especially things like poverty and other situations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Chris Hollins, a Democrat and the former interim clerk of Harris County, who oversaw and implemented many of the policies during the November election. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith 24-hour voting, there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even claims or a legal challenge during the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe effort to further restrict voting in Texas is taking place against the backdrop of an increasingly tense showdown between legislators and Texas-based corporations, with Republicans in the House proposing financial retribution for companies that have spoken out.\nAmerican Airlines and Dell Technologies both voiced strong opposition to the bill, and AT&T issued a statement supporting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoting laws that make it easier for more Americans to vote,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d though it did not specifically mention Texas.\nAmerican Airlines also dispatched Jack McCain, the son of former Senator John McCain, to lobby Republicans in Austin to roll back some of the more stringent restrictions.\nRepublicans in the State Legislature appear unbowed. In amendments filed to the state budget this week, House Republicans proposed that \\xe2\\x80\\x9can entity that publicly threatened any adverse reaction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d related to \\xe2\\x80\\x9celection integrity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would not be eligible for some state funds.\nWhile those amendments did not end up in the final budget, a broader proposal threatening corporations that speak out on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany legislative or executive action\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was added to the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwishlist,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a compilation of longshot proposals. Even with unlikely odds of passing, simply placing the proposals on the record is seen by lobbyists and operatives in Austin as a thinly veiled warning to businesses to stay quiet on the voting bills.\nThe Perryman Group, an economic research and analysis firm based in Waco, said in a recent study that implementing controversial voting measures could lead to conferences or events being pulled from the state, and prompt businesses or workers to shun it. The group estimated that restrictive new laws would lead to a huge decrease in business activity in the state by 2025 and cost tens of thousands of jobs.\nAmong the restrictions in two omnibus bills in the Texas Legislature are a ban on 24-hour voting, a ban on drive-through voting and harsh criminal penalties for local election officials who provide assistance to voters. There are also new limits on voting machine distribution that could lead to a reduction in numbers of precincts and a ban on encouraging absentee voting.\nThe bills also include a measure that would make it much more difficult to remove a poll watcher for improper conduct. Partisan poll watchers, who are trained and authorized to observe the election on behalf of a candidate or party, have occasionally crossed the line into voter intimidation or other types of misbehavior; Harris County elections officials said they had received several complaints about Republican poll watchers last year.\nMr. Hollins, the former Harris County clerk, said Republicans recognized that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlack and brown and poor and young people\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99 use the flexible voting options more than others. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re scared of that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\nWhile Republican-controlled legislatures in Georgia and Arizona are passing new voting laws after Democratic victories in November, Texas is pushing new restrictions despite having backed former President Donald J. Trump by more than 600,000 votes. The effort reflects the dual realities confronting Republicans in the State Legislature: a base eager for changes to voting following Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2020 loss and a booming population that is growing more diverse.\nBryan Hughes sponsored the bill in the State Senate that seeks to add voting restrictions. Credit... Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman, via Associated Press.\nSenator Bryan Hughes, a Republican from northeastern Texas who sponsored the State Senate bill, defended it as part of a long effort to strengthen \\xe2\\x80\\x9celection security\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Texas.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI realize there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big national debate now, and maybe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting sucked into that, but this is not something new to Texas,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Hughes said in an interview. He said that lawmakers were seeking to roll back mail voting access because that process was more prone to fraud. He offered no proof, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in the United States is exceptionally rare.\nMr. Hughes said that the proposed ban on drive-through voting stemmed from the difficulty of getting access for partisan poll watchers at the locations and that 24-hour voting was problematic because it was difficult to find poll watchers for overnight shifts.\nBut many voters in Harris County, whose population of 4.7 million ranks third in the country and is bigger than 25 states\\xe2\\x80\\x99, see a different motive.\nKristie Osi-Shackelford, a costume designer from Houston who was working temporary jobs during the pandemic to help support her family, used 24-hour voting because it offered her the flexibility she needed as she juggled work and raising her three children. She said that it had taken her less than 10 minutes.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure there are people who may not have gotten to vote in the last couple of elections, but they had the opportunity at night, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kind of sad that the powers that be feel like that has to be taken away in order to, quote unquote, protect election integrity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Osi-Shackelford said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I struggled to find words, because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so irritating, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tired. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tired of hearing the same stuff and seeing the same stuff so blatantly over and over again for years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBrittany Hyman, 35, was eight months pregnant as Election Day was drawing near and was also raising a 4-year-old. Fearful of Covid-19 but also of the sheer logistics of navigating a line at the polls, Ms. Hyman voted at one of the drive-through locations.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeing able to drive-through vote was a savior for me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Hyman said. She added that because she had been pregnant, she probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have risked waiting in a long line to vote.\nHarris County\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drive-through voting, which more than 127,000 voters took advantage of in the general election, drew immediate attention from state Republicans, who sued Mr. Hollins and the county in an attempt to ban the practice and discard any votes cast in the drive-through process. The Texas Supreme Court ruled against the Republicans in late October.\nOther provisions in the G.O.P. bill, while not aimed as directly at Harris County, will most likely still have the biggest impact in the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest county. One proposal, which calls for a uniform number of voting machines to be deployed in each precinct, could hamper the ability to deploy extra machines in densely populated areas.\nThis month, in a further escalation of public pressure on legislators, Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston, a Democrat, gathered more than a dozen speakers, including business executives, civil rights activists and former athletes, for a 90-minute news conference denouncing the bill.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is happening here in Texas is a warning shot to the rest of the country,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lina Hidalgo, the Harris County judge and a Democrat who has pushed for continued expansion of voting access in the county. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst Georgia, then Texas, then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more and more states, and soon enough we will have taken the largest step back since Jim Crow.

But the data is from 1980, part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment.\nThe campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments \\xe2\\x80\\x9carrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the paper reported.\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its most recent report in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break that down by race.).\nThe Sentencing Project , an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher \\xe2\\x80\\x94 12 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent).\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.\nWhat surveys have shown \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThere is also evidence for Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history.\nStudies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology .\nA 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history.\nAfter controlling for the arrest offense, a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found.\nThe problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity \\xe2\\x80\\x9caccumulates at each level,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a little bit more likely to get arrested if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a person of color than if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re white. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to make it harder for you to get released. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be significant as you go through the stages.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nTonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit depends hugely on what crime you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a drug crime that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affected by mandatory minimums, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vastly longer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tonry said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nHow much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate.

We need your help. .\n \""African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do.\"" .\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have been trying to court black voters ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary by talking about the need to address systemic racism.\nIn a , Clinton says: \""Something is just fundamentally broken when African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do.\"".\nWe wanted to see if there\\'s evidence that being black influences whether someone will be arrested and, once convicted, ordered to do more time.\nThe question plays out against a stark statistic \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although African-Americans make up , they of the inmate population, according to the latest data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.\nThe Clinton campaign pointed out a (referring to ) that said blacks are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs than whites even though whites are 45 percent more likely to sell drugs than blacks. But the data is from 1980, part of that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment.\nThe campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a of arrest rates around the country\\xc2\\xa0in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments \""arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups,\"" the paper reported.\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn\\'t break that down by race.).\n, an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data by Missouri\\'s attorney general\\'s office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher \\xe2\\x80\\x94 12 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent).\nIt\\'s not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there\\'s little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.\nWhat surveys have shown \""is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,\"" said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \""But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don\\'t know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\"".\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThere is also evidence for Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history.\nStudies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology .\nA reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history.\nAfter controlling for the arrest offense, a person\\'s criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found.\nThe problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity \""accumulates at each level,\"" said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project.\n\""You\\'re a little bit more likely to get arrested if you\\'re a person of color than if you\\'re white. You\\'re a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That\\'s going to make it harder for you to get released. You\\'re a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,\"" she said. \""As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it\\'s going to be significant as you go through the stages.\"".\nTonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but \""it depends hugely on what crime you\\'re talking about.\n\""If it\\'s a drug crime that\\'s affected by mandatory minimums, it\\'s vastly longer,\"" Tonry said. \""If you\\'re talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.\"" \\xc2\\xa0.\nHow much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there\\'s a greater demand for police.

Trump has said that the investigations scrutinizing his actions have been driven by his political opponents. Credit... Christopher Lee for The New York Times.\nAs he awaits possible indictment by the Manhattan district attorney and remains under scrutiny in multiple other criminal investigations, former President Donald J. Trump has regularly railed against a justice system that he contends has been deployed against him by his political opponents.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Biden regime\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weaponization of our system of justice is straight out of the Stalinist Russia horror show,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told a rally in Texas on Saturday night.\nBut as is often the case with Mr. Trump, his accusations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 widely repeated by other Republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 reflect his own pattern of conduct: his history of threatening or seeking to employ the expansive powers of the presidency to go after his enemies, real and perceived.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was always telling me that we need to use the F.B.I. and I.R.S. to go after people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was constant and obsessive and is just what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claiming is being done to him now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second White House chief of staff.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would tell him why it was wrong, and while I was there I did everything I could to steer him away from it and tell him why it was a bad idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kelly said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought we were successful, but he would often ask a lot of people to do a lot of things that he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do himself in the hopes that someone would do it and he could claim he did nothing wrong.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nSome of his demands were public, and to some degree a political performance, like his calls, never acted upon, for the prosecution of Hillary Clinton, his defeated rival in the 2016 campaign.\nOther actions were personal, and more petty. He blocked then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi from using a military plane in 2019 to visit troops in Afghanistan. Andrew McCabe was temporarily denied his federal pension upon retiring as deputy director of the F.B.I., after intense criticism from Mr. Trump for his role in the Russia investigation.\nThe Possible Indictment of Donald Trump Specter of Violence Looms: \\xc2\\xa0In a social media post, Donald Trump warned of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotential death and destruction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d if he was indicted . Hours later, the Manhattan district attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office received a threatening letter. Suppressing October Surprises: \\xc2\\xa0The payoff to Stormy Daniels that has a Manhattan grand jury weighing criminal charges against Trump can trace its lineage to political skulduggery in 1968 and 1980 . Perp-Walk Fixation : \\xc2\\xa0As Trump focuses on how an indictment would look , he has appeared significantly disconnected from the severity of his potential legal woes. From Ally to Antagonist : \\xc2\\xa0Michael Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Trump. Now, Cohen is hoping to help prosecutors put him away .\nIn some instances, Mr. Trump acted more quietly and persistently. Among those he wanted to see prosecuted was John F. Kerry, the former senator, Democratic presidential nominee and secretary of state under President Barack Obama.\nMr. Trump maintained that Mr. Kerry had broken the law by staying in touch with Iranian officials with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal that Mr. Trump was unwinding. As president, Mr. Trump repeatedly pressed senior officials behind closed doors about using the Justice Department to target Mr. Kerry, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nUltimately, federal prosecutors in New York were pushed by senior Justice Department officials in Washington to investigate Mr. Kerry, according to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan at the time.\nJohn R. Bolton, who served as Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national security adviser, said the former president is now clearly playing to a base that has increasingly embraced his claims of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweaponization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about a range of investigations, and responded to his portrayal of himself as its victim. But, Mr. Bolton said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe idea that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a paragon of virtue who didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do this to other people and is now a victim of this unfairness really is laughable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAsked to comment about Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of the levers of power to go after his enemies, including Mr. Kerry, a senior consultant to Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, Chris LaCivita, spoke only of Mr. Kerry and reiterated the call for his prosecution, calling him \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca threat to national security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nFor decades, Mr. Trump has generally viewed institutions and systems as entities that reward friends and allies of those leading them and that punish their enemies. It was how he perceived the world of machine politics that surrounded him in New York City as he was growing up. He has long made clear that he believes every system and every person is corruptible.\nJohn F. Kelly, Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second White House chief of staff, said that the former president would regularly suggest using the F.B.I. and I.R.S. against his political opponents. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyone will say anything if you pay them enough. I know that, and you know that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the former C.I.A. director, John Brennan, recalled Mr. Trump saying at their first meeting, in reference to his distrust of human intelligence sources.\nMr. Trump has insisted that he would not be facing the possibility of an indictment in Manhattan on charges related to hush-money payments to a porn star if times were different. He has described Robert M. Morgenthau, who died in 2019 and was a predecessor of the current Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriend of mine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who would not have tolerated a prosecution.\nWhile Mr. Trump did little to hide his desire to use his power against his foes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he often blasted it out on his Twitter account or discussed it publicly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is unclear how much impact his demands had in the face of the reluctance to act on them on the part of aides, prosecutors and others.\nHow Times reporters cover politics. \\xc2\\xa0 We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.\nMr. Trump privately pushed aides like Mr. Kelly to revoke the security clearances of former top intelligence officials who were critical of him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes someone wrote an op-ed criticizing you, but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean you should go and do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Kelly recounted telling Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desire to order the Justice Department to prosecute Mrs. Clinton and James B. Comey, whom he had fired as F.B.I. director, was rebuffed by his White House counsel at the time, Donald F. McGahn II.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsensus has emerged that a key component of ensuring fair criminal proceedings is avoiding even the appearance of political motivation for prosecution or criminal investigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. McGahn wrote. That notion, he added, had solidified in the years after the Watergate scandal, when it was revealed how Richard M. Nixon had tried to target his rivals.\nBut legal experts say the mere knowledge that Mr. Trump tried to use them for his own purposes damages public confidence that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. will follow the law, and the facts, rather than go in a political direction.\nIn the case of Mr. Kerry, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time, Geoffrey Berman, has said there was a direct link between Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s desires and the pressure put on his office to prosecute Mr. Kerry. In a book published in September, Mr. Berman said that two days after Mr. Trump said on Twitter that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe United States does not need John Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in May 2018, Justice Department officials in Washington referred a case to Mr. Berman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office to determine whether Mr. Kerry had broken the law by being in contact with Iranian officials after he left office.\nMr. Berman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office investigated Mr. Kerry in the months that followed. A little less than a year later, Mr. Trump again spoke out on Twitter about Mr. Kerry, repeating the allegation that he had broken the law by remaining in contact with the Iranians.\nThat afternoon, Mr. Berman said, his office received a call from David Burns, a top national security prosecutor at the Justice Department in Washington, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho wanted to know why we were delaying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the inquiry, and why his office had not taken a step that would have given investigators access to parts of Mr. Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s electronic communications.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were asking us, basically, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking so long?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Berman wrote in his book. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you going harder and faster at this enemy of the president? There was no other way for me to look at it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nA spokesman for Mr. Burns\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law firm, Gibson Dunn, where Mr. Burns is now the co-chairman of its national security practice, declined to comment.\nMr. Berman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office ultimately decided against prosecuting Mr. Kerry. Shortly after the office told senior Justice Department officials in Washington of that decision, the chief of staff for Attorney General William P. Barr told Mr. Berman that national security prosecutors in Washington were likely to take Mr. Kerry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case to another U.S. attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office.\nIn April 2020, Mr. Berman said that the U.S. attorney in Maryland, Robert K. Hur, called him to discuss the case, which had been reassigned to Mr. Hur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Like Mr. Berman, Mr. Hur declined to prosecute Mr. Kerry. In January 2023, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland appointed Mr. Hur as a special counsel, to investigate whether President Biden and his aides had mishandled classified documents found at Mr. Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home and in an office he used in Washington."", ""evidence"": ""Former President Donald J.

Prosecutors could argue that Trump tried to conceal violations of federal campaign finance laws \\xe2\\x80\\x94 something Cohen pleaded guilty to in 2018. But a judge might believe the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office is overreaching by enforcing federal law. If the case gets to a jury, jurors may wonder why federal prosecutors didn\\'t bring charges against Trump, or they might not believe Cohen\\'s testimony.\n\""The Stormy case was the easiest, the most straightforward, but had the risk of being nothing more than a misdemeanor,\"" one source told the Daily Beast .\nAccording to the lawyers who worked on the matter, the \""hush money\"" charges were meant to be part of a broader business fraud case against Trump.\nThe investigation into Trump began in 2017 under Bragg\\'s predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., triggered by Cohen\\'s congressional testimony about the payments to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\nIt grew to encompass the finances of the Trump Organization. Prosecutors ultimately brought tax fraud charges against the company and executive Allen Weisselberg \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and won in court \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but didn\\'t charge Trump with the scheme.\nBragg\\'s resistance to charging Trump with financial crimes frustrated former top prosecutor Mark Pomerantz and led him to quit in early 2022 . (Bragg\\'s office has maintained that the evidence collected by Pomerantz wasn\\'t strong enough to bring a winnable case.) Since then, the investigation has moved back to the hush-money payments .\nA representative for the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment. Experts say the case is far from a slam-dunk.\nMark Bederow, a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor for the Manhattan district attorney\\'s office, said a case against Trump solely on the hush-money payments was \""likely to fail.\"".\nThe relatively low stakes and convoluted nature of the anticipated charges could give \""reasonable doubt\"" to jurors hearing the case, according to Bederow.\n\""They have to demonstrate that his intent was to defraud and also that his intent was also to cover up another crime,\"" Bederow told Insider.\nThere are a number of possible reasons why Trump might want to hide the payments to Daniels aside from covering up a campaign finance violation, Bederow said.\n\""What if he did that to protect his own reputation, to protect his wife from humiliation, or some personal reason?\"" Bederow said. \""That\\'s not an intent to defraud.\"".\nTrump has already laid the groundwork for this defense, calling the payments to Daniels part of an \""extortion plot\"" in a video posted to social media on Monday . Trump has maintained that he\\'s done nothing wrong and has derided Bragg\\'s investigation as illegitimate. Joe Tacopina, an attorney for Trump, has said he expects any potential charges against his client to \""eventually get tossed aside.\"".\nAnother hurdle, according to former prosecutors, is that the case rests largely on the testimony of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to charges that he lied to Congress about Trump\\'s business plans . Cohen has since sought to change his image as someone who\\'s come clean about Trump, but jurors might view him as someone with an axe to grind.\n\""The more the case relies on documents instead of the testimony of Michael Cohen, the stronger it will be,\"" Barbara McQuade, the former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, previously told Insider\\'s Sonam Sheth .\n\""That\\'s a disaster as a prosecutor,\"" he said. \""You wouldn\\'t rely on Michael Cohen to tell you the time of day unless you corroborated it with a clock.

In his first speech since the debate, Trump seemed to simultaneously double down on the stance he articulated Wednesday night while also trying to clean it up. .\n Trump argued forcefully during a rally here that he was being asked to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwaive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his right to contest the election after critics slammed him for refusing to pledge to accept the results of the election the previous night during the final presidential debate. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump told supporters here in his first comments since the final debate. .\n After raising concerns about voter fraud \\xe2\\x80\\x93 instances of which are extremely rare \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trump also pledged to accept \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca clear election result.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd always, I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who have come before me. Always.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, echoed Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments while speaking in Reno, Nevada, telling supporters: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, we will accept a clear election result, but we also reserve the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of questionable results.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x98I will keep you in suspense\\xe2\\x80\\x99 .\n Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks Thursday appeared aimed at quelling the outrage he sparked the previous night as Republicans and Democrats alike balked at Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will look at it at the time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when asked if he would concede the election should he lose on November 8. But by refusing again Thursday to promise outright that he will abide by the results of the election, Trump kept alive a worrying conspiracy theory that his underdog candidacy could be defeated by below-board behavior. .\n The remarks came after Trump took intense fire from Republicans and Democrats alike for saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will look at it at the time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d when asked if he would concede the election should he lose on November 8. .\n Trump also said Thursday that he was only refusing to make a blanket statement concerning the results of the election because he wants \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfairness during the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country. We have to have fairness,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. .\n Trump, who has spent weeks calling the election \\xe2\\x80\\x9crigged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and suggesting to his supporters the presidency could be stolen from them, sought to compare his situation to the 2000 election, when Al Gore sought a recount in several counties after the results of the election in Florida were very tight. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Al Gore or George Bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede results and waived their right to a legal challenge or a recount then there would be no Supreme Court case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Trump said of the ensuing legal process following the contested result of the 2000 election. .\n But neither Bush nor Gore raised concerns about the legitimacy of the electoral process, neither before nor after Election Day. And a day after the Supreme Court ruled, Gore called Bush to concede. .\n Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pledge to accept the results of the election \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I win\\xe2\\x80\\x9d could have gone differently on Thursday, based on prepared remarks the Trump campaign released after his speech concluded. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept \\xe2\\x80\\x93 without delay or hesitation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d read the alternate text of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pledge to accept the presidential election results if he wins. .\n The question about accepting the election\\xe2\\x80\\x99s results was posed to Trump on Wednesday night after the Republican nominee spent weeks arguing that there was a mass \\xe2\\x80\\x9cestablishment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d conspiracy seeking to undermine his candidacy. .\n Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crigged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d election came after nearly a dozen women came forward last week alleging that Trump had groped or kissed them without their consent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 prompting a deluge of defections from Republicans who had been supporting his campaign and unfavorable media coverage. .\n But in previous months, Trump had already begun suggesting to his supporters that the election could be stolen, urging them to be vigilant on Election Day and watch for cases of voter fraud, which are extremely rare in the US. .\n World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics The Biden Presidency Facts First US Elections Business Markets Tech Media Success Perspectives Videos Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Formula E Esports Hockey Videos Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features Weather Climate Storm Tracker Wildfire Tracker Video More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN .\n Your CNN account Log in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts .\n\\xc2\\xa9 2023 Cable News Network.

The saliva tests would enable police to determine when drivers have the drug in their system.\\xc2\\xa0\""If the experiences in Colorado and Washington are the experiences we have here, roadway deaths are going to go up, impaired driving is likely to go up,\"" Anderson said .\nA number of readers told us Anderson was off the mark. So we decided to find out: Have legal recreational cannabis markets in Colorado and Washington led to a rise in roadway deaths and impaired driving rates?\\xc2\\xa0.\nIn response, the department sent seven sources -- including five studies and two news articles from the\\xc2\\xa0 Denver Post and the Bellingham Herald . The sources all show that rates of impaired driving and roadway fatalities have increased since cannabis was legalized.\\xc2\\xa0.\nHowever, even that data is contradictory. None of the sources have proven the increase was caused by the legalization of recreational cannabis markets alone, which was the point that Anderson seemed to be making. \\xc2\\xa0.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also important to note that no accurate roadside testing for cannabis impairment currently exists. At this point, law enforcement typically use blood tests to determine whether drivers have THC in their system. The drug, however, can remain in someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blood for weeks, making it difficult to determine the time at which someone is actually under the influence.\\xc2\\xa0.\nA study by the Foundation for Traffic Safety reported in 2016 that an estimated 303 drivers \\xe2\\x80\\x94 10 percent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes in Washington between 2010 and 2014 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, in their blood at or shortly after the time of a crash.\nThe number of drivers who tested positive for THC remained steady before and immediately after legalization took effect, according to the study.\nBut researchers found that about nine months after cannabis was legally available for purchase, the number of drugged driving citations began increasing at a rate of almost 10 percentage points per year. It is unclear whether the increase was caused by the legalization of cannabis or by factors \""that were beyond the scope of the study.\""\\xc2\\xa0.\nA study by the Colorado Department of Transportation published in August 2018 reported that overall, the number of fatalities involving drivers who tested positive for cannabis has nearly doubled since recreational legalization in 2014 -- from 75 that year to 125 in 2016 and 139 in 2017.\nHowever, in spite of cannabis-related driving fatalities going up, in the first quarter of 2017, the number of cannabis-related DUIs dropped by 33 percent from the same period in 2016, according to Colorado State Patrol. From January until March in 2017, 155 people received citations for cannabis impairment while driving, compared to 232 people in 2016.\\xc2\\xa0.\nAnother study last year, conducted by researchers at the University of Oregon, explicitly stated that the argument that legal cannabis has led to a spike in traffic deaths and impaired driving is misleading. The upward trend in cannabis-related fatalities in Colorado, and to some extent in Washington, would have taken place whether or not recreational cannabis was legalized, the authors say.\\xc2\\xa0.\nSome research clearly supports the claim that traffic accidents are on the rise in states that have legalized cannabis, but the reason behind why it is happening remains unclear to researchers.\nA study released in October by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), estimated that the rate of car crashes rose a combined 6 percent following the start of retail sales of recreational cannabis in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.\nBased on our research, Anderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement that roadway deaths and impaired driving rates have gone up in Washington and Colorado is correct. But his implication that a legal recreational cannabis market is responsible for the uptick in impaired driving and traffic deaths has not been proven.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWhile the studies do not prove that legal recreational cannabis markets are the cause of impaired driving and traffic death increases in Colorado or Washington, it does serve as a \""solid indicator\"" that cannabis can impact driver safety.\\xc2\\xa0.\nRocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area report, \"" The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact, Volume 5, \"" September, 2018.\nThe Denver Post, \"" Traffic fatalities linked to marijuana are up sharply in Colorado.

She told us she expects the cash payout to the trust, rather than receiving the stock over time, will benefit Tillerson financially, though she acknowledged that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an open question.\nBut Baldwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about the impact of Tillerson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deal on Exxon Mobil stockholders and the $180 million doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come as a result of Tillerson taking the secretary of state job.\n\""It doesn\\'t appear to be a reward specifically for going into government service, but rather a standard agreement in which he gets the payout as long as he does not work in the (oil) industry for 10 years,\"" said Ari Goldberg, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Project On Government Oversight , a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\nA \""golden parachute\"" typically refers to severance payments executives get after their companies are acquired or made part of a merger.

He noted that the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy states that executives risk losing long-term equity awards by retiring early.\nBut the policy also allows for the company to decide that the executive can keep the awards, which is what it did in making the $180 million agreement.\nRosanna Landis Weaver , executive compensation project manager for Oakland, Calif.-based As You Sow, a national group that advocates for shareholders, also criticized Exxon Mobil for not sticking to its usual practice of long-term vesting. She told us she expects the cash payout to the trust, rather than receiving the stock over time, will benefit Tillerson financially, though she acknowledged that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an open question.\nBut Baldwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about the impact of Tillerson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deal on Exxon Mobil stockholders and the $180 million doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come as a result of Tillerson taking the secretary of state job.\n\""It doesn\\'t appear to be a reward specifically for going into government service, but rather a standard agreement in which he gets the payout as long as he does not work in the (oil) industry for 10 years,\"" said Ari Goldberg, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Project On Government Oversight , a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\nA \""golden parachute\"" typically refers to severance payments executives get after their companies are acquired or made part of a merger. Indeed, the federal tax code refers to parachute payments as compensation paid as a result of a change in control of a company. But the payment Tillerson is getting isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t something extra. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a retirement benefit he had earned.\n\""Tillerson is clearly getting a large cash settlement, but this reflects payments for services earned over the prior many years, and not a cash reward or \\xe2\\x80\\x98parachute\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tied to his resignation,\"" said executive compensation expert Kevin Murphy , a finance and business economics professor at the University of Southern California.\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll note that Baldwin used the lesser known term \""government service golden parachute.\"" But that typically is used by groups such as the AFL-CIO union in reference to Wall Street . It refers to financial incentives Wall Street firms give to senior executives who take government jobs. The concern is whether the companies then expect favorable government treatment from their former executives.\nOthers refer to government-based golden parachutes provided by Wall Street banks as accelerated vesting of equity-based awards for senior executives who resign voluntarily to enter government service -- in other words, compensation that they would otherwise forfeit for failing to meet normal vesting requirements. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more similar to Tillerson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation.\nBut Murphy and another executive compensation expert Steven Balsam , told us it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highly unlikely that Tillerson would have lost out on his retirement benefits, a few months before reaching the mandatory retirement age, simply by taking another job -- unless it was with an Exxon Mobil competitor.\n\""This terms of his retirement/separation were agreed upon prior to his being nominated to be secretary of state. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not getting it because he took the (secretary of state) job,\"" said Balsam, \\xc2\\xa0a business professor at Temple University in Philadelphia.\nBaldwin says Tillerson got a \""government service golden parachute\"" payment of $180 million \""from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere.\"" \\xc2\\xa0.\nBut on Baldwin\\'s larger point, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an earned retirement benefit, not newly added compensation and not something created simply because Tillerson took a government post. He would almost certainly have been in line to receive it even if he had taken a different job, as long as it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t with an Exxon Mobil competitor.\nFor a statement that has an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.\nSays Secretary of State Rex Tillerson got a \""government service golden parachute\"" payment of $180 million \""from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere.\"" .\nInterview, Temple University Fox School of Business professor and Merves senior research fellow Steven Balsam , Feb. 9, 2017 research interests include executive compensation.\nInterview, University of Southern California Marshall School of Business\u2019 Kenneth L.

The charge of the COVID mRNA vaccines being a depopulation bioweapon made here is not an idle one; many scientists and doctors are saying the same thing today while explaining why and how in slightly different ways currently. .\nThe theories put forward by Dr. Geert Vannden Bosche regarding mutating viruses are echoed here by Dr. Coleman\u2013while other scientists (Dr. Mike Yeadon for instance) who question Dr. Bosche\u2019s statements and theories also suggest the vaccine is a bioweapon which will cause genocide on a massive scale, explaining why in a slightly different way (to be posted shortly). .\nThat these vaccines are likely to cause mass deaths within the next four years in addition to disability on an astronomical scale is emphasized here, along with a mention of \u201cpathogenic priming\u201d and dangers to all vaccinated of \u201ccytokine storms\u201d in presence of the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus or any newly forming mutated version of the virus\u2013that is, the virus putatively seen as responsible for COVID-19, which has never been isolated. .\nDr. Coleman refers to a destabilizing of the immune system of millions whereby everyone vaccinated \u201chas the potential to become a mass murderer because their bodies will become laboratories making lethal viruses\u201d and then shedding these viruses, even as asymptomatic carriers, endangering others (who are mRNA-vaccinated) whose immune systems have been destroyed and displaced by the systems created by the mRNA vaccines. .\nI personally question the existence of viruses as an infecting mechanism after examining the information on exosomes presented by many today especially Dr. Andy Kaufmann and learning further that the Spanish flu was not transmitted to others by secretions from sick patients as widely presumed ( Fauci in fact published on bacterial pneumonia from the upper respiratory tract killing off vast numbers of people, not a flu virus), as well as examining Terrain Theory as presented by many doctors especially Dr. Zara Anna Bourgeois who discussed this at Ramola D Reports , but am posting this here for purposes of information, and especially for medical professionals who have their own theories and greater understanding of this situation\u2013please research further on your own and draw your own conclusions. .\nEither way it is clear to me after speaking with several doctors and molecular biologists and watching many videos and presentations that governments and mainstream media are lying outright about the vaccines\u2019 \u201csafety and efficacy\u201d and that people are indeed dying and suffering after taking the Pfizer BioNTech Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines: .\nThe New York Times is wrong in suggesting, as the CDC suggests, that the deaths and disability reactions recorded at the CDC website from those who have taken the mRNA vaccines are not cause for alarm, cannot be causatively linked to the vaccines, and mean nothing because they statistically register as a tiny blip on the screen\u2013these numbers are rising and if the vaccines are not halted stat, \u201cstatistical significance\u201d will start to matter soon: Promoting the COVID Psy Op: Neil MacFarquhar of The New York Times Ignores the Facts & Pushes False-Narratives . .\nI echo Dr. Coleman\u2019s overall message, for reasons of the bodily and brain destruction accruing from the mRNA vaccines, as described by many doctors, including Dr. Carrie Madej, Dr. Sherrie Tenpenny, Dr. Judy Mikovits, Dr. Christiane Northrup, Dr. Andy Wakefield, Dr. Rima Laibow, Dr. Dolores Cahill: Do Not Take the COVID-19 Vaccines: Reports & Videos of Convulsions, Seizures, Palsy, Death Are\u00a0Increasing .\nCODE RED: Dr. Carrie Madej: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoratorium Needed on All Pfizer/Moderna mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Now Seen To Produce Deadly Side-Effects Including Death\\xe2\\x80\\x93Experimental, High-Risk, Sterilizing,\u00a0Dangerous! .\n68-Year-Old Dies After Anaphylactic Reaction to COVID Vaccine as CDC Continues to Ignore Inquiry Into Increasing Number of Deaths | Megan Redshaw, Children\u2019s Health Defense, March 26, 2021 .\nEntire City in Shock as Another Italian Professor is DEAD Following the AstraZeneca COVID Injection | Health Impact News, March 28, 2021 .\nDesir\\xc3\\xa9e Penrod: 25-year-old Connecticut educator dead one week after Johnson & Johnson viral vector shot | The COVID Blog, March 22, 2021 .\n \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in Depopulation Agendas , Global Depopulation , Waking Up and tagged Dr. Vernon Coleman , Genocide , Human Race , Note , Ramola D , Weapons of Mass Destruction .

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just the Republican side that does that, says a social media meme that makes the charge against Democrat Joe Biden.\nThe episode involved his son Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work on behalf of a Ukrainian energy company at a time when the elder Biden was vice president and a key figure in U.S. policy on Ukraine. The story has been public for years, but it received new attention with Biden running strong among 2020 Democratic presidential contenders.\nOne viral image being shared on social media used a bit of reverse psychology, asking what Americans would think if the details of this story involved the Trump family rather than the Biden family. (Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2016 campaign chair Paul Manafort was convicted of tax and bank fraud for laundering millions in income he earned working for Ukrainian politicians.).\n\""Did you know that Donald Trump Jr. was named a director to Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest private gas producer following a Ukrainian visit by President Trump? Trump later threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fire a prosecutor looking into Don Jr.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company. Just kidding! That was Joe Biden when he was VP, and his son Hunter Biden.\"".\nIs it true, as the image suggests, that Hunter Biden was serving as \""a director to Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest private gas producer\"" when the elder Biden \""threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fire a prosecutor looking into\"" the gas company?.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Hunter Biden did hold a directorship for a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\\xc2\\xa0Experts agree that Hunter Biden\\'s acceptance of the position\\xc2\\xa0created a\\xc2\\xa0conflict of interest for his father.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Vice President Joe Biden did\\xc2\\xa0urge\\xc2\\xa0Ukraine\\xc2\\xa0to fire its top prosecutor, with the threat of withholding U.S. aid.\\xc2\\xa0But that was the position of the wider U.S. government, as well as other international institutions. \\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 We found no evidence to support the idea\\xc2\\xa0that Joe Biden advocated with his son\\'s interests in mind, as the message suggests. It\\'s not even clear that the company was actively under investigation or that a\\xc2\\xa0change in prosecutors\\xc2\\xa0benefited it.\nReuters reported at the time that a statement on the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website said the younger Biden \""would help the company with \""transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion,\"" and other issues. The company also retained the law firm where Biden had been working, Boies Schiller Flexner.\nThe position with Burisma came at a time when the younger Biden had joined with Christopher Heinz (the stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.) and Devon Archer (a Kerry family friend) in a string of investment and consulting firms. Firms run by Biden and Archer \""pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,\"" the New York Times reported .\nBiden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Burisma directorship attracted attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor F. Yanukovych who subsequently went into exile after a popular revolution. After Yanukovych was ousted, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving his business.\nIn 2015, Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newly appointed prosecutor general Viktor Shokin inherited some of the investigations into Zlochevsky and his company. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.) Shokin was ousted as prosecutor in 2016. Shokin is the prosecutor the viral post is talking about\\xc2\\xa0(more on that later).\nThe Biden campaign told PolitiFact that the vice president learned about his son\\'s role on the board through media reports and never discussed anything related to this company with his son.\nIn a White House press briefing on May 13, 2014 , spokesman Jay Carney was asked about it, and whether it presented the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nCarney said, \""I would refer you to the Vice President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. I saw those reports. Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the Vice President or President. But I would refer you to the Vice President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office.\"".\nA year and a half later, the New York Times published an article that suggested that \""the credibility of the vice president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anti-corruption message may have been undermined\"" by Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dealings with the company.\n\""Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer,\"" she said. \""The vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company. The vice president has pushed aggressively for years, both publicly with groups like the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum and privately in meetings with Ukrainian leaders, for Ukraine to make every effort to investigate and prosecute corruption in accordance with the rule of law. It will once again be a key focus during his trip this week.\"".\nHunter Biden told the New York Times this month in a statement that \""at no time have I discussed with my father the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business, or my board service, including my initial decision to join the board.\"".\nThe post said Biden\\xc2\\xa0threatened to withhold $1 billion\\xc2\\xa0unless the prosecutor -- Shokin -- was fired.\\xc2\\xa0Biden didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just make a threat to withhold aid unless Shokin was sacked -- it succeeded.\nBiden proudly recounted the moment during an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018 . Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the relevant portion of Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience:.\n\""I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. ...\n\""They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You have no authority. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not the president.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I said, call him. I said, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting the money.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"".\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a strong case that Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position with the company had nothing to do with Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position on Shokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ouster. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s removal, arguing that he was not pursuing corruption cases aggressively.\\xc2\\xa0.\nFor instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that \""it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue\"" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate.\nSteven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that \""virtually everyone\"" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \""felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.\"".\nDaria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, tweeted earlier this month that Shokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s firing was not about protecting the company Hunter Biden was working for. The firing \""was obviously not because the prosecutor wanted to investigate Burisma & Zlochevsky,\"" she wrote.\nHowever, Vitaliy Kasko, who had been Shokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deputy overseeing international cooperation before resigning in February 2016 citing corruption in the office, produced documents to Bloomberg that under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma had been dormant.\n\""There was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,\"" Kasko told Bloomberg. \""It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\"".\nWe found wide agreement among Ukraine policy experts that Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to become a director for Burisma presented a serious conflict of interest.\n\""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a crime, but it is a lapse. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s troubling,\"" said Lincoln A. Mitchell, an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies who has written about governance in the former Soviet Union.\nPifer, who expressed reservations about the arrangement to the New York Times in 2015, said subsequent developments have only confirmed those concerns.\n\""It was a mistake for Hunter Biden to join the Burisma board, particularly given that the vice president was the senior U.S. official engaging Ukraine,\"" Pifer said. \""Hunter Biden should have been more mindful of his father\\'s position.\"".\nAnd Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin professor who previously headed the university\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia, said Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hiring echoes the strategy common within Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, in which powerful interests try to secure influence on foreign policy by leveraging family members and associates of key leaders.\n\""Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,\"" Herrera said. \""Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.\"".\nThe viral image said that when Hunter Biden was serving as \""a director to Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest private gas producer,\"" his father \""threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fire a prosecutor looking into\"" the gas company.\nThe image gets individual pieces of this assertion right -- Hunter Biden was a director of the company, and Joe Biden did leverage U.S. aid to fire a prosecutor. But it overreaches by assuming that Joe Biden acted to protect the company his son was affiliated with. In reality, there was widespread agreement in the West that the existing prosecutor had to go, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not clear that the company would have benefited from his ouster anyway, given evidence that its cases had long been dormant.\nCORRECTION, May 8, 2019 : This version clarifies that Hunter Biden and Devon Archer were the two partners who \""pursued business with international entities.\"" Christopher Heinz was not a part of those pursuits.\nWhen Joe Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son Hunter was serving as \""a director to Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest private gas producer,\"" the elder Biden \""threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fire a prosecutor looking into\"" the gas company.\nStrana.ua, \"" Viktor Shokin: \u2018Lutsenko on his knees asked Poroshenko to appoint him Prosecutor General, and now he is saving himself ,\u2019 \"" May 6, 2019.\nNew York Times, \"" Biden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions That Are Being Promoted by Trump and Allies ,\"" May 1, 2019.\nEmail interview with Yoshiko Herrera, University of Wisconsin professor who previously headed the university\u2019s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia, May 3, 2019.\nInterview with Lincoln A.

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Donald Trump Jr. and others \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from work in the Ukraine by virtue of his family connections, even as he seemed to lack any requisite business credentials.\nThen on Oct. 14, three weeks before Election Day, the New York Post published a front-page story with a headline promising proof:.\nThe article relies on information from a computer hard drive that the tabloid said it received from President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. For all the smoke in the headline, the article offers little fire.\nThe emails cited in the article, which we are not able to verify, do not establish that such a meeting ever occurred.\nHunter Biden, who has a law degree from Yale University and co-founded a business consulting firm, held a directorship for a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, while his father was vice president. Experts agree that Hunter Biden\\'s acceptance of the position created a conflict of interest for his father.\nIn 2015, Viktor Shokin, Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top prosecutor general, was in charge of investigating corruption associated with Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky. But several Western leaders, activists and institutions argued Shokin was not pursuing corruption aggressively enough. They were largely united in seeking Shokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s removal.\nAs vice president, Joe Biden urged Ukraine to fire Shokin, and threatened to withhold U.S. aid. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son\\'s interests in mind. Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position was that of the U.S. government and its allies.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not clear that the company would have benefited from Shokin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ouster anyway, given evidence that investigations into Burisma had long been dormant.\n\""Hunter Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company, according to emails obtained by The Post.\n\""The never-before-revealed meeting is mentioned in a message of appreciation that Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Burisma, allegedly sent Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015, about a year after Hunter joined the Burisma board at a reported salary of up to $50,000 a month.\n\""\\xe2\\x80\\x98Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s realty (sic) an honor and pleasure,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the email reads.\"".\nNone of the emails included with the article, however, point to a meeting having taken place. And an image in the article of the email that the Post calls \""blockbuster correspondence\"" does not contain any of the metadata \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as a message ID number, and the time and date the email was created \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that would help establish the authenticity of an email.\nNo such meeting was reported by a Senate Republican investigation, led by Johnson, into corruption allegations against Joe and Hunter Biden involving Ukraine. The investigation report released in late September contained no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by the former vice president.\n\""They never had a meeting,\"" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told PolitiFact, referring to Joe Biden and the Ukrainian businessman cited in the article. He added: \""The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story,\"" including that Giuliani \""claimed to have such materials.\"".\nWe asked one of the authors of the New York Post report for the emails that the article relies on, but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a response. We also did not get a response from Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyer, George Mesires.\nFacebook and Twitter responded to the article by limiting the sharing of the story and other stories by the newspaper on the same topic.

So it raised eyebrows when Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son Hunter was hired by a Ukrainian gas company.\nThe Obama White House said at the time that there was no conflict because the younger Biden was a private citizen. And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.\nYet the matter is back in the spotlight following revelations that President Donald Trump prodded Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president to help him investigate any corruption related to Joe Biden, now one of the top Democrats seeking to defeat Trump in 2020. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani has also publicly urged Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.\nHunter Biden was named a paid board member of Burisma Holdings in April 2014. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founder was a political ally of Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Russia-friendly president, who was driven out in February 2014 by mass protests.\nYanukovych\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ouster prompted the Obama administration to move quickly to deepen ties with Ukraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new government. Joe Biden played a leading role, traveling to Ukraine and speaking frequently with its new Western-friendly president.\nThe younger Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business role raised concerns among anticorruption advocates that Burisma was seeking to gain influence with the Obama administration. At the time, the company ran a natural gas extraction operation in Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia after Yanukovych was pushed from power.\nHunter Biden has denied using his influence with his father to aid Burisma. He remained on the board through early 2019, often appearing at energy-related conferences abroad representing Burisma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests.\nThe matter, however, has continued to be questioned by Trump and his allies. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve pointed in particular to Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move in March 2016 to pressure the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had previously led an investigation into Burisma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner.\nBiden was representing the official position of the U.S. government, a position that was also supported by other Western governments and many in Ukraine, who accused Shokin of being soft on corruption.\nCorruption has continued to fester in Ukraine. In May, the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, came into office with no political experience but with bold promises to put an end to the corrupt practices.\nAround this time, Giuliani began reaching out to Zelenskiy and his aides to press for a government investigation into Burisma and Hunter Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role with the company.\nIn a Fox News interview on May 19, Trump claimed the former Ukrainian prosecutor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas after\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Joe Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son and that was why the former vice president demanded he be fired. There is no evidence of this.\nUkraine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, was quoted by Bloomberg News in May as saying he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son. Bloomberg also reported that the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time Biden pressed for Shokhin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ouster."", ""score"": ""0.3539011"", ""evidence"": ""In 2014, then-Vice President Joe Biden was at the forefront of American diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine's fragile democratic government as it sought to fend off Russian aggression and root out corruption.

Nor does it show California is experiencing a disproportionate share of the 2018 increase, he said.\n\""Unless this were to continue for months and months and months and break the seasonal pattern, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s any real way to claim (the early part of 2018) is a crisis.\"".\nGov. Jerry Brown claimed in a recent letter to the Trump administration: \""there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California).\"".\nResearchers point out that illegal border crossings account for only one portion of the migrants that arrive in California. Others come to the state legally on visas which they later overstay.\nBut given the context of Brown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear the governor was referring to the lack of a wave of migrants coming illegally across the Southern border.\n\""Here are the facts: there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California.

This guide will lead you to the most useful Facebook privacy settings, plus a few outside tools to further limit the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tracking. .\nBelow, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find instructions on how to: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClear\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Data Facebook Gets From Tracking You Around the Web Keep Your Location Data Private Limit Data Collection by Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Partners Guard Your Account From Hackers Make Your Profile Harder to Find Limit Who Sees Your Photos and Posts Take Some Control Over Targeted Ads Avoid Ads on Sensitive Subjects Prevent Facebook From Following You on Other Websites Decide Who Can Message You Protect Your Privacy on Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sibling Products Clean Up Your Friends List .\nFacebook collects a lot of data about you even when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not on Facebook. Hundreds of thousands of apps, websites, and other services send the company reams of information about what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing on other parts of the internet\\xe2\\x80\\x94and sometimes even what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up to in the real world. .\nIt houses the Clear History button, which, despite the name, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually delete anything. Instead, it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisconnects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the data from your account, preventing the company from using it for targeted ads. .\nFacebook keeps a copy of that information\\xe2\\x80\\x94and will continue to use it for analytics reports provided to other websites and detailed performance measurements for the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advertising clients. .\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also find a setting called Manage Future Activity, which lets you keep your history cleared by default. Note that after you turn it off, other companies will keep sending Facebook information about you. But again, Facebook says that the data won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be used to target you with ads. .\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a major caveat. Turning off Future Activity disables the Facebook Login tool that lets you sign in to other apps and websites using your Facebook credentials. You can go through a list one by one and disable Future Off-Facebook Activity for specific services where you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need Facebook Login. .\nOn a computer: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Your Facebook information > Off-Facebook activity. .\nFrom there, you can click \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClear previous activity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d To prevent the data from being used for targeted ads going forward, tap \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDisconnect future activity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nWhen you use the Facebook mobile app, whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re scrolling through your news feed, tagging a family photo on the Golden Gate Bridge, or just leaving the app idling in the background, the company can collect data about your location to use for targeting ads. .\nThe most accurate source of location data can be controlled through your device\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location services settings. Adjusting that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop the company from accessing your location entirely, though. Facebook admits it uses information such as your network connection to approximate your whereabouts for advertising purposes. But if you revoke the Facebook app\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location permission, the data available to the company will be less precise. .\nOn an Android phone: Go to the phone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Settings > Location > App location permissions > Facebook > Select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllow only while using the app\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (These instructions may vary slightly depending on what phone you have. On older phones, check for a Permissions menu.) .\nOn an iPhone: Go to the phone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Facebook. Then click either \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile Using the App\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nOnly the newest version of Android provides the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly while using the app\\xe2\\x80\\x9d option. Users with older Android phones can access a location setting in the Facebook app itself to get the same effect. Find a Background Location setting in the Location menu under Privacy Shortcuts. .\nThe Facebook Login feature is an easy way to sign in to other websites and apps. But as described above, Facebook gets to collect more of your personal data in exchange. It can also give the companies that provide those outside services access to account info, which can include your name, photo, email address, and other data visible to the public by default, such as your \\xe2\\x80\\x9clikes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and comments. .\nIt may be impossible to find and delete personal info harvested by other companies in the past, but you can see which apps are currently collecting data from your account and stop them. You will no longer be able to access these apps using your Facebook Login, so by default Facebook will notify the app so they have opportunity to provide you with another way to log in. (You can disable that using a check box when you remove the app.) .\nOn a computer: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Apps and Websites > See More > Click on the box next to the app\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name > Remove. .\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good idea to use two-factor authentication , also called multifactor authentication, to bolster the password on any account that offers it. This is particularly important if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever used the same password on more than one account or you tend to use subpar passwords. (Consumer Reports has expert tips for creating good passwords.) .\nOnce you turn on two-factor authentication in Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s settings, the company will send you a verification code\\xe2\\x80\\x94via text or app\\xe2\\x80\\x94to confirm your identity when you access your account from an unverified location, device, or browser. .\nBut Facebook has misused this technology. After an investigation a few years ago, the company admitted it used phone numbers collected for two-factor authentication for advertising purposes . .\nSecurity experts still recommend that you use two-factor authentication, however, because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the best ways to protect your account. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to give Facebook your phone number to use two-factor authentication, either\\xe2\\x80\\x94a dedicated app such as Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile can be a more private and secure solution. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to set up. .\nIf Facebook already has your phone number, follow the instructions in the section below so that strangers can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it to find your page. .\nOn a computer: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Security and Login > Set Up Two-Factor Authentication > Get Started. .\nThe default settings on Facebook permit your user profile to show up in any Google search that includes your name. But you can change the settings to make your profile less Google-able. And while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at it, you can also set limits on who can send you friend requests and look you up using the email address or phone number tied to your account. .\nOn a computer: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Privacy > Do you want search engines outside of Facebook to link to your profile? > Edit > Click the check box on the bottom > Turn Off. .\nThen on the same page, select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho can look you up using the phone number you provided?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d > Only me. Do the same for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho can look you up using the email address you provided?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIt can be fun to share the details of your life with family members and friends, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less amusing to serve up that data to criminals who comb Facebook pages for personal details to use in identity-theft scams . If you leave your info open to the public, anyone can discover your birth date, mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maiden name, and passion for poodles. .\nEach time you post a new photo, video, or status update, Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interface gives you the option to keep the news among your friends. You can even exclude certain pals\\xe2\\x80\\x94like, say, your boss or a nosy neighbor. .\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good practice going forward, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also easy to go back to your old posts and limit the audience retroactively. That way, you can make certain you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sharing telltale details with people you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. While you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at it, you can change the default audience so that your future posts are more private automatically. .\nOn a computer: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Privacy > Who can see your future posts? > Edit. Select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFriends\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or another group you may have set up. .\nThen on the same page, click \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLimit the audience for posts you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve shared with friends of friends or Public?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLimit Past Posts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThere isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much you can do to keep your information away from Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marketing services. But there is a lot you can do to take some control over the kinds of ads you see (in fact, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve written a whole guide to controlling annoying or upsetting ads). .\nThere are three Facebook settings worth thinking about. The first is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cData about your activity from partners.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The specifics are complicated, but the bottom line is that if you turn the setting off, Facebook says it will avoid using some of the data it gets about what you do on other companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 websites and services for its own ads. .\nThe second is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAds shown off of Facebook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Facebook doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just show you ads on Facebook; the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ad system runs all over the internet and even in other apps. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAds shown off of Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d setting determines whether advertisers can use information based on your Facebook activity to target you on other platforms. .\nFinally, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably seen Facebook ads that list your friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99 names: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo-and-so likes\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xc2\\xa0.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because Facebook lets advertisers use your name and products you \\xe2\\x80\\x9clike\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94Girl Scout Cookies, Starbucks coffee, Ford trucks\\xe2\\x80\\x94in ads pitched to people in your network. You can turn off the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSocial Interactions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d setting to put a stop to it. .\nOn a computer: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Ads > On the left-hand side, select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAd Settings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d > Select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cData about your activity from partners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and turn the toggles off. Then do the same for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAds shown off of Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSocial Interactions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n(Facebook has recently been rolling out updates to its advertising settings. The last few instructions may be slightly different on some accounts, but they will be close enough that you should be able to find your way.) .\nYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn off Facebook ads, but you can try to avoid ads on certain topics. If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a subject or a brand you want to avoid, you can type it into a search bar and you may be able to limit whether those ads are delivered to you. Facebook also recommends a few subjects that are commonly sensitive for some people, including alcohol, gambling, parenting, pets, politics, and weight loss. However, the company doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guarantee you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never see ads on any of these topics, even if you turn them off. .\nOn a computer: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Ads > Ad Topics > Click the search bar to see some recommended selections, or search for the topic you want to avoid. Click on the topic, and select \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee fewer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nAs we discussed above, Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data collection doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop when you leave the platform . If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever gone to a website that uses Facebook services\\xe2\\x80\\x94Like and Share buttons, Facebook Login, or the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invisible analytics tools\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve provided info on the stories you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read, the videos you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve watched, and the products you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve looked at. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf those buttons are on the page, regardless of whether you touch them, Facebook is collecting data,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Casey Oppenheim, a co-founder of the digital security firm Disconnect. .\nMillions of websites also use Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hidden tracking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpixels\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that give you no visual clue you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being monitored. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no foolproof way to stop that surveillance\\xe2\\x80\\x94and no way at all through Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s settings. You can, however, install an ad blocking extension such as Disconnect, uBlock, or Privacy Badger on your browser to disrupt Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to track you online. .\nThe Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox browser, has designed an ad blocker specifically for this task. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called Facebook Container , and it uses a unique browser tab to wall off the social media platform from the rest of your online activity. It takes only a few clicks to install the Facebook Container extension for Firefox. .\nYou won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a notification about these messages, and Facebook lets you read them without telling the other person you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken a look. That gives you a little preview before you decide to open up a dialog. .\nHowever, you can decide not to receive these messages at all. Or you can go in the other direction with some kinds of connections and have messages open up straight to a regular chat. Because the company combined the messaging platforms on Instagram and Facebook Messenger, there are also some options for communicating with Instagram followers you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t friended on Facebook. .\nOn a browser: Click your profile picture in the top right of the Facebook home page > Settings & privacy > Settings > Privacy > Under \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow you get message requests,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d tap the various potential connections to choose how you want to be contacted. .\nAdjusting your Facebook settings is a great first step toward protecting your privacy. But the apps on your phone and the services you use online unite to form an entire data ecosystem, and you should take the whole picture into account. .\nIf you use Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x94or now Meta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Instagram and WhatsApp , lock down your settings on those products, too. (And now that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on a roll, consider doing the same for other services, such as Google and even LinkedIn .) .\nWhile Facebook closed the loophole that allowed the 2014 data leak that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal , there are plenty of other ways friends can let you down\\xe2\\x80\\x94by posting inappropriate content, for example, or falling for scams that permit accounts to be hacked. .\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best not to maintain Facebook \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfriendships\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with people you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really know (e.g., your best friend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yoga instructor). Facebook doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it easy to delete large groups of friends. You have to go to your Facebook profile, select people to dismiss one at a time, hover over a drop-down menu, and choose \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnfriend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTo make the process a little easier, consider using the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbirthday method.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When you log in to Facebook, check the birthday notifications the app has sent you, and for each one decide whether to send out well wishes or to quietly unfriend people you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re willing to part with . This can help you keep your account more secure. .\nDo you often see online ads that relate to your likes and hobbies? On the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Consumer 101 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d TV show, Consumer Reports expert Thomas Germain explains to host Jack Rico what targeted ads are and how they work. .\nI want to live in a world where consumers take advantage of technology, not the other way around. Access to reliable information is the way to make that happen, and that\\'s why I spend my time chasing it down. When I\\'m off the clock, you can find me working my way through an ever-growing list of podcasts. Got a tip?

The WHO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guidance merely reminded labs to follow instructions provided by each test\u2019s manufacturer. Full Story .\nA recent memo from the World Health Organization designed for lab professionals became a major focus of misinformation \u2014 with unreliable websites and social media users claiming the agency had changed a testing protocol and admitted that COVID-19 cases have been wildly inflated. .\nInstead, the Jan. 20 memo directed labs facilitating polymerase chain reaction, or\\xc2\\xa0 PCR , tests to carefully follow manufacturer instructions for testing to prevent false positive and negative results . .\n\u201cAn Hour After Joe Biden Is Sworn In, WHO Admits Their Testing Grossly Overstates Individuals Testing Positive for COVID,\u201d read a \\xc2\\xa0 headline from the Gateway Pundit, a website known for spreading misinformation. The story questioned the motives of public health agencies, asking, \u201chow can these entities ever be trusted again?\u201d .\nAnother website, Zero Hedge, which also has previously spread falsehoods, similarly \\xc2\\xa0 told readers: \u201cRight On Cue For Biden, WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce COVID False Positives.\u201d That story was shared on Facebook nearly 7,000 times. .\nMany posts also cited a viral \\xc2\\xa0 tweet from David Samadi, a urologist and contributor to the conservative news channel Newsmax, whose work in a New York hospital was the subject of a federal investigation into fraudulent Medicare claims. That hospital reached a $12.3 million settlement in late 2019. .\nIn his tweet, which has since been deleted, Samadi said the guidance instructed labs \u201cto reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases,\u201d because \u201ct he current cycle was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case.\u201d One Facebook post sharing Samadi\u2019s tweet claimed that the guidance proved \u201c they\u2019ve been lying to you about case counts and mortality rate THE WHOLE TIME.\u201d .\nAs we said, the WHO guidance implied\\xc2\\xa0no such admission. And the memo was an updated version of one issued a month earlier, on Dec. 14, so the idea that it was timed for Biden\u2019s inauguration is wrong. .\nAs we\u2019ve explained before , PCR tests work by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. (See our SciCheck article \u201c The Facts on Coronavirus Testing .\u201d) .\nThe PCR test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus\u2019s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load, meaning more virus is present in the sample, will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles. .\nThere is no universal threshold setting or endpoint \u2014 \u201calthough 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint\u201d of a PCR run \u2014 Ian MacKay , a virologist in Australia, told us in an email.\\xc2\\xa0 .\nThe WHO\u2019s Jan. 20 guidance said it was requesting that those conducting tests be sure to read manufacturer instructions \u201ccarefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended.\u201d .\nIn a statement to FactCheck.org, the WHO said it had received 10 reports since early 2020 about some PCR tests providing both false positive and false negative results and that \u201c[a] fter thorough investigation, WHO confirmed that the tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\u201d\\xc2\\xa0 .\n\u201cIn particular, users in laboratories encountered problems with these tests when they did not apply the recommended positivity threshold \u2014 this can result in either false negative results (if the threshold applied is lower) or false positives (if threshold is higher),\u201d the WHO said. .\n\u201cI suspect this is more a problem for certain countries or jurisdictions where rapid roll-out of new testing labs has occurred; labs that are new to public health testing,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cThis would typically involve places that have failed to adequately invest in a good public health laboratory network, to begin with. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think anything shows changing threshold values or less experienced laboratories have driven significant inflation of COVID-19 case counts though.\u201d .\nKelly Wroblewski , director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said in a phone interview that the WHO guidance was a simple reminder that \\xc2\\xa0 if lab professionals deviate from the recommended manufacturer thresholds\\xc2\\xa0they\u2019re \u201cgoing to over- or under-call the positives or negatives.\u201d She said the issue was not a significant concern in the U.S. .\nIn a blog post batting down the misconceptions about the WHO\u2019s guidance, MacKay wrote that \u201cthis lab-focused advice has been taken by those with malicious intent, or with too little understanding of the topic, and blown it up into something else entirely wrong.\u201d .\nHe further emphasized to us that \u201c PCR results are not a diagnosis by themselves\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re part of the COVID-19 diagnosis. WHO advises they be considered in context of other factors, including symptoms and potential exposure to COVID-19. Understanding Cycle Threshold Values .\nPCR tests are considered a gold standard for diagnostics among scientists, and while false negative and positive results are possible with any test, false positives from PCR tests are not thought to be a major or systemic issue \u2014 even positive results at high-cycle threshold values \u2014 experts say. .\nFor example, MacKay has observed that, looking at COVID-19 data on tests in the United Kingdom, even reducing the \u201ccycle number by 10 (from, for example, 45 to 35), for the sake of appeasement, the majority of positives would still be uncontroversially positive.\u201d .\nMatthew Binnicker , a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, said the true debate over results at high-cycle threshold values isn\u2019t whether they are \u201cfalse positives.\u201d .\n\u201cPCR tests are very specific, and these are not false-positives,\u201d he told us in an email. \u201cThe test is doing what it was designed to do \u2014 detect the viral RNA in samples.\u201d .\nInstead, he said, the tension among scientists concerns whether the values can be used \u201c to determine whether someone is, or is not, \u2018infectious\\'\u201d to others. In other words, the question isn\u2019t whether someone contracted the coronavirus, but rather, whether that person is likely to still be contagious and should be told to isolate and have their contacts traced.\\xc2\\xa0 .\n\u201cSome would argue that we should be ignoring low-positive PCR results (i.e., those with a high PCR cycle threshold value), as these results may mean that someone is no longer infectious,\u201d Binnicker said. .\nBut, he said, such a result could also mean that a person only very recently became infected and has yet to hit peak infectiousness. .\nAnd, he cautioned, the quality and type of sample can also affect how many cycles are needed to detect the virus, so it\u2019s not always the case that a high-cycle result means a person is harboring remnants or only small amounts of the virus. .\nMichael Mina , an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, likewise said getting positive test results at high-cycle threshold values \u201cdoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re false positive, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still actually detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\u201d .\nMina said during a call with reporters that the WHO\u2019s memo served as a reminder that \u201c you have to be discerning about how to evaluate\u201d cycle threshold values. \u201cAnd if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start using the actual values from the PCR as part of your decision-making,\\xc2\\xa0 [it\u2019s important] to really know what it is you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\u201d .\nFor example, if someone is asymptomatic and happened to get a PCR test through testing as part of surveillance in a community, it may be a low viral load detected at a high-cycle threshold value \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which could mean \u201cyou already were infectious and you maybe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be isolated,\u201d he said. .\n\u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to know that. You need to do repeated testing, you need to take that person and test them again,\u201d he added. \u201cOr, test them with an antigen test. That would be the other way to approach it.\u201d (Antigen tests are a\\xc2\\xa0 different type \\xc2\\xa0of test that can be used to quickly identify an active coronavirus infection.) .\nBinnicker also noted that, since patients who test positive for COVID-19 can sometimes continue to test positive long after recovering, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn\u2019t recommend PCR tests be used to determine when someone is no longer infectious. Instead, the agency advises relying on time and symptoms to break from quarantine or isolation. .\nEditor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a large presence of virus in the sample, fewer cycles would be required to detect it, said Davidson Hamer, a professor of medicine at Boston University.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe number of cycles required to detect the virus in a sample is known as a \""cycle threshold.\"" A low cycle threshold implies that a patient has a high risk of spreading the coronavirus to others.\nThe question for lab technicians is how many times to duplicate a particular sample before determining whether it is positive or negative.\\xc2\\xa0.\nAs a result, a sample that tests positive after many amplification cycles is more likely to be a false positive than a sample that tests positive after fewer cycles. Nevertheless, Hamer said, false positives with PCR tests, even those with relatively high cycle thresholds, remain rare.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""PCR tests are considered the gold standard of diagnostic tests,\"" said Maureen Ferran, an associate professor of biology at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\\xc2\\xa0.\nJoshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, cautioned against viewing a low cycle threshold value as a strict indicator of high infectivity,\\xc2\\xa0 because some samples are less representative of the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall viral load than others.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""It depends on how good the sample is,\"" he said.

(Milwaukee Journal Sentinel photo) .\nAiming to defeat Democrat Russ Feingold and win re-election on Nov. 8, 2016, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is turning to Green Bay Packers fans for support, confident that they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fans of the rival Minnesota Vikings.\n\""There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing like watching the Packers win on Sunday. But for some in Wisconsin, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not possible. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re forced to watch Viking games.\"".\n\""Ron Johnson believes all Wisconsinites deserve to enjoy Packer games, and their local news,\"" the narrator continues. \""That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why, when he went to Washington, he got a law passed to fix it. And he did it in his first term. One broadcast station already plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties. And other broadcasters across northern Wisconsin will have the opportunity to offer coverage.\"".\nRescuing thousands of Wisconsinites fans from having to watch Vikings games sounds like the politician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equivalent of returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.\nThere is a phenomenon in broadcasting called \""orphan counties.\"" It occurs when a county in one state is assigned to a local television market in a neighboring state. In 13 northern Wisconsin counties, including Ashland and Iron, according to a broadcast industry blog , the local channels, including the local news, are from stations in either the Minneapolis-St. Paul or Duluth TV markets.\nThat means that if the Packers and Vikings play at the same time on the same network, but not against each other, viewers in the orphan counties are shown the Vikings game, not the Packers game.\nThat occurred six times in the 2015 season and is expected to occur twice in the 2016 season (NFL game times are subject to change), according to the Ashland Daily Press.\nOn those days, viewers in orphan counties can see the Packers games only if they subscribe to a satellite service and pay an additional fee for NFL package.\nSo, Johnson overstates the problem when he says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games. That happens, at most, several times per season. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true that on those days, Wisconsinites in \""orphan counties\"" are shown Vikings games rather than Packers games.\nIn 2014, when Congress reauthorized a satellite television law, a provision was included to address the orphan counties problem. But it requires a petition to be filed and the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.\nJohnson takes credit for the petition provision. And while it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clear he supports the provision, doing so in a December 2015 letter to the FCC, his campaign could not cite evidence that he was responsible for the provision.\nSo, that part of the claim is unclear. But to be fair to Johnson, there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily a formal record on how provisions get inserted into a law.\nJohnson does support the first petition filed under the new provision -- one filed in September 2016 by WSAW-TV in Wausau ( part 1 and part 2 ).\nBut when the ad says one station \""plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties,\"" that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misleading in that WSAW\\xe2\\x80\\x99s petition must get FCC approval.\nThe petition seeks to have satellite providers -- there are two in the United States -- DirecTV and DISH Network -- carry its signal to some orphan county viewers, those in Ashland and Iron counties. That would allow satellite TV subscribers in those areas to see Packers games that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shown there now, without any additional fees.\n\""In a state where the Packers are publicly owned and religiously followed, orphan county viewers feel an affront akin to forcing Washington (Redskins) football fans to watch nothing but Dallas Cowboys,\"" WSAW wrote to the FCC, which is based in Washington, D.C.\nBut the petition applies to only two of the orphan counties. Moreover, DirecTV told Johnson in October 2016 it was technically possible to carry WSAW\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signal to only to four of 11 ZIP codes in Iron County.\nThe FCC told us it has until Feb. 6, 2017 to decide on WSAW\\xe2\\x80\\x99s petition. WDIO-TV in Duluth is objecting to it. The FCC must determine whether granting the petition is in a county\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest and whether it would be economically and technically feasible for satellite providers to carry the WSAW signal. And if it approves the petition, the FCC might order only order one satellite carry to pick up WSAW\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signal, not necessarily both.\n\""Everything in government is slow, but we do think we are very close to a real solution that will give Wisconsinites real change,\"" aide Brooke Ericson told the \\xc2\\xa0 Ashland newspaper in commenting about the WSAW petition. \""Just this petition going to the FCC, I think, is a further step in the right direction. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more than any other senator or congressman for that matter has been able to achieve.\"".\nJohnson says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games, \""they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re forced to watch Viking games,\"" so he \""got a law passed to fix\"" the problem.\nIn some northern parts of the state, viewers in markets served by Minnesota TV stations are not shown some Packers games, whenever they happen to conflict with Vikings broadcasts. But those residents still see the vast majority of Packers games.\nAs for the \""fix,\"" Johnson backs a new provision in federal law that allows for petitions to be filed that, if granted by the Federal Communications Commission, could alleviate the problem in at least some of the so-called orphan counties. But whether that will occur remains to be seen.\nFor a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.\nPresident John F. Kennedy released star Packer Paul Hornung from military reserve duty so he could play in the 1961 NFL Championship Game. True .\nGov.

PolitiFact rated a statement in a similar Trump ad False . Facebook denied Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request.\nWe decided to fact-check Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that unlike Facebook, most TV networks will refuse to air a political campaign ad that contains falsehoods.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWhile the Warren campaign cited a half dozen examples in recent years of TV networks or stations rejecting ads, we found that broadcast networks are generally required to run candidate ads under federal law. The same law doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t apply to cable networks or to PAC ads.\\xc2\\xa0.\nFacebook does have a partnership with third-party fact-checkers -- including PolitiFact -- to debunk viral hoaxes and demote that content. But Facebook exempts politicians from the fact-checking program, stating that it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \""referee political debates\"" or block a politician\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech from an audience.\nChristopher Terry, a University of Minnesota professor of communications and expert on political advertising, said that because Facebook is a private unregulated platform, it can do what it wants.\n\""If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provision of this section.\"".\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBroadcasters are bound by that act and therefore can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reject a presidential candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ad, even if contains false information. (The candidates do have to abide by disclosure rules to make it clear who paid for the ad.).\nEvery election season, some candidates argue that they have been unfairly attacked and that broadcasters should take down ads, wrote David Oxenford, a lawyer who has represented broadcasters for decades and is a partner at Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP.\nHowever, \""broadcasters can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t censor a candidate ad, so they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reject it (or remove it from the air) no matter what its content is,\"" Oxenford wrote.\nThere are caveats.The law does not apply to PACs or independent expenditure ads. And, importantly, the rules for political ads have been interpreted not to apply to cable networks such as CNN. The rules do apply to local cable operators.\\xc2\\xa0.\nCable networks somewhat subscribe to the idea in the act that they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t censor content, but they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bound by it, Terry said.\\xc2\\xa0.\nCNN rejected an ad about Biden and the Ukraine prosecutor. The ad mentioned \""media lapdogs\"" for the Democrats as it showed footage of CNN stars.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe ad disparages CNN and \""makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets,\"" a CNN spokesperson told PolitiFact.\nThat ad was one of a handful of ads the Warren campaign cited as examples of political ads TV or radio rejected in recent years. Multiple stations and Facebook ultimately rejected a Trump ad about a migrant caravan in 2018 that critics said was racist.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWe sent Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examples to Terry, the University of Minnesota professor. He said that Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s examples included issue ads, which aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t covered by the rule.\nThe Warren campaign also cited an FCC website page that states broadcasters should \""act with reasonable care to ensure that advertisements aired on their stations are not false or misleading.\"" However, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the FCC law that bans censorship that truly carries weight.\nWe also found that in May 2017, multiple networks refused to air a Trump ad about his first 100 days that had a \""fake news\"" graphic superimposed over the photos of news anchors. It appeared networks rejected the ad by making a case that Trump didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet meet the legal qualifications of a candidate more than three years before the election.\nWarren said, \""If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s checks.\"".\nThis is a misreading of both federal and actual practice. Federal law requires broadcast networks to run political candidate ads without vetting them for lies or falsehoods. The same law does not apply to cable networks, but those networks also generally aim to run such ads, experts told us.\\xc2\\xa0.\nWarren does have a point that federal law does not apply to online social networks such as Facebook, so Facebook can take candidate ads regardless of whether they include falsehoods.\nBut overall, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inaccurate to say that \""most networks\"" will refuse to air an ad by Trump with a lie in it.

The results of the vote were shared in an SEC filing Wednesday afternoon, after the hearing had wrapped. .\n Starbucks said in its filing that it has a previously announced third-party human rights impact assessment already underway, which includes a \\xe2\\x80\\x9creview of the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Since December 2021 , nearly 300 Starbucks stores have voted to unionize and been certified by the NLRB. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a relatively small number compared to the roughly 9,300 company-operated Starbucks stores in the United States. But union organizers are fighting an uphill battle against the company. .\n Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz arrives to testify about the company\\'s labor and union practices during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, March 29, 2023. .\n NLRB administrative law judge Michael Rosas recently said that Starbucks had displayed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cegregious and widespread misconduct\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in its dealings with employees involved in efforts to unionize Buffalo, New York, stores, including the first location to unionize. Starbucks repeatedly sent high-level executives into Buffalo-area stores in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelentless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d effort, the judge wrote, which \\xe2\\x80\\x9clikely left a lasting impact as to the importance of voting against representation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d As a result, the company must reinstate and make whole a number of workers who were let go from locations in or around Buffalo, Rosas said. The judge also said that Schultz, then interim CEO, and another company leader must read the notice to employees, or be present at a meeting where the rights are read. .\n When Sanders asked whether Schultz would read the notice, Schultz said no. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not, because Starbucks coffee company did not break the law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. .\n Schultz said during his testimony Wednesday that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunequivocally,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Starbucks \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas not broken the law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He referred to Rosas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 findings as \\xe2\\x80\\x9callegations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re confident that those allegations will be proven false.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Starbucks said in a statement at the time of Rosas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 order that it is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsidering all options to obtain further legal review,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe believe the decision and the remedies ordered are inappropriate given the record in this matter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n When Sanders asked Schultz to commit to exchanging proposals with the union within two weeks of the hearing, he declined to do so, saying instead that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will continue to negotiate in good faith.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Starbucks argues that it is the union that has dragged its feet to the bargaining table. Like getting 100 speeding tickets and claiming innocence .\n Later in the morning, Senator Christopher Murphy questioned Schultz on his assertion that Starbucks has been acting legally, saying he was attempting to square Starbucks and Schultz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that it had done nothing wrong with repeated official findings otherwise. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is akin to someone who has been ticketed for speeding 100 times saying I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never violated the law, because every single time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 every single time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the cop got it wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Murphy said. .\n Some senators defended Schultz as a stand-in for business leaders in general. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Schultz, I applaud you for your success. And I applaud all the CEOs out there for their success,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Senator Markwayne Mullin, who a few weeks ago got into a heated exchange with general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Sean O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Brien during another HELP hearing. .\n Senator Mitt Romney threw barbs at his fellow committee members. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s somewhat rich that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being grilled by people who have never had the opportunity to create a single job,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Senator Mitt Romney said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet they believe that they know better how to do so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n In prepared remarks available on a Starbucks (SBUX) \\xe2\\x80\\x99 website, Schultz reiterated his position that while he recognizes that Starbucks (SBUX) workers have a right to decide whether to join a union, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they should. .\n In prepared remarks for the hearing, Schultz said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStarbucks has complied with the National Labor Relations Act,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by recognizing unions after they are certified by the NLRB. .\n Schultz has served three stints as Starbucks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 chief executive, most recently as interim CEO from April 2022 until earlier this month, when he handed over to current CEO Laxman Narasimhan ahead of schedule . In his prepared remarks, Schultz also spoke about the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history, and its character as he sees it. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStarbucks follows its guiding principles, lives its mission and values, celebrates diversity and inclusion, and welcomes all on the belief that our differences make us better and stronger,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are a different kind of public company that balances profitability with social conscience. Aspiring to achieve that vision has been my life\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x98You cannot be pro partner and anti union\\xe2\\x80\\x99 .\n Schultz on Wednesday praised the generous perks and benefits Starbucks offers. He acknowledged in his prepared remarks that when he returned last year it was because the company had \\xe2\\x80\\x9clost its way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but said that it is now back on track. .\n That rosy image of the company, however, has been tainted by the high-profile efforts by Starbucks against the union, which unfolded under Schultz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leadership in 2022 and into this year. .\n Maggie Carter and Jaysin Saxton testify about Starbucks\\' labor and union practices during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions hearing in Washington, DC. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou cannot be pro partner and anti union,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Maggie Carter, a barista and union organizer at a Starbucks in Knoxville, Tennessee, during the hearing. Starbucks uses the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for its employees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well past time for the company to bargain in good faith,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoward Schultz does not feel like a partner to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Carter, who worked at Starbucks through the pandemic, said that when she raised concerns about store conditions to managers during that time they were unresponsive. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was a huge catalyst to why we wanted to organize,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. .\n Jaysin Saxton, a former employee who said he was fired wrongfully, described what he saw as retaliatory behavior from Starbucks after he started organizing. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were disciplined for minor things that happened in the store, like being written up for being two minutes late, which had never happened before,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Saxton said he has filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB and hopes to be reinstated at Starbucks. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are coming came together to demand better pay, affordable health coverage and stronger safety procedures,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m proud to be a leader of this new labor movement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics The Biden Presidency Facts First US Elections Business Markets Tech Media Success Perspectives Videos Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Gadget Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Upstarts Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Formula E Esports Hockey Videos Live TV Digital Studios CNN Films HLN TV Schedule TV Shows A-Z CNNVR Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa 2 Degrees CNN Heroes All Features Weather Climate Storm Tracker Wildfire Tracker Video More Photos Longform Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN .\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

She also writes articles that bring together information from across different financial fields. .\n Michael Boyle is an experienced financial professional with more than 10 years working with financial planning, derivatives, equities, fixed income, project management, and analytics. .\n Bernie Sanders has come a long way from the underdog position he held in 2016, eventually suspending his 2020 campaign for president on April 8, 2020. The Vermont senator was the frontrunner in the Democratic 2020 primary polls, but he eventually lost that lead and the delegate count to former Vice President Joe Biden in early 2020. .\n Sanders espoused many liberal economic policies in his candidacy, including Universal Healthcare and higher taxes on the wealthy and the financial sector. Modern Monetary Theory , the controversial economic theory espoused by his senior economic adviser Stephanie Kelton, has also gained supporters since the last time Sanders ran. .\n Even though Sanders did not win the Democratic primaries this time either, the 78-year-old's name has become synonymous in the U.S. with a movement on the left that has energized scores of progressive young people and dramatically altered how many Americans see their lives and government policy interacting. .\n This is why Sanders' economic agenda deserves attention. Critics who don't \""feel the bern\"" can no longer dismiss him as an angry \""communist\"" with no understanding of American values. His platform has already made ideas like Medicare-for-All mainstream and will no doubt be used by future leaders hoping to take it forward. .\n Sanders says every person in the U.S. is entitled to a decent job and a living wage, quality healthcare, a complete education, affordable housing, a clean environment, and a secure retirement. \""This is the richest country on Earth and we have 40 million in poverty, 34 million with no health insurance, and half our people living paycheck to paycheck,\"" he wrote on Twitter. \""I refuse to accept that as normal.\"" .\n He has called for a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights, referencing the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution guaranteeing civil rights and liberties. Interestingly, President\\xc2\\xa0Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a second Bill of Rights focused on economic security after his 1944 State of the Union speech. Sanders called it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone of the most important speeches ever made by a president\"" in 2015 and added that \""it has not gotten the attention that it deserves.\"" .\n At the center of Sanders\\' campaign was his proposal to give every American health insurance under a government single-payer system . Sanders also wants to lower the price of prescription drugs with three different bills that would allow the government to negotiate prices with Big Pharma, allow patients to import drugs from overseas, and peg prices to the median drug price in Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, and Japan, respectively. .\n About 30 million Americans are currently uninsured, and as Sanders correctly points out, the U.S. spends a much higher amount each year on healthcare than most major countries, as demonstrated in the chart below. .\n He has not provided details on how much this would cost or how it would be paid for. His office had previously released a list of options including introducing a 7.5% income-based premium paid by employers and a 4% income-based premium paid by households. .\n Sanders wants to cancel the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million people. He says this would give graduates the freedom to pursue careers of their choice, narrow the racial wealth divide, and boost the economy by\\xc2\\xa0$1 trillion\\xc2\\xa0over the next 10 years. The $1 trillion figure comes from a paper written by a group of academics, including Kelton. .\n He also wants to cancel all medical debt . His proposal would eliminate an estimated $81 billion in past-due medical debt and reform debt collection practices. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would also be instructed to monitor non-profit hospitals, who have special tax-exempt\u00a0status, to make sure they are using the appropriate billing and collection practices. .\n Sanders, not known for his subtlety, also wants to guarantee higher education as a right for all and would pay for this and cancel student debt by taxing \""Wall Street gambling.\"" (See \""Taxes\"" section) .\n Besides raising the federal minimum wage to at least $15 an hour and doubling union membership, Sanders wants to enact a federal jobs guarantee and work toward a full-employment economy . A job guarantee is actually a proposal borrowed from Modern Monetary Theory. .\n At the time of his running, Sanders said he would be an \""Organizer in Chief,\"" so it's worth mentioning that his Workplace Democracy Plan to reform labor laws and strengthen unions is perhaps one of his most detailed and includes multiple measures. .\n If the concerned bill is passed, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) would certify unions that receive the consent of the majority of eligible workers. Employers would be required to begin negotiating a first union contract within 10 days of the request and those that refuse would face penalties. Sanders wants to also ban mandatory arbitration , non-compete and unilateral modification\u00a0clauses in employment contracts, and establish a sectoral collective bargaining system that is prevalent in Europe. .\n Giving workers ownership stakes in their companies and an equal say in company boards is also part of his agenda. Under his Corporate Accountability and Democracy Plan, private companies with at least $100 million in annual revenue or at least $100 million in balance sheet total and all publicly traded companies would have to be at least 20% owned by employees. \\xc2\\xa0 .\n The employee-owned shares would be placed in a fund controlled by a Board of Trustees directly elected by the workforce. The fund would have voting rights and workers would receive dividends from it. .\n Forty-five percent of the board of directors at these large corporations would also be elected by the workers. Sanders also promises that workers would have the right of first refusal if their company goes on sale or plans to move overseas and will be provided with financial and technical assistance from the U.S. Employee Ownership Bank he would have created. .\n While companies are increasingly opting for outsourcing or automation, if Sanders\\' plan went through, their owners would have to donate shares to U.S. workers laid off due to such transitions. Sanders also wants to stop corporations from sending jobs overseas by eliminating tax deductions, including labor, environmental, and human rights standards, rules against currency cheating in every U.S. trade agreement, and expanding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuy American\\xe2\\x80\\x9d government policies. .\n Sanders has proposed a federal \""tax on extreme wealth.\"" The progressive\\xc2\\xa0wealth tax, which would apply to a net worth of over $32 million, is expected to raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over the next 10 years and cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years. .\n \""One of the biggest sources of wealth for middle-income families is owner-occupied homes, which are taxed in most states at rates that can be as high as, or even higher than, 1%,\"" said the Sanders campaign website. \""Meanwhile, the vast majority of the wealth owned by the top 0.1% of Americans is not housing or real property and is not subject to any sort of property tax. This proposal would ensure that assets owned by the top 0.1% are taxed the same way as much of the wealth owned by the middle-class is already taxed.\"" .\n While still in the running for president, he said he would also pass legislation that establishes a progressive estate tax on the wealth of the top 0.2% and scrap the income limit on Social Security payroll taxes . His administration would also \""end special tax breaks on capital gains and dividends for the top 1% and substantially increase the top marginal tax rate on income above $10 million.\"" .\n Sanders, who successfully pressured Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) to raise its minimum wage to $15, is also proposing progressively higher corporate tax rates for private and public companies whose top executives take home \""exorbitantly\"" higher amounts each year than their typical workers. More specifically, the Income Inequality Tax Plan would penalize companies whose highest-paid executives make over 50 times their median worker pay. It would only apply to corporations that generate annual revenue of over $100 million. .\n Sanders' campaign website said the plan would raise around $150 billion over 10 years if corporations continue to maintain the current level of pay gaps, and the revenue would be used to eliminate medical debt. .\n In addition to this, Sanders says up to $3 trillion in revenue can be collected in 10 years by raising the corporate tax rate back to 35% from 21%, closing corporate tax loopholes, taxing the money corporations earn overseas at the full corporate tax rate, forcing companies with over $25 million to disclose country by country financial information, and removing the 20% tax break for pass-through business income that went into effect in 2018. .\n Large pass-through businesses would also be subject to corporate taxes under his plan. The campaign noted that if this plan had been in effect in 2019, some companies that paid no U.S. federal income taxes, like Amazon, Delta Air Lines Inc. ( DAL ), Chevron Corp. ( CVX ), and General Motors Co. ( GM ), would have owed over $1 billion. .\n The financial transaction tax (FTT) Sanders proposed is a 0.5% tax on stock trades,\u00a0a 0.1% fee on bond trades, and a 0.005% fee on derivatives trades. This is expected to raise $2.4 trillion over 10 years, according to research by left economist Robert Pollin cited by Sanders. Currently, 40 countries have FTTs and the concept goes as far back as the Great Depression. British economist John Maynard Keynes was one of its earliest proponents and suggested in \""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money\"" that the U.S. should introduce \""a substantial government transfer tax on all transactions\"" on Wall Street in order to curb \""the predominance of speculation over enterprise.\"" .\n Sanders\\' campaign didn\\'t have a plan for reforming Wall Street as detailed as Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\'s , but he does want to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act , cap credit card and consumer loans interest rates at 15%, expand basic and affordable banking services offered by post offices, audit the Federal Reserve, reform credit rating agencies, and curb speculation with the tax mentioned earlier. .\n Wall Street asset managers would have to follow investors' instructions or lose their right to vote on shareholder money. He also plans to organize sectoral pension plans that would wield more bargaining power and \""ditch Wall Street asset managers by taking voting in-house.\"" .\n Determined to curb corporate greed and corruption, Sanders wanted to establish a Bureau of Corporate Governance at the Department of Commerce if he had been elected. Large corporations would need to obtain a federal charter forcing their boards to consider the interests of all of the stakeholders, not just shareholders. (He called the August 2019 Business Roundtable commitment to this \""empty words.\"") .\n Besides giving workers more rights (as discussed above), he would also ban large-scale stock buybacks by repealing the SEC\\'s Rule 10B-18 , force corporate boards to include individuals from historically underrepresented groups, protect the rights of farmers and consumers to repair the equipment and technology they purchase, develop guidelines for anti-competitive exclusivity agreements, develop stricter antitrust rules, and allow the Federal Trade Commission to approve, deny, or undo Trump-era mergers. .\n Sanders wants to spend $1.5 trillion over a decade to guarantee every child in America below the age of three free full-day, full-week, high-quality childcare, and children above three, free universal pre-kindergarten. \\xc2\\xa0 .\n Sanders also promised to double the funding for The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, give childcare workers a living wage, pass a bill to ensure\\xc2\\xa0free meals to every child in childcare and pre-k, construct, renovate, or rehabilitate childcare facilities and pre-schools, and make more investments in the public education system. .\n This is the biggest proposal yet for an issue that most of the Democratic candidates during the primaries considered important not just for individual families but for the U.S. economy as a whole. \\xc2\\xa0Sanders said he would pay for it with the taxes on extreme wealth. .\n Sanders has his own version of a Green New Deal . The goal of the plan is to reach 100% renewable energy for electricity and transportation by 2030 and complete decarbonization by 2050 at the latest. .\n It involves a $16.3 trillion public investment and the creation of 20 million \""good-paying, union jobs with strong benefits and safety standards\"" in steel and auto manufacturing, construction, energy efficiency retrofitting, coding and server farms, renewable power plants, and sustainable agriculture. .\n Sanders also promised to ban fracking and mountaintop removal coal mining. He said he would promote electric vehicles with $2.09 trillion in grants for families and $85.6 billion on a national electric vehicle charging infrastructure. .\n Of the $3 trillion raised from corporate taxes in 10 years, $2 trillion would be devoted to the Green New Deal. The campaign website also added the plan would basically pay for itself. Sanders would target the fossil fuel industry with litigation, fees, taxes, and eliminating federal fossil fuel subsidies. He also says there will be cuts in military spending since the U.S. would not be fighting expensive wars to protect its access to oil abroad, and an increase in tax revenue and decrease in safety net spending due to the new jobs created. .\n In 2015, Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced the first standalone bill to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and make it legal. Sanders, who believes the current law disproportionately targets African Americans, was also the first high-profile 2016 presidential candidate to call for marijuana legalization on the federal level. .\n If he had been elected, he had promised to issue an executive order to declassify marijuana as a controlled substance and introduce legislation to make it permanent. His plan has two parts: (1) undo the damage of the war on marijuana and (2) regulate the legal marijuana industry with strict laws to prevent it from becoming like Big Tobacco. .\n His administration would have reviewed and expunged all current and past marijuana-related convictions and devoted funding and manpower to make sure no one slips through the cracks. Tax revenue collected from the marijuana industry would go toward helping communities impacted by marijuana convictions. .\n According to his plan, market share and franchise caps would be introduced to \""prevent consolidation and profiteering\"" in the industry. Businesses would be incentivized to be structured like cooperatives and collective nonprofits. Tobacco companies would be prevented from participating in the industry. This would spell trouble for giants hoping to diversify their businesses, like Marlboro-maker Altria Group Inc. ( MO ), which bought almost half of Canada-based Cronos Group Inc. ( CRON ) in 2018. .\n Safety measures proposed include a ban on marketing products to young people and barring companies that run misleading advertisements or create products that cause cancer from the industry. .\n Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Phil Scott speaks during a debate against Christine Hallquist, the Democratic candidate for governor, at the Paramount Theatre in downtown Rutland on Oct. 10. Photo by Bob LoCicero for VTDigger .\nThe Department of Health estimates about 8,000 people in the state are in treatment for opioid use disorder. The state has had wait times for treatment off and on for more than five years and has struggled to ensure that professionals can meet the demand.\n\""We had a waiting list (for drug treatment) in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700,\"" Scott said at a gubernatorial debate in Rutland last month. \""We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero.\"".\nWe asked the campaign for evidence to back up the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims, but we never heard back. The Vermont Department of Health, however, closely tracks waitlists at the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s six \""hubs,\"" the regional centers where people addicted to opioids can get high-intensity medication-assisted treatment.\nState data indicates the governor is off on the original waitlist number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by several hundred. In January 2017, when Scott took office, there were 145 people on hub waitlists statewide, and only 134 on the waitlist for the Chittenden hub.\nHubs are the lynchpin of Vermont\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hub-and-spoke drug treatment model. Drug treatment is typically initiated at hubs, where people suffering from opioid abuse disorder can get daily doses of their medication, along with counseling and referrals to social services. Less intensive services are provided at so-called \""spokes,\"" a collection of about 90 providers made up of doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offices and community clinics, where patients can get follow-up care.\nThe numbers tracked by the state do show a precipitous decline in waitlists at hubs since 2017. In fact, in 2018, there were no waitlists for treatment at any hubs in March, May, June, July and August, the last month for which data is available.\nIn Chittenden County, the state hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t counted a single person on a waitlist at the Howard Center\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chittenden Clinic, the regional hub for Chittenden and Addison counties, from September 2017 to August 2018, except for one blip in April 2018, when two people were on the waitlist.\nDana Poverman, the director of Medication Assisted Treatment at the Howard Center Chittenden Clinic, said the number on the waitlist is still zero.\n\""We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve really come a long way in terms of access to medicine-assisted treatment,\"" she said. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thanks in large part, Poverman said, to the opening of the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sixth hub in St. Albans and a dramatic increase in spoke providers.\nLess is known about what waitlists look like at Vermont\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spokes.

Greg Abbott tweeted on Oct. 1: \""Property crime rising in Austin This is the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police. Residents are left to fend for themselves.\"".\nThe tweet cited a KVUE article that highlighted an advisory from the Austin Police Department warning residents to secure their homes before going on a trip. The article noted 2,983 burglaries had occurred through the first eight months of this year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an 11% increase over the first eight months of last year, according to the Austin Police Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s August crime report.\nBut burglary is not the only form of property crime, and Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion that property crime is rising in Austin fails to take that into account.\nProperty crime generally has been falling in Austin, with the notable recent exceptions of 2018 and 2019. So far this year, property crime has dropped slightly. And Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt to link crime to the City Council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budget decision misses the mark.\nIn August, Abbott claimed that crime is on the rise in Austin, citing data that showed a jump in homicides over the first six months of the year. We rated that claim Half True .\nEach month, the Austin Police Department posts to its website the Chief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Monthly Report, which tallies the number and category of crimes officers respond to each month. The 2,983 burglaries cited in the KVUE article comprise 9% of all property crimes recorded through August. Other crimes that fall into this category include shoplifting, credit card fraud, embezzlement and vandalism.\nAustin police responded to nearly 34,000 total property crimes through August, which is a 2% drop compared with 2019. According to FBI data, property crime in Austin increased in 2018 by 8.5% and in 2019 by 8.7%.\nBut taking a longer view, the property crime rate has generally been falling over the last decade. In addition to 2018 and 2019, the only other year since 2010 when the rate did not drop compared to the previous year was in 2012.\nIn 2010 Austin police responded to nearly 46,000 reports of property crime, or about 5.8 incidents per 100 residents, according to federal data. In 2019, officers responded to 36,588 reports, or about 3.7 incidents per 100 residents. Burglaries specifically also have been dropping, from about 1.1 incidents per 100 residents in 2010 to about 0.4 in 2019.\nAbbott is not the only Texas elected official who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rebuked Austin leaders for cutting the Austin police budget. Several other Republicans have seized on Austin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s police spending as an issue in their reelection campaigns.\nThe perception of high crime in Austin reflects a popular misconception that crime is always on the rise despite a general downward trend, said Texas State University criminologist Sean Roche. On average, crime in the U.S. has declined since the mid-1990s to historically low and stable levels.\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generally true for Austin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property crime rates as well. Federal data going back to 1985 show a peak of property crime incidents in 1990 followed by a decade of low property crime until a smaller peak in 2009.\n\""Even though crime went up in the 60s, 70s and 80s and then started declining in the 90s, most of the public did not ever catch wise of this,\"" Roche said. \""There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a significant chunk of people in the U.S. that always think crime is getting worse.\"".\nSome researchers have suggested that a false perception of high crime may be attributable to a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s level of media exposure, especially local TV news. A study published in 2018 by Roche and colleagues note that this misperception may have significant implications for criminal justice policies, which are \""particularly sensitive to public opinion\"" compared to other policy domains.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n\""Over-concern about crime is likely to mobilize the public to be more punitive, thereby fueling support for increased law enforcement spending and harsh sentencing policies,\"" Roche and his coauthors wrote. \""Public punitiveness is one of the strongest predictors of both federal and state incarceration rates.\"".\nAfter asserting that the property crime rate in Austin is rising, Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet goes on to claim that rising crime is \""the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police.\"".\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear what the governor means when he says \""deemphasize police\"" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but we can be sure what city he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s referring to when talking about defunding. The Austin City Council recently decided to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shifted another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments to continue civilian-run functions, such as the 911 call center and forensics.\nThe cuts came after protests against police brutality in Austin and across the nation demanded police reforms in the wake of George Floyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death in Minneapolis police custody in May.\nBut how the council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budgetary decisions will affect the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daily operations, especially in regard to property crime, is not yet known.\n\""In terms of staffing changes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still working on,\"" said Austin police spokeswoman Tara Long. \""We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still working on those specifics.\"".\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley indicated in August that the department may reduce or eliminate about a dozen police units while reassigning those officers to patrol duties. The cuts also will cancel three upcoming cadet classes and reduce overtime spending.\nBut does a smaller police force automatically heighten crime? Research would suggest that there is a weak or nonexistent connection between the two. One systematic review by criminologists at the University of Cincinnati concludes that the overall effect of police force size on crime is \""statistically not significant,\"" although it is possible that force size might influence some crimes more than others.\n\""Policy makers who want police to have an impact on crime would be better suited investing resources in new evidence-based strategies than funding surges in police hiring,\"" the 2016 review says.\nRather, crime trends are more influenced by macro-level drivers, like the prevalence of firearms in a community, alcohol consumption, drug use, unemployment and a population\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age structure, Roche said.\n\""Austin, on average, has historically been a very safe city,\"" he said. \""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premature to say definitively that a budget decision that was made a couple months ago has already had these very dramatic impacts on crime rates. We just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\"".\nAbbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet made two factual claims: that property crime in Austin is on the rise and that this increase is causally linked to the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s police budget cuts.\nHe based the first on figures presented in a KVUE article that cited an 11% increase in burglaries so far this year. However, property crime on the whole is not rising this year. In fact, it has dropped by 2% compared to last year. Although property crime increased slightly in 2018 and 2019, property crime has dropped significantly over the past decade.\nThe article Abbott referenced also cited data that showed crime rates as of August, which is before cuts to APD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budget took effect on Oct. 1.\nThe second part of his claim, that increased property crime is \""the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police,\"" appears to be based on assumption. Researchers have demonstrated how numerous intervening factors confound the relationship between police force size and crime.

Gov. Greg Abbott speaks at a news conference before signing a \""Texas Backs the Blue Pledge\"" at the Austin Police Association on Thursday Sept. 10, 2020, in Austin, Texas. ( Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP) Jay Janner, MBR / Associated Press.\nThe claim: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProperty crime rising in Austin. This is the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police. Residents are left to fend for themselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nAbbott made the statement on Twitter on Oct. 1 as part of his sustained campaign to criticize the Austin City Council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to cut funding to its police department.\nPolitiFact ruling: Mostly False. Total property crimes have actually dropped 2 percent in the city, compared with last year. And researchers have demonstrated that the size of police forces is not directly related to crime. Discussion .\nThe tweet cited an advisory from the Austin Police Department warning residents to secure their homes before going on a trip. The article noted 2,983 burglaries had occurred through the first eight months of this year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 an 11-percent increase over the first eight months of last year, according to the Austin Police Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s August crime report. .\nBut burglary is not the only form of property crime, and Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion that property crime is rising in Austin fails to take that into account. .\nProperty crime generally has been falling in Austin, with the notable recent exceptions of 2018 and 2019. So far this year, property crime has dropped slightly. And Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt to link crime to the City Council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budget decision misses the mark. .\nEach month, the Austin Police Department posts to its website the Chief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Monthly Report, which tallies the number and category of crimes officers respond to each month. The 2,983 burglaries cited in Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet comprise 9 percent of all property crimes recorded through August. Other crimes that fall into this category include shoplifting, credit card fraud, embezzlement and vandalism. .\nAustin police responded to nearly 34,000 total property crimes through August, which is a 2 percent drop compared with 2019. According to FBI data, property crime in Austin increased in 2018 by 8.5 percent and in 2019 by 8.7 percent. .\nBut taking a longer view, the property crime rate has generally been falling over the last decade. The number of property crimes has only risen in a total of three years since 2010. .\nIn 2010, Austin police responded to nearly 46,000 reports of property crime, or about 5.8 incidents per 100 residents, according to federal data. In 2019, officers responded to 36,588 reports, or about 3.7 incidents per 100 residents. Burglaries specifically also have been dropping, from about 1.1 incidents per 100 residents in 2010 to about 0.4 in 2019. .\nThe perception of high crime in Austin reflects a popular misconception that crime is always on the rise despite a general downward trend, said Texas State University criminologist Sean Roche. On average, crime in the U.S. has declined since the mid-1990s to historically low and stable levels. .\nPolitiFact is a fact-checking project to help you sort out fact from fiction in politics.

See More Collapse .\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generally true for Austin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property crime rates as well. Federal data going back to 1985 show a peak of property crime incidents in 1990 followed by a decade of low property crime until a smaller peak in 2009. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEven though crime went up in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9960s, \\xe2\\x80\\x9970s and \\xe2\\x80\\x9980s and then started declining in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9990s, most of the public did not ever catch wise of this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Roche said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a significant chunk of people in the U.S. that always think crime is getting worse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nAfter asserting that the property crime rate in Austin is rising, Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tweet goes on to claim that rising crime is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear what the governor means when he says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeemphasize police\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Austin City Council recently decided to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shifted another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments to continue civilian-run functions, such as the 911 call center and forensics. .\nThe cuts came after protesters against police brutality in Austin and across the nation demanded police reforms in the wake of George Floyd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death in Minneapolis police custody in May. .\nBut how the council\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budgetary decisions will affect the department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daily operations, especially in regard to property crime, is not yet known. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn terms of staffing changes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still working on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Austin police spokeswoman Tara Long. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still working on those specifics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley indicated in August that the department may reduce or eliminate about a dozen police units while reassigning those officers to patrol duties. The cuts also will cancel three upcoming cadet classes and reduce overtime spending. .\nBut does a smaller police force automatically heighten crime? One systematic review by criminologists at the University of Cincinnati concludes that the overall effect of police force size on crime is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstatistically not significant,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d although it is possible that force size might influence some crimes more than others. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPolicy makers who want police to have an impact on crime would be better suited investing resources in new evidence-based strategies than funding surges in police hiring,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the 2016 review says. .\nRather, crime trends are more influenced by macro-level drivers, like the prevalence of firearms in a community, alcohol consumption, drug use, unemployment and a population\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age structure, Roche said. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAustin, on average, has historically been a very safe city,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s premature to say definitively that a budget decision that was made a couple months ago has already had these very dramatic impacts on crime rates.

Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all have pleaded not guilty to the federal charges . .\n A fourth former officer, Derek Chauvin, pleaded guilty last month to related federal charges of violating Floyd\\'s civil rights. Chauvin already is serving more than 20 years after his conviction on state charges for the murder of Floyd in police custody. .\n Then-officers Lane and Kueng were first to respond on May 25, 2020, to a 911 call reporting that a customer, later identified as Floyd, had tried to use an allegedly counterfeit $20 bill at a corner Minneapolis market. .\n They located Floyd in the driver's seat of a parked SUV. After they approached and handcuffed him, the officers tried to force Floyd into the back of a police car, to which Floyd protested, saying he was claustrophobic. .\n Chauvin arrived and put Floyd on the pavement, where Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd repeatedly told him \""I can't breathe\"" and became unresponsive. .\n According to the federal indictment , \""Thao and Kueng willfully failed to intervene to stop Chauvin\\'s use of unreasonable force, resulting in bodily injury to, and the death of, Mr. Floyd.\"" .\n The indictment further alleges that all four officers observed Floyd \""in clear need of medical care and willfully failed to aid him,\"" and that by doing so, they \""willfully deprived\"" Floyd of his federal civil rights \""to be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs,\"" resulting in Floyd's death. .\n Chauvin's guilty plea in December to the federal charges averted a second trial for him after his high-profile conviction for second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter of Floyd. He has not yet been sentenced on the federal charges, but could face additional prison time. .\n Chauvin, 45, was sentenced in June to 22.5 years in prison \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or 270 months \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for killing Floyd, a Black man whose death caught on viral video sparked the nation\\'s largest civil rights protests in decades along with continuing conversations about police brutality and racial injustice. .\n Federal prosecutors independently charged Chauvin with multiple federal civil rights violations in two cases \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one involving Floyd, and another involving a then 14-year-old in a 2017 case. In both instances, Chauvin held his knee on the neck of the victim in police custody, displaying what the federal charges alleged was \""unreasonable force by a police officer.\"" .\n Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Here is a look at some of those cases: Botham Jean.\nOne of the more bizarre police-involved shootings occurred in September 2018 when Dallas police officer Amber Guyger entered a Black man\u2019s apartment and fatally shot him.\nAlthough Guyger wasn\u2019t on duty when she killed Botham Jean, she had just finished her shift for the Dallas Police Department and was still in uniform.\nGuyger, who lived in the same apartment complex,\u00a0testified that she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own\u00a0and thought he was an intruder. Guyger was sentenced to 10 years in prison after a jury found her guilty of murder. Damon Grimes.\nA teenager riding an all-terrain vehicle crashed and died in August 2017 after a Michigan state trooper fired his Taser at him during a police chase.\nThe trooper, Mark Bessner, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to five to 15 years in prison in 2019 , nearly two years after the fatal incident .\nBessner and another state police officer\u00a0were chasing Damon Grimes, 15, who was riding an ATV in a Detroit neighborhood. Bessner, who was in the passenger seat of the police vehicle, pulled out his Taser and fired it at Grimes.\nThe teenager crashed into the back of a parked truck and flew off the ATV. He died a short time later from his injuries. Laquan McDonald.\nChicago police officer Jason Van Dyke shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times in October 2014 as he walked away from police while holding a knife.\nVan Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm, one for each shot fired at the Black teenager. Van Dyke was sentenced to 6\u00be years in prison.\nAfter public outcry over the length of the prison term, the Illinois state attorney general pushed to get Van Dyke a stiffer sentence. The Illinois Supreme Court voted against ordering a new sentence. Van Dyke is scheduled to be released from prison next year. Walter Scott.\nWalter Scott, 50, an unarmed Black man, was shot repeatedly in the back as he ran away from an officer in April 2015. With both feet planted on the ground, the officer fired eight shots, hitting Scott five times.\nThe fatal encounter began as a routine traffic stop. Michael Slager, 33, a\u00a0North Charleston, South Carolina\u00a0police officer, stopped Scott for a broken brake light.\nScott fled the car, and when Slager caught up to him, the two struggled over the officer\\'s Taser. Scott broke free from the skirmish.\u00a0A bystander\\'s cellphone video captured what happened next \u2013 an unarmed Black man running away from an officer as a barrage of bullets were fired into his back.\nSlager was tried on a charge of murder in state court in 2016. A mistrial was declared after the jury could not reach a unanimous decision. Slager pleaded guilty to a single federal civil rights charge, which avoided another trial and left his sentencing to a judge.\nJudge David Norton concluded Slager committed murder, saying he \""acted out of malice and forethought, shooting dead an unarmed and fleeing Walter Scott.\"".\n\""Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that,\"" he said. \""I wish this never would have happened.\"" Berry Lawson.\nOn March 26, 1938, three policemen approached a young African American waiter sleeping in the lobby of the hotel where he worked.

It did not have to prove that he actually killed anyone in seeking his conviction for capital murder.\nThe Death Penalty Information Center estimates that of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1,458 executions between 1985 and 2018, 11 involved cases in which the defendant neither arranged nor committed murder. Even rarer are cases in which the person was unarmed and uninvolved in a violent act, such as a robbery \\xe2\\x80\\x94 cases like that of Mr. Woods, whose defenders say he had no foreknowledge of the violence to unfold and fled in terror as the bullets flew.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNathaniel Woods is 100% innocent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d another death-row inmate, Kerry Spencer, wrote in a letter in support of Mr. Woods. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know this to be a fact because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the man that shot and killed all three of the officers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nMr. Woods \\xe2\\x80\\x94 whose case is the subject of a new documentary by The New York Times, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo Live and Die in Alabama\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x94 was a Black man living in the Black-majority city of Birmingham. But only two of the dozen jurors hearing his case were Black. The judge and the two prosecutors were white, as were the three victims.\nHe was also a Black man living in Alabama, a state with a history of racial injustice and a full embrace of capital punishment. It has the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest number of death-row inmates per capita and is the only state that does not require jury unanimity in recommending death.\nIn the annals of capital punishment, Mr. Woods is not the most sympathetic figure: a drug dealer whose evasive actions led to three deaths; who taunted one of the widows in a letter; who refused to show compassion, even at his sentencing. Still, just as jurors struggled with reading Mr. Woods\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impassive facial expression, so too does the law struggle with measures of punishment. How could it be that the armed man who killed three officers continues to live, while the unarmed man who fled dies?.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tragedy is that people like Nathaniel Woods become victims of our indifference to injustice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights organization based in Alabama. He added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeing in the wrong place at the wrong time doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make you someone who is evil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nDark-bearded but still boyish, his slight frame dressed in his death-row whites, the condemned man looked back at his family. Then he disappeared behind a door held open just for him.\nHeavenly Woods, one of his sisters, said she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get that last look out of her mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just stuck,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just, you know, just: What was he thinking?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nOn a hot afternoon getting hotter by the second, all that separated the hostility between Nathaniel Woods, drug dealer, and Carlos Owen, police officer, was a back screen door.\nTheir fraught standoff on June 17, 2004, was unfolding at a one-story, bare-bones apartment in the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ensley section. The surrounding empty lots and vacant storefronts told the familiar American story of steel and prosperity moving out and drugs and crime moving in.\nMr. Woods was a clerk in a 24-hour drug operation run by his cousin Tyran Cooper, who went by Bubba. His job: Collect the money and hand over the drugs.\nMr. Woods spent his early childhood in Tuscaloosa, nursing stray animals and teasing his younger sisters, Heavenly and Pamela, who still call him by his nickname Quail. But they say the familial mirth all but ended when their parents split up, partly because their mother used beatings to keep them in line.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI told the police if I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t whoop their ass, then they need to take them to jail or take me, because ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t no child going to run my house when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting up and going to work two jobs taking care of them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d their mother, also named Pamela Woods, said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd all I get is, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You mean, you hateful, you abuse us.\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\nMr. Woods left school after the sixth grade and eventually moved to Birmingham to live with his father, Nathaniel Woods Sr. He developed a knack for electronics, able to revive a dead television, as well as a knack for trouble, with arrests for burglary, reckless driving and public drinking.\nHe got a job driving a forklift at a Piggly Wiggly warehouse, where his father was a foreman, but it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stick. Now he was 28, with three young children and a job selling drugs in an operation taking in $3,000 a day.\nHis work partner and friend Kerry Spencer, 23, had followed a similar path. He, too, had left school, had worked at the Piggly Wiggly warehouse and had young children. But he was also snorting $350 worth of cocaine a day, and was usually armed.\nThis wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t warehouse work, after all. Just two months earlier, in April 2004, their boss, Mr. Cooper, had helped set a Birmingham corner aglow with gunfire during a dispute that left two people wounded. He was arrested a short while later in his bullet-riddled white Buick.\nFor all the drugs and bullets, life at the 18th Street apartment passed without police interruption, Mr. Spencer would later testify. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEveryone around us was getting busted, but we never got touched,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would say.\nOfficer Carlos Owen, 58, was a Birmingham Police Department fixture assigned to patrol the Ensley streets he knew so well. Though he was a graying grandfather with plans to retire in two years, everyone called him by a nickname based on an old hairstyle: Curly.\nIn his 26 years on the job, he had been shot at three times, bitten by a dog once and involved in too many chases to remember. He had led the police union and been repeatedly honored for his police work, including as Officer of the Year in 2002.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe epitomized the community policing idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill Lowe, an Ensley business owner, would later tell The Birmingham News. He added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe knew where the good guys were and where the bad guys were.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was good to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Lou Lou Chatman, 60, a self-described former drug dealer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA couple of times he could have took me to jail. And even if he had to take you to jail, he would pull over and let you get rid of everything on you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nLooming beside Officer Owen at the back door was Officer Harley Chisholm III, a few days short of his 41st birthday. His on-the-job enthusiasm, coupled with his six-foot-four frame and wraparound sunglasses, had earned the six-year police veteran and former Marine a nickname of his own: RoboCop.\nOfficer Carlos Owen was a Birmingham Police Department fixture assigned to patrol the Ensley streets he knew so well. Credit... Matt Kay and Victor Tadashi Suarez.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe knew when to police from the book and police from his heart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one of his sisters, Starr Chisholm Sidelinker, wrote to The New York Times. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe chose to work in one of the bad-ass areas to help make it a better place for the community.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nOfficer Chisholm had been both honored and disciplined for his police work. In 2002, a year after being named the West Precinct\\xe2\\x80\\x99s officer of the year, he was suspended after admitting to opening a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s car trunk, dousing some baby clothes with beer from bottles he had broken, and destroying a television set in the vehicle with a knife.\nCurly and RoboCop, the patrolling guardians of Ensley. Some in the neighborhood respected them, some feared them, and some \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including Mr. Woods\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employer and cousin, Bubba Cooper \\xe2\\x80\\x94 considered them corrupt.\nIn a 2012 affidavit, and again in an interview this summer with The Times, Mr. Cooper claimed to have paid protection money to Officers Owen and Chisholm for years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 with weekly payoffs of as much as $1,000 usually made at a local steakhouse called Niki\\xe2\\x80\\x99s West. In return, he said, they suppressed local competition and tipped him off to the buy-and-bust operations of narcotics officers.\nBut Mr. Cooper said that after he was arrested on attempted murder charges \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in connection with that shooting spree in April 2004 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the two officers raised their price to $3,000 a week. At that point, he said, he stopped paying them for protection.\nOthers who lived in Ensley, including some involved in the drug trade at the time, told similar stories about the two officers. But neither man was ever formally accused of corruption, according to Annetta Nunn, the police chief at the time.\nMr. Owen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, Andrea Elders, dismissed the allegations against her father \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who, she said, used to deliver bicycles to disadvantaged children in Ensley \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as untruths concocted after his death by local criminals.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, he was a crooked cop,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ms. Elders said with derision. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Twenty-six years on the police force, he was not a crooked cop. You would think if he was, it would have come out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A burst of violence.\nThe screen-door standoff was the culmination of escalating tensions that day at the 18th Street apartment. There had already been one previous encounter, if not two.\nMr. Spencer and Mr. Woods later claimed that Officer Owen first appeared at the apartment around dawn, pulling up in his truck on his way to the West Precinct building a half-mile away. Police records indicate that he reported to work at 6:30 that morning.\nBut this account could not be verified, and another witness later testified that neither Mr. Woods nor Mr. Spencer was at the apartment early that morning, though she said someone later told her that Officer Owen had indeed stopped by.\nThere is no question that Officers Owen and Chisholm arrived at the apartment around 10:30 that morning \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to check on stolen cars, they said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that they got into a heated argument with Mr. Woods and Mr. Spencer.\nThe two sides swapped obscenities and threats that centered on hiding behind a badge and hiding behind a door. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a friendly conversation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Spencer later testified.\nAt some point, Officer Owen briefly removed his badge. At some point, Mr. Woods gave his name because, his defenders say, he believed he had done nothing wrong.\nBefore the officers left the scene, they used the patrol-car computer of Officer Michael Collins, who had arrived in the midst of the confrontation, to run Mr. Woods\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name through criminal databases. The drug dealers, meanwhile, began hiding their paraphernalia \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in anticipation.\nMr. Spencer said that he then took a pill, drank a Bud Lite and went to sleep. Beside him: a semiautomatic rifle he had recently acquired in exchange for $35, a handgun and a half-gram of cocaine.\nLess than three hours later, the police received confirmation by phone that Mr. Woods was wanted in nearby Fairfield on a misdemeanor assault charge related to a four-month-old domestic disturbance - eliciting a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWoohoo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from Officer Chisholm. This time, four police officers pulled up to the 18th Street apartment: Mr. Owen, Mr. Chisholm, Mr. Collins and Charles Robert Bennett.\nNow Officer Owen was at the back door again, telling Mr. Woods through the screen that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest and to come outside. Mr. Woods profanely refused.\nWhen Officer Chisholm was summoned from the front yard to confirm the warrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existence, Officer Collins later said, Mr. Woods cursed again and ran deeper into the small apartment, where the covered windows cast the drug-house clutter in eternal dusk. Officer Chisholm rushed in after him, followed by Officers Owen and Collins.\nSome of what happened next is in dispute: whether the police used pepper spray; whether the police drew their guns. But there is no doubt of the sudden explosion of violence that followed, detailed by Mr. Spencer in a cellphone video recorded from death row last year.\nHe said that he woke up to commotion, looked out a window to see a police car and then saw Mr. Woods stumbling out of the kitchen, holding his face as if in pain \\xe2\\x80\\x94 perhaps from pepper spray. Then, seeing movement, he opened fire with his semiautomatic, killing Officers Chisholm and Owen. One bullet nicked Officer Collins as he fled out the back door.\nThen Officer Bennett \\xe2\\x80\\x94 33 and married, with a 4-year-old daughter \\xe2\\x80\\x94 came through the front door and, Mr. Spencer said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hit him like three times.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAmid the gunfire, Mr. Woods scrambled out the bathroom window and started to flee, passing Officer Bennett lying on the ground. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Uh, I been hit,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Woods told the police. But he kept running.\nMr. Spencer said he went to the back door and sprayed a patrol car with bullets to scare off Officer Collins. As he ran out the front door, he sensed that the gravely wounded Officer Bennett was trying to grab his leg. He shot him in the head.\nAn anxious but determined manhunt followed, with crouched officers searching alleys and houses with guns drawn. Mr. Woods watched the activity while sitting on a porch diagonally across from the apartment, as if the drama had nothing to do with him. He surrendered when identified, convinced that he would be fine because he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t killed anyone.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t shoot no police officer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would say while being interrogated later that day. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAin\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do nothing like that. That ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, that ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nWreaths at the entrance of a police station in Birmingham, Ala., in memory of Officer Owen, Officer Chisholm and Officer Bennett.

It depicts in bas-relief the likeness of three police officers killed in the line of duty. Carlos Owen, grandfather. Harley Chisholm III, former Marine.

It just brings that memory back, seeing his eyes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe gunman, Kerry Spencer, was convicted first. In presenting a case of self-defense, his lawyer, Michael Blalock, apparently raised enough doubt about what the police were doing at the apartment that the jury recommended life without parole, rather than the death penalty.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on that shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be going on, bottom line,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Blalock said in an interview. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I think the jurors picked up on it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBut Alabama at that time allowed judges to overrule jury recommendations \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which Judge Tommy Nail of the Jefferson County Circuit Court did by sentencing Mr. Spencer to death. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay God have mercy on your soul,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the judge said.\nA month later, in October 2005, Mr. Woods stood trial on the same capital murder charges for which Mr. Spencer had just been convicted.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost people think that you can only get the death penalty for murders that you are responsible for, in the sense that you committed the killing or you paid somebody to commit the killing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. But he said that the Supreme Court permitted a person to be sentenced to death \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you had \\xe2\\x80\\x98reckless disregard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for the life of the victim and were a major participant in the underlying felony.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nStill, Mr. Woods\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawyers had confidence in their case. He never fired a shot, he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a gun and even the shooter, Mr. Spencer, said Mr. Woods had nothing to do with the killings.\nTrue, Mr. Woods had talked trash about the police and had challenged Officer Owen to a fight. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMakes him guilty of having a big mouth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his lawyer, Cynthia Umstead, told the jury. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMakes him guilty of stupidity for saying that. Does not make him guilty of capital murder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBut prosecutors challenged the premise that the shooting was unplanned by portraying Mr. Woods as a police-hating criminal who had purposely led the officers to their deaths in the tight apartment.\nMr. Woods watching as the jury entered the courtroom during his murder trial in 2005.

And, under the law, he was just as culpable for their deaths as the gunman.\nThroughout, Mr. Woods\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flat expression invited interpretation. At least one white juror believed that the defendant tried to intimidate the jury with his stare.

According to Giuliani , it showed workers counting ballots that had been brought in and hidden under a table until after poll watchers had left. Chief investigator Frances Watson disputed this, claiming that, according to her\u00a0findings, this did not take place.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur investigation and review of the entire security footage revealed that there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables as has been reported by some,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Watson said in an affidavit.\nWatson said her\u00a0probe began after people complained on Election Day that Fulton County staff told clerks, media, and public observers to leave the arena due to a water leak, while vote counters kept tallying ballots.\nThe leak turned out to be a urinal that overflowed earlier that day, Watson said. She claimed that, according to her\u00a0investigation, which included viewing footage and interviewing witnesses, no one asked media or observers to leave.\n\""They simply left on their own when they saw one group of workers, whose job was only to open envelopes and who had completed that task, also leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Watson said.\nWatson also stated that the table under which ballots had allegedly been hidden did not have anything underneath it when it was set up the morning of November 3. She said that at approximately 10 p.m. that night, ballots that had been opened but not counted were sealed in boxes that were placed under the table while observers and media were present.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was done because employees thought that they were done for the night and were closing up and ready to leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Watson said, adding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe counting continued into later in the night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that the boxes were then opened so those ballots could be counted.\nWatson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affidavit does not address why workers thought the counting was done or why it later continued.

Multiple media reports from election night indicate poll watchers were told to go home, multiple poll watchers have signed affidavits to that effect \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Fulton county public affairs manager Regina Fulton said on election night that poll watchers at the arena had been sent home, although she now denies they were.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have launched an investigation into why the monitors from the political parties left before scanning ended,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a spokesperson from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office said in a statement to National Review . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhile it was their right to leave early, we want to make certain they were not misled into thinking scanning had stopped for the night when it had not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nRaffensperger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spokesperson added that the secretary of state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office has not encountered any evidence suggesting any improper ballots were scanned, either from the investigation or the independent monitor. The spokesperson also emphasized that the ballots were held in their proper containers the entire time and were not placed in \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuitcases\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the Trump campaign initially suggested.\nAlso unclear is who made the initial call, eventually overturned, that poll workers could wrap up their work for the night. A spokesperson for the secretary of state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office said they were not aware of who made that decision.\nSterling said that as Raffensperger was leaving for the day he heard that Fulton County ballot counters were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknocking off for the day, and he was understandably not happy with that and made that very clear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nRaffensperger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office then called the Fulton County elections director Rick Barron, who was not at State Farm Arena, and asked why his county was putting vote-counting to bed for the night. Barron was apparently confused and said they were not stopping yet, at which point the secretary of state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office informed him that ballot counters at State Farm Arena were preparing to go home.\nIn the video, Fulton County Registration Chief Ralph Jones can be seen receiving a phone call from Barron informing him that poll workers must stay longer and keep counting votes, according to Sterling. At that point, the workers start pulling the ballot boxes back out from under the table, where they had just stored them, to continue scanning ballots.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really frustrating is the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorneys had this same videotape.

The events caught on the security footage also happened 17 hours apart from the water leak incident.

The video itself doesn\u2019t prove this claim.\nOfficials said that there was never an instruction for observers to leave, and that there were no suitcases\u00a0full of ballots. The bins in the video were standard ballot containers, and the footage shows what officials described as the normal tabulation process. .\nGeorgia election officials disputed a video promoted by President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign as evidence of election fraud, saying the footage shows nothing but \""normal ballot processing.\"".\nThe surveillance video was introduced as proof of illegal activity by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his team during a Dec. 3 hearing with Georgia state legislators. The Trump campaign then circulated One America News Network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s live coverage of the event online.\nSocial media posts sharing the video were flagged as part of Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .).\nThe posts claim the video footage shows election workers at Atlanta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s State Farm Arena telling election observers to leave, pulling suitcases filled with ballots from under a table, and illegally counting them with no observers present. \""Smoking gun,\"" one Facebook post said.\nThat interpretation is wrong, however. The footage doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show any wrongdoing, said Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voting system implementation manager, in a Dec. 4 tweet .\n\""The 90 second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by @GaSecofState investigators,\"" Sterling wrote, linking to a fact-check from Lead Stories . \""Shows normal ballot processing.\"".\nThe 90 second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by @GaSecofState investigators. Shows normal ballot processing. Here is the fact check on it. https://t.co/HVJsvDjDvi December 4, 2020.\nReporters for Lead Stories spoke with Sterling about the surveillance video. They also talked to Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief investigator, and an unidentified state election board monitor who was present in the room late on election night.\nThe ballots seen in the video were not in suitcases, the officials told Lead Stories. They were in standard ballot containers. And there was nothing illegal about the way they were processed.\\xc2\\xa0.\nIn reality, the ballots had been removed from their envelopes and processed while news media personnel and observers were still in the room. Nobody was ever told to leave, Watson told Lead Stories. But some observers exited after the election workers responsible for opening the envelopes and verifying the ballots had finished their job and started taking off for the night.\nThe observers were allowed to return at any time, Watson told Lead Stories. Lead Stories and Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that while the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law allows partisan observers to watch, it does not actually require that they be present for ballots to be counted.\nThat lines up with the sequence of events Sterling described in response to a Facebook post about the video. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what he said:.\n\""When the workers began packing up to go, there were two groups, the cutters and the counters. Cutters opened, stacked and prepared ballots for scanning. Scanners \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 well, they scanned. All of them heard a supervisor say we are finishing for the night, because the cutters had completed their work. The scanners heard they were \\xe2\\x80\\x98done\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and started packing up to leave. During that time the elections director called the absentee supervisor at State Farm to tell him the scanners needed to continue their work. So people had already started to leave or had left \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 cutters, media, monitors. But the video shows no new boxes of ballots brought out from a table, they were all there when the media and monitors were in the room. The video shows them getting back to work scanning. When the (state elections board) monitor arrives they continue to do the same thing they had been doing all night. When the (secretary of state) investigator got there they continued doing the same thing.\"".\nSterling also addressed claims about the video in an interview on Newsmax \\xc2\\xa0and walked through the surveillance tape with a WSB-TV reporter .\nRichard Barron, the elections director in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, also addressed the issue with the county\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elections officials. In a video published online by 11Alive, the NBC affiliate TV station in Atlanta, he described sending instructions for the scanners to keep going.\n\""No announcement was ever made to leave, for anyone to leave,\"" Barron said. \""Certain staff that were on the cutting stations, that were on the flattening stations, that were extracting from the inner envelopes, those staff left as work completed. I found out sometime, I think a little after 10:30, that they were going to cease operations, and I told them not to do that.\"".\n\""It was normal processing that occurred there,\"" said Barron, who added that the plastic bins shown in the video were \""bins that they keep under their desks near the scanners.\"".\nOther reporters also disputed claims that the video showed illegal counting by election workers. Fulton County tweeted Dec. 4 that it was \""aware of no credible reports of voter fraud.\""\\xc2\\xa0.\nA spokesperson for OAN said the video shared by Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign and supporters was taken from the network\\xe2\\x80\\x99s live coverage of Giuliani\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presentation at the hearing in Georgia. The source and presentation of the video was not originally from OAN, the spokesperson said.\nSocial media posts claim that video from Georgia shows suitcases filled with ballots pulled from under a table and illegally counted after election observers were told to leave. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong.\nState officials have said there was no suitcase, no instruction to leave, and no illegal counting of ballots.

Obviously, they should be investigating this. I would image they already are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAttorney Jacki Pick presented the video at the hearing on Thursday. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at one big room here; this is where, according to our witnesses, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given sworn affidavits, this is where the absentee ballots and military ballots are being tabulated on Election Day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, showcasing the security video.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, we have the tape from first thing in the morning, all the way past the close of the polls. What you have, is essentially, two Republican field organizers who were sent here to be observers; at no time were they actually permitted to observe in a meaningful way \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 they are roped off on the side.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe observers are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing to get there at about 8 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock (in the morning) to watch the tabulation of absentee and military ballots,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pick continued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut according to their affidavits, at about 10 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock, there was one person working the polls who told everyone in the room to leave, on the basis they were going to stop counting and return at 8:30 in the morning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccording to the witnesses, the Republican observers, there is a lady who has blonde braids who comes out to announce we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop counting, everyone go home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, in fact, we see that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens is everyone clears out, including the Republican observers and the press, but four people stay behind and continue counting and tabulating well into the night \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 And they will continue counting unobserved, unsupervised not in public view as your statute requires, until about 1 in the morning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe reason we know this is because when our Republican observers were forced to leave, they went to the central tabulation center and they got news from a word from a news crew that, in fact, counting had continued,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pick detailed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey got word that not everybody left according to plan, and some people stayed behind. So this shocked them, so they returned back to State Farm Arena at about one o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, where they confirmed that, in fact, people had just left State Farm Arena in contravention of what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told by the supervisors who are running this operation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nPick then shows the video footage from about 10:25 p.m. on Election Day. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to watch this place be busy and filled up to emptied at some time between 10:25 and 10:35, which is consistent with what the affidavits say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nAt 10:37, Pick shows, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe place is a ghost town. This is where the people were vacated and told go home come back at 8:30. We will now stop working and stop counting. But notice who stays behind: you have four people, consistent with our affidavits, who stayed behind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One of the women who stays behind, she says, was one of the people who told everyone the counting had stopped.\nPick then details what looks like \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuitcases\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of ballots being pulled from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderneath a table.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The people left behind wait until everyone else leaves, and then \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmove into action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscanning ballots.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe attorney said her team asked themselves, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOkay, is it normal, to store suitcases of ballots under a table under a tablecloth? Is that how they run the place? Maybe this is what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing all day? \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 So we went back and watched the video, as a team of us: we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis table, the black one, was placed there by the lady with the blonde braids at about 8:22 a.m. in the morning. So she put that table there. The same person who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staying behind now, the same person who cleared the place out under the pretense that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop counting is the person who put the table there at 8:22 in the morning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pick said, noting that her teams needs 14-hours to comb through the footage. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYeah, I saw four suitcases come out from underneath the table.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nOn Thursday night, Sterling told left-wing fact-checking site Lead Stories that the video was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal procedure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing looks \\xe2\\x80\\x98bizarre or odd.'\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lead Stories reported:.\nElection workers known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccutters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because their job was to open absentee ballot envelopes and verify ballots for eventual scanning and counting were dismissed for the night sometime after 10 p.m. on November 3, 2020, because their work for the evening had been completed, [Sterling] explained. Those workers who remained were responsible for conducting the scanning portion of the process, since ballots could not be left without being scanned overnight.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you look at the video tape, the work you see is the work you would expect, which is you take the sealed suitcase looking things in, you place the ballots on the scanner in manageable batches and you scan them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sterling said.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bin that had ballots in it under that table,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Watson said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was an empty bin and the ballots from it were actually out on the table when the media were still there, and then it was placed back into the box when the media were still there and placed next to the table.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody told them to stay. Nobody told them to leave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said of the allegedly dismissed election observers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody gave them any advice on what they should do. And It was still open for them or the public to come back in to view at whatever time they wanted to, as long as they were still working.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Election Day that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno official could explain before press time why Fulton was stopping its count of absentee ballots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at 10:30 p.m., \\xe2\\x80\\x9conly saying that was the procedure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey planned to stop scanning absentee ballots at 10:30 p.m. and pick it up back in the morning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the report said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo official could explain before press time why Fulton was stopping its count of absentee ballots at that time, only saying that was the procedure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs planned, Fulton County will continue to tabulate the remainder of absentee ballots over the next two days,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a county spokeswoman said in a statement. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbsentee ballot processing requires that each ballot is opened, signatures verified, and ballots scanned.

We need your help. .\nIn both classified and public reports , U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered actions to interfere with the election. Those actions included the cyber-theft of private data, the placement of propaganda against particular candidates, and an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.\nMembers of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have held open and closed door hearings to probe Russia\u2019s actions. The congressional investigations are ongoing.\nFacebook, Google and Twitter have investigated their own networks, and their executives have concluded \u2014\u00a0in some cases after initial foot-dragging \u2014\u00a0that Russia used the online platforms in attempts to influence the election.\n\""This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won,\"" said President Donald Trump in an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt in May.\nOn Twitter in September, Trump said, \""The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\"".\nAnd during an overseas trip to Asia in November, Trump spoke of meeting with Putin: \""Every time he sees me, he says, \u2018I didn't do that.\u2019 And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"" In the same interview, Trump referred to the officials who led the intelligence agencies during the election as \""political hacks.\"".\nTrump continually asserts that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election is fake news, a hoax or a made-up story, even though there is widespread, bipartisan evidence to the contrary.\nWhen the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief refuses to acknowledge a threat to U.S. democracy, it makes it all the more difficult to address the problem. For this reason, we name Trump\u2019s claim that the Russia interference is a hoax as our Lie of the Year for 2017.\nIt seems unlikely \u2014\u00a0though not impossible \u2014\u00a0that Russia interference changed the outcome of the election. We at PolitiFact have seen no compelling evidence that it did so.\nTrump could acknowledge the interference happened while still standing by the legitimacy of his election and his presidency \u2014\u00a0but he declines to do so. Sometimes he\u2019ll state firmly there was \""no collusion\"" between his campaign and Russia, an implicit admission that Russia did act in some capacity. Then he reverts back to denying the interference even happened.\nIt\u2019s not so much that Trump trades in falsehoods \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s more that he tries to create a different version of reality simply by asserting it.\nThat denial is of a different order from most presidential posturing, said Nicholas Burns, who served as ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush.\n\""I've worked for both parties,\"" Burns said during public testimony to the Republican-controlled Congress this summer. \""It's inconceivable to me that any of President Trump's predecessors would deny the gravity of such an open attack on our democratic system.\n\""I don't believe any previous American president would argue that your own hearings in the Senate are a waste of time or, in the words of President Trump, a witch hunt. They're not; you're doing your duty, that the people elected you to do.\"".\nNew cyber tools had come online, with Facebook putting robust sharing options in the hands of its users. In previous presidential cycles, online organizing had been innovative or unusual. In 2016, the sharing of political information online was widespread, cheap and easy to execute.\nMeanwhile, Russia was concerned about its standing after conflicts with the former Soviet republic of Georgia. International sanctions resulted from Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, which Putin wanted to see lifted.\nPutin also had particular animosity toward Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee who had served as secretary of state. Putin openly blamed Clinton for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012. A publicly available intelligence assessment said that Putin also \""holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him.\"".\nIn July 2016, Wikileaks released thousands of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The release led to DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepping down after grassroots activists accused her of favoring Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. Both intelligence officials and cybersecurity specialists concluded the hack had all the marks of a Russian operation. In October, Wikileaks began publishing the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.\nMeanwhile, media websites connected to Russia, such as RT and Sputnik , spread suspicious or even fake news reports during the election, aided by online trolls and bots. Sputnik published an article that claimed Podesta\u2019s email included incriminating information about events in Benghazi, an allegation that turned out to be incorrect . (Trump himself repeated this false story.).\nRussian hackers attempted to get into the computer systems of local elections officials around the country. The attempts never penetrated vote tallying systems, according to federal agencies , but the federal government warned local officials to redouble efforts to secure their systems.\nIf Trump wanted to address the Russia controversy head on, he could argue that he was correcting a lack of action on the part of the Obama administration, which learned in summer 2016 that election-related hacks could be traced back to the Russian government.\nPresident Barack Obama personally confronted Putin at the September G20 Summit in China; other high-level contacts took place as well. Back home, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson warned state-level elections officials to protect voting-related systems from cyber intrusions.\nBut the overall response of the Obama team before the election was muted \u2014\u00a0perhaps due to concerns about the appearance of playing politics, or because they thought Clinton would be the certain winner of the election.\nAs it turned out, the most significant actions the Obama administration took happened after the election. In late December, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected operatives to leave the United States, and he ordered more sanctions.\nSoon after Obama moved against Russia, Michael Flynn, then named as Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, contacted Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn asked that Russia not escalate the situation with a specific response to Obama\u2019s actions.\nLater, in January 2017, Flynn told the FBI falsely that he hadn\u2019t spoken about sanctions with Kislyak. That wasn\u2019t true. On Dec. 1, Flynn made a plea deal with special prosecutor Robert Mueller, pleading guilty to one count of making false statements to federal investigators.\nMeanwhile, technology companies spent 2017 investigating how much activity from Russian interests unfolded on Facebook and Twitter. Facebook estimated that 126 million people were served Russia-influenced content during the two-year period before the election.\n\""The Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust,\"" said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in November. \""We build these tools to help people connect and bring us closer together. They used them to try to undermine our values. What they did is wrong, and we're not going to stand for it.\"".\nCongressional committees have in recent months released some of the ads that Russia-affiliated groups placed on Facebook; they seemed aimed at stoking anger on both the right (\""I want Sharia law banned in every state across America!\"") and the left (\"" Black Panthers were dismantled by US government because they were black men and women standing up for justice and equality\"").\nSome ads were overtly anti-Clinton.

After first claiming that no one from the campaign met with the Russians, they\u2019ve admitted to several meetings, including a June 2016 meeting attended by Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr.; then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort; and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nTrump\u2019s labeling of the Russia story as a hoax fits in with his pattern of dismissing critical coverage as \""fake news.\"" He\u2019s used the term when he believes his administration doesn\u2019t get complimentary coverage, such as hurricane cleanup in Puerto Rico, or even when his comments have been reported accurately, such as his remarks about white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.\nSince the beginning of 2017, President Trump has publicly invoked the phrase \""fake news\"" more than 170 times. Virtually every instance has been in response to critical news coverage.\nTrump has insisted there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. Some legal experts have said that it would be far-fetched to think the Trump campaign has broken laws.\n\""Even if it were to turn out that the Trump campaign collaborated, colluded or cooperated with Russian agents, that alone would not be a crime, unless the campaign asked them or helped them to commit criminal acts such as hacking,\"" said attorney Alan M. Dershowitz in an op-ed for the New York Times .\nIt\u2019s that characterization \u2014\u00a0that Russia\u2019s interference in the election doesn\u2019t even exist \u2014\u00a0that is contradicted by a mountain of evidence, say foreign policy experts.\n\""There certainly has been some speculation in the media that has gotten ahead of the facts.

The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic -- you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.

It doesn't really even matter where it comes from. They don't buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different.

It's deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people. It's deplorable that he's attacked a federal judge for his \u2018Mexican heritage,\u2019 bullied a Gold Star family because of their Muslim faith, and promoted the lie that our first black president is not a true American. So I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. I also meant what I said last night about empathy, and the very real challenges we face as a country where so many people have been left out and left behind. As I said, many of Trump's supporters are hard-working Americans who just don\u2019t feel like the economy or our political system are working for them.

But then there is this basic question: What was Hunter Biden doing on the board of a Ukrainian energy company?.\nBiden had no particular expertise in energy or Ukraine. He did, however, join the board of Burisma when his father Vice President Joe Biden was publicly representing U.S. policy on the country, which had become the center of a tug-of-war between Russia and the West.\nDid the older Biden do anything wrong? Nothing has been proven. But what the adult son was up to remains mysterious, as are the details of what he was paid.\nHunter Biden\u2019s work attracted attention at the time. The oligarch behind the firm, Mykola Zlochevsky, faced investigations for money laundering and tax evasion. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.).\nGeorge Kent, the senior anticorruption coordinator in the State Department's European Bureau, recently testified in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Kent said he raised the issue with the vice president\u2019s staff, but was told that the vice president's son Beau was dying of cancer and that \""there was no further bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.\"".\nReporting from The New Yorker published in April 2019 suggests that Hunter Biden was suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction while looking for work to support a high-end professional lifestyle.\nSome of the most detailed reporting on his Burisma work comes from Reuters but relies on unnamed sources. Reuters reported that Hunter Biden weighed in during scheduled meetings but did little of specific substance. There\u2019s no evidence that he ever went to Ukraine or was in the country. The report suggests he was compensated for contributing his high-profile name.\nIn an October interview with ABC News , Biden said he and his father never discussed specifics of his work with Ukraine. He also said he earned his seat because of his previous work as an attorney and experience on the board of Amtrak and the United Nations World Food Program.\nWhen asked if he would have been invited onto the Burisma board if he\u2019d had a different last name, he said, \""I don\u2019t know.

We wanted to look at McCarthy\u2019s comments in their full context and let readers judge what he meant for themselves.\nThe Hannity interview wasn\u2019t the friendliest. Hannity focused on whether Republicans in Congress were doing a good enough job at stopping President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda. Hannity kicked off the interview with this question: \""60 percent of Republicans polled this week feel betrayed by the Republican Party in Washington. Are they justified? I'm one of them.\"".\nFrom there, Hannity and McCarthy had a spirited back-and-forth over the health care law, immigration, federal spending (including so-called \""Cromnibus\"" legislation) and Planned Parenthood. Below is the portion of the conversation about Benghazi. (Watch the entire 11-minute interview via .).\nWe should note that in a subsequent and , McCarthy has said the committee was not political, calling its integrity \""beyond reproach.\"".\nHannity : \""Let me ask you this. You voted 50 times to repeal Obamacare, but there's a constitutional power you guys have that you don't use. And it seems all Obama has to do is mention we're going to shut down the government and blame Republicans, you fund Obamacare. You fund executive amnesty, which you told us, the whole Republican caucus told us they would stop, if we would elect the Senate last year. They funded it. And you're about to fund Planned Parenthood.\"".\nMcCarthy : \""Sean, no, Sean, amnesty is not going on. The courts have stopped that. There's no funding there. And there should not be as we go forward.\"".\nMcCarthy : \""No, no. Sean, no, because the courts had put a stay on that. So there was no funding going towards that. The question I think you really want to ask me is, how am I going to be different?\"".\nMcCarthy : \""I knew you'd want to ask it. What you're going to see is a conservative speaker that takes a conservative Congress that puts a strategy (in place) to fight and win.\n\""And let me give you one example. Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's un-trustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought and made that happen.\"".\nHannity : \""I agree. I give you credit for that. I give you credit for sequestration, I'll give you credit where credit is due. But here's what every conservative wants to know. Are you willing to defund Obamacare and use your constitutional authority? Are you willing to use the power of the purse to defund Planned Parenthood? Will you use the power of the purse to stop the power grab of this president through the use of executive amnesty, ignoring our laws and our constitution? If you're speaker, will you go into your conference and say, this is what we should do, we need to unite together?\"".\nMcCarthy : \""I will unite them and, yes, we'll do it. But you know what. We're not going to do it when we have one day. This is what we're going to do, Sean, and we're not going to be able to do it alone. We're going to put a strategy today just as we do a select committee on Planned Parenthood. So we go out across the country and they see \u2014 the president won't even watch those videos.

(AP photo/Wayne Parry) .\nIn an effort to take out frontrunner Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidates have pelted Trump with criticism over his multiple trips to federal bankruptcy court.\nThat criticism was on full display in CNN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Republican debate Sept. 16. Most notably, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina criticized Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history of bankruptcies in his businesses.\n\""You know, there are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people\\'s money,\"" Fiorina said. \""That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people\\'s money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times.\"".\nTrump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deny that four of his businesses have filed for bankruptcy. He argues, however, that filing for bankruptcy is a common business decision, and he was smart to make the moves when he did.\n\""Hundreds of companies\"" have filed for bankruptcy, Trump said earlier in the debate. \""I used the law four times and made a tremendous thing. I\\'m in business. I did a very good job.\"".\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four bankruptcies were Chapter 11 reorganizations (named for its location in federal bankruptcy code), which are designed to restructure businesses without shutting them down completely. The purpose is to \""save\"" the business, as opposed to other forms of bankruptcy which would liquidate the company, said Michael Venditto, a partner at the ReedSmith law firm who has extensive experience with Chapter 11.\nBecause they keep coming up, we decided to outline Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four bankruptcies. We also talked to some finance experts, who told us Trump is correct that Chapter 11 reorganization is not always the result of bad business decisions.\nThe first bankruptcy associated with Trump was perhaps the most significant in terms of his personal finances, according to news reports at the time. He funded the construction of the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. By 1991, the casino was nearly $3 billion in debt, while Trump had racked up nearly $900 million in personal liabilities, so the business decided to file for Chapter 11 reorganization, according to the New York Times . As a result, Trump gave up half his personal stake in the casino and sold his yacht and airline, according to the Washington Post .\nTrump acquired the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million in 1988. By 1992, the hotel had accumulated $550 million in debt. As a result of the bankruptcy, in exchange for easier terms on which to pay off the debts, Trump relinquished a 49 percent stake in the Plaza to a total of six lenders, according to ABC News . Trump remained the hotel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CEO, but it was merely a gesture -- he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t earn a salary and had no say in the hotel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s day-to-day operations, according to the New York Times .\nTrump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004 when his casinos -- including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City and a riverboat casino in Indiana -- had accrued an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to the Associated Press . Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he was still the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that the company represented less than 1 percent of his net worth.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nTrump Entertainment Resorts -- formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts --\\xc2\\xa0was hit hard by the 2008 economic recession and missed a $53.1 million bond interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. After debating with the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s board of directors, Trump resigned as the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name in licensing.\nWhile it would be better to avoid a situation where Chapter 11 reorganization is necessary, filing for bankruptcy can be a \""sound business decision\"" when the company is facing serious financial problems, Venditto said. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better than the business shutting down completely.\n\""However, the source of the financial problems varies from case to case,\"" he said. \""Sometimes it is the result of circumstances beyond the control of the business. Sometime it caused by poor judgment. More frequently, it is a combination.\"".\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four bankruptcies all happened within the past 25 years. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot, said Stephen Lubben, a leading expert in corporate finance and professor at Seton Hall School of Law. But to be fair, the gaming industry has been struggling the past few years, he added, and three out of four of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bankruptcies were tied to casinos.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for the four bankruptcies because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s acting as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, said Adam Levitin , a law professor at Georgetown University.\nHe added that people typically wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t personally blame former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney or investor Warren Buffett for individual failures within their investment companies, Bain Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively.\n\""The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he\\'s not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,\"" Levitan said. \""These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn\\'t color our view of him.\"".\nWhile it is accurate that Trump filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy four times, Fiorina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell the whole story. In context, Fiorina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phrasing suggests Trump was personally responsible for the failures of these businesses, but in reality, much was out of Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s control -- such as a struggling casino industry.

We need your help. .\nFormer\\xc2\\xa0Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said\\xc2\\xa0it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense that President Andrew Jackson will no longer be the centerpiece of the $20 bill because he was the last master of the federal budget.\n\""Well I think Andrew Jackson was a tremendous secretary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I mean a tremendous president,\"" Carson said . \""I mean, Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt.\"".\nBlack abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who rescued slave families using the underground railroad, will replace Jackson on the front of the $20 bill, while a smaller image of Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face will appear on the back. Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance on the bill has stirred up controversy as of late, especially because Jackson, a populist and a war hero, presided over the removal of approximately 46,000 Native Americans from their land.\nWe wondered if Carson had his historical facts straight. We took Carson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement to mean that Jackson was the last president to do both things: balance the budget and eliminate debt.\nA lot of presidents have presided over balanced budgets, which is when the government takes in more revenue than it spends, leading to no net borrowing in that year. But a balanced budget doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily mean no debt, because old debt can carry over from previous years. Jackson was, in fact, the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget.\nHowever, this wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t nearly as dramatic of an accomplishment as it would be today. Experts told us to take this factoid with a grain of salt because the debt was already on its way down, and by the time Jackson took office, the amount of debt was trivial.\nJackson, who served from 1829-37, was an ardent supporter of keeping banks and government separated. He believed that banks would have undue influence on government, and he was hell-bent on eliminating the debt.\n(Jackson was also deeply skeptical of paper currency, which adds some irony to the current debate over his position on the $20 bill.).\nIn January 1829, the debt was about $58 million. (Jackson took office that March.) In today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dollars, that amounts to about $1.4 billion . The total public debt outstanding today is higher by many orders of magnitude: $19.2 trillion.\nJackson watched that debt scale down to zero in 1835 . According to the Treasury Department , the debt remained close to zero when Jackson left office.\nBut Jackson didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to take much action to make this happen. Since the end of the War of 1812, which racked up a lot of debt, Congress required debt reductions of at least $10 million per year under under Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two predecessors, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. So all Jackson really had to do was maintain the status quo, said Daniel Feller , a Jackson expert at the University of Tennessee.\n\""The policy of paying off the debt happened before Jackson, and he happened to be president\"" when the debt hit zero, Feller said.\nIn addition to continuing the already-established debt-reduction policy, Jackson vetoed some infrastructure bills that would have spent money on things like building roads.\nHe also liquidated the Second Bank of the United States, a precursor to the Federal Reserve, resulting in a massive surplus of government money that was used to pay off the last of the debt, said Neil Buchanan , an expert in federal spending patterns at George Washington University Law School.\nImmediately following Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure, the country experienced a financial crisis, the Panic of 1837. The panic resulted from several factors, including the collapse of a speculative land bubble and international capital flows, but some economists believe Jackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fiscal policies should carry some of the blame.\n\""The country did eventually have the good sense to borrow again, to finance the country\\'s enormous economic expansion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries,\"" Buchanan said, noting that it is not always desirable to bring debt down to zero.\nWhile the only president to see a national debt of zero, Jackson certainly wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only president who presided over a balanced budget.\nIn today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s world, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rare for the federal government to balance its budget, meaning revenue is higher than expenditures. Since the 1960s, only five years have had balanced federal budgets: 1969 under President Richard Nixon; 1998, 1999 and 2000 under Bill Clinton; and 2001 under George W. Bush.\nBut in earlier years, balanced budgets were much more regular. From 1900 to 1960, about 25 years had balanced budgets, according to government historical tables . Before that, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have \\xc2\\xa0year-to-year budget breakdowns. But we do know that there was an overall budget surplus from 1800 through 1850 , so balanced budgets were a fairly regular occurrence around the time Jackson was in office. Fuller backed up that point.\n\""Carson is merely applauding Jackson for having paid off the debt through a one-time gimmick,\"" as opposed to adjusting policy to keep the debt low for the long run, Buchanan said.\nExperts say this feat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really deserve the plaudits Carson is giving it, but Carson has his facts basically right. Jackson was the last \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and only \\xe2\\x80\\x94 president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget.\n Says Barack Obama found out about Russia \""in August.

But he said something truly horrifying: He became the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election,\"" Clinton said at an Oct. 24 rally in New Hampshire. \""Now that is a direct threat to our democracy.\"".\nWe wondered if Trump really is the first presidential candidate in American history who would not say that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll accept the election results.\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to prove a negative. But historians and experts in campaign rhetoric told us that while campaigns have challenged results after Election Day, they are unaware of any prior presidential candidate casting so much doubt about an election before it even happens.\nBefore we get into the historical context, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a quick look at Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exact words from the final presidential debate Oct. 19. Moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he would \""absolutely accept the result of this election.\"".\n\""I will look at it at the time,\"" Trump said. \""I\\'m not looking at anything now. I\\'ll look at it at the time.\"".\n\""But, sir,\"" Wallace said, \""there is a tradition in this country \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in fact, one of the prides of this country \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Are you saying you\\'re not prepared now to commit to that principle?\"".\nThe fact that Trump has to answer a question like this is a first, said Tammy Vigil, a Boston University professor who researches campaign rhetoric. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no precedent for a major party candidate being so publicly skeptical of an upcoming election.\n\""Most major party candidates do not make contesting the results an issue; it is simply assumed that they will accept the outcome of the vote,\"" Vigil said. \""For that reason few candidates are ever asked the question in as direct a manner as Trump was asked it in the debate. The fact of him having to answer a direct query makes it unusual, and so his answer is unusual.\"".\nTrump is certainly not the first candidate in recent memory to question whether there will be voter fraud. In 2008, Republican nominee John McCain said the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Acorn, was \""on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.\"".\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nHistorians pointed out several examples of elections in the 19th and 20th centuries when the popular vote or electoral college vote was so close that the final results were controversial. But in none of those cases did the presidential candidate challenge the election before it took happened.\nTake the most recent example: the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the results of which eventually came down in a Supreme Court decision. In that case, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until after Election Day that Gore requested the recount in Florida.\nAfter an exceptionally close race between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy in 1960, some Republicans called for a recount, but Nixon distanced himself from them.\nIn the 1800s, several elections fell into the hands of Congress. In those cases, the political parties questioned whether the final results \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not the popular vote but the pending congressional decisions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 would be legitimate, said Alex Keyssar, a Harvard University professor and expert in voting history. However, he added that the candidates themselves did not question the legitimacy of the outcome before the election took place.\n\""Even in 1800, 1824 and 1876, where resolutions took almost until Inauguration Day, we had an outcome accepted, if grudgingly and with concessions, from both parties,\"" Rosenwald said. \""People on the losing sides in these elections, as well as 1960 and 2000, often went to their graves believing that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d had an election stolen from them, but they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move to start or encourage a rebellion.\"".\nAlso notable is the 1860 race. In the lead-up to that election, politicians in several southern states plotted to secede if Abraham Lincoln were to win, said Daniel Feller, a professor of mid 19th century history at the University of Tennessee.\nBut none of the four presidential candidates that year advocated on the campaign trail for secession if Lincoln were to win, Feller said. Additionally, the South viewed the election results as legitimate and as confirmation that the northern states wanted to stifle their way of life.\n\""Have other presidential candidates announced beforehand they would not accept the results of the election? Not to my knowledge,\"" Feller said. \""But has there been a case when enough Americans rejected the results of the election to disrupt the system? Yes.\"".\nClinton said\\xc2\\xa0Trump is \""the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.\"".\nThere are examples of presidential campaigns challenging elections or raising concerns about corruption after Election Day. But historians and experts cannot point to an example of a presidential candidate himself refusing to say he would accept the results before the election even happens.\nIf an example of a past presidential candidate saying something equivalent to Trump comes up, or if we find additional information to support Clinton\\'s claim,\\xc2\\xa0we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll update our story. But with the information we have available, for now we rate Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim Mostly True.\n Says Barack Obama found out about Russia \""in August. Now, the election was in November.

On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.\nSpeaking of Iraq, Trump said, \""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn\\'t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He\\'s under a lot of pressure. I think he\\'s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\"".\nTrump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim: that Bush should not proceed because a war would \\xc2\\xa0\""destabilize the Middle East.\"".\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nA week later, Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after party, Trump said that \""the war\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mess,\"" according to the Washington Post . He told Fox News that because of the war, \""The market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to go up like a rocket.\"".\n\""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we\\'re in.

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war in the first place.\nRegarding the Iraq War, \""I was the one that said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to destabilize the Middle East.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \"".\nMaybe Trump felt this way privately, but he made no publicly reported comments in the lead up to the Iraq War that reflect this sentiment.

Richard Burr, R-N.C., listens to Democratic challenger Deborah Ross during a debate in Research Triangle Park, N.C., on Oct. 13, 2016. (AP/Gerry Broome, Pool) .\nDeborah Ross, the Democratic challenger for Republican Sen. Richard Burr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seat representing North Carolina in the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said Burr is a consummate Washington insider.\nThis summer she claimed that Burr \""took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks.\"" We rated that Half True .\n\""It is a fact that Sen. Burr was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress,\"" Ross said in their recent debate. \""And he called that vote brave.\"".\nBurr doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deny the vote in question, but he repeatedly said it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being blown way out of proportion. He defended his actions in 2012 after the vote, and again last month at his debate with Ross.\nInsider trading is when someone uses non-public information to buy or sell stocks to maximize profit. Depending on the circumstances, it can be legal or illegal .\nIn April 2012, the STOCK Act \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which stands for Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge \\xe2\\x80\\x93 specifically said lawmakers could not use their insider knowledge to trade stocks. It also created several new or stronger ethics and transparency provisions for members of Congress and their staffs.\nPresident Obama asked Congress to pass the bill in his 2012 State of the Union address. A few months later, he got his wish and signed it into law with much fanfare. It was a rare moment of bipartisan celebration, although Ross is right that Burr was one of three holdouts.\n\""It is illegal, in law, even for Congress, to trade on insider trading,\"" Burr said in response to Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99 barb at their debate. \""That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the reason I opposed the STOCK Act. North Carolinians did not send me to Washington to duplicate existing law, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in fact what the STOCK Act did.\"".\nThere is no statutory definition of when exactly insider trading becomes illegal, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often up to individual judges or investigators to decide.\nWhile Congress was never specifically exempted from insider trading rules, there was widespread disagreement in the legal and financial communities over what officials could or couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do.\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the mood for a 59-page legal analysis of the differing opinions, read this 2011 paper . Or, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a brief synopsis: Some people said the law applied to everyone in Congress. Some\\xc2\\xa0said elected officials had to abide by insider trading laws, but their staffers did not. Some said both elected officials and their staffs were exempt.\nSince the Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of policing insider trading, we decided to see what its officials thought at the time. Unfortunately, two high-level officials gave opposite interpretations of the law.\nFormer SEC CEO Arthur Levitt said in 2010 that elected officials and their staffers \""benefit from an exemption that the average investor doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t benefit from. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re immune from insider trading laws.\"" However, former SEC director of enforcement Robert Khuzami said in 2011 that neither elected officials nor their staffers were \""exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions.\"".\nRegardless of the lack of clarity in the law, we do know that members of Congress and their staffers routinely made timely trades centered around upcoming policy decisions.\n\""Since even the best hedge-fund managers find it hard to achieve comparable results, we must conclude that these senators either are better than hedge-fund managers, or that they benefit from privileged information,\"" Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, wrote in 2011.\nZingales said it was his opinion that members of Congress did participate in insider trading, \""despite the potential cost to their reputations.\"".\nIn 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigated allegations of insider trading by congressional staffers. It found dozens of aides on both sides of the aisle had invested tens of\\xc2\\xa0thousands of dollars in stocks that soon benefitted from their bosses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 policy decisions.\nOne aide nearly doubled his investment in a renewable energy company just before his boss pushed for a new law that benefitted companies like it. Another aide bought thousands of dollars worth of Bank Of America stock just before a report \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which her boss was involved in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 found in the bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favor and sent stock prices surging.\nYet even if Burr is right that insider trading laws applied to Congress that whole time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it appears no one knows the real answer to that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still not correct that the law was purely duplicative.\nThe STOCK Act also strengthened the power of ethics investigators in Congress and expanded transparency requirements \\xe2\\x80\\x93 although Congress quietly rolled back the transparency requirements within a year of passing the original bill.\nBut is Ross also right that Burr called himself brave for voting against the STOCK Act? Yes, and we found the transcript of his remarks on Burr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own website.\n\""It\\'s ludicrous,\"" Burr said in a February 2012 radio interview, while discussions over the bill were still ongoing. \""That\\'s why Dr. Tom Coburn (a Republican senator from Oklahoma) and I were the two brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn\\'t be doing this.\"".\nBurr and Coburn joined with Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico in casting the only \\xe2\\x80\\x98no\\xe2\\x80\\x99 votes when the bill passed the Senate 96-3.\nRoss said Burr \""was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress. And he called that vote brave.\"".\nShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right about Burr\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vote and the fact that Burr called it brave. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less clear is whether the STOCK Act simply clarified the law regarding insider trading in Congress, or made actual changes. Regardless, the law did make other changes that Burr ignores when he says his opposition was because the bill was totally duplicative.\nRobert Khuzami, SEC enforcement director, Dec. 1, 2011, \""Statement on the Application of Insider Trading Law to Trading by Members of Congress and Their Staffs\"".\nRichard Burr\u2019s Senate website, Feb. 2, 2012, \""Senator Richard Burr Discusses the STOCK Act, Economy, Housing, Syria & Afghanistan with Jerri Jameson\"".\n Says the Senate Intelligence Committee has held 10 public hearings this year, \""more than double that held by the committee in any recent year.\"" .\n Says there are thousands of registered voters over 110 years old in North Carolina, including one who is 219 years old. .\n Says the T.R.U.M.P.

Tony Evers first declared a public health emergency on March 12. .\nKit Beyer, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, noted seven of the nine other full-time legislatures are in states with an annual budget, a process requiring more floor sessions. .\nBoth Beyer and a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, also highlighted committee action and the floor calendar approved by a vast majority of state lawmakers at the beginning of the legislative session. That calendar set the last regularly scheduled floor period at the end of March. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRepublicans in Wisconsin have refused to take COVID-19 seriously from the beginning and continue to be unfazed by this crisis even after more than 50 reported COVID-19 deaths in three days,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said in an email. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWisconsinites deserve elected officials who will put politics aside and show up to work to do the right thing, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the governor will continue to do in responding to this pandemic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nSince Evers first declared a public health emergency due to COVID-19, a quorum of lawmakers has met on the floor just once in each chamber of the GOP-run Wisconsin Legislature. The state Assembly convened in a hybrid virtual/in-person format on April 14 to pass legislation aimed at helping Wisconsin deal with the impact of COVID-19. The Senate met almost entirely online one day later to send the package to Evers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 desk, and the guv signed it into law the same day. .\nBy comparison, a WisPolitics.com review of legislative journals \\xe2\\x80\\x94 combined with outreach to legislative clerks \\xe2\\x80\\x94 found in states with full-time legislatures, the higher and lower chambers combined to convene for between nine and 58 floor sessions since March 12. .\nThe states are: Dem-controlled California (37 meetings), New York (30 meetings), Hawaii (43 meetings), Massachusetts (57 meetings) and Illinois (nine meetings); and GOP-controlled Pennsylvania (33 meetings), Ohio (23 meetings), Michigan (58 meetings) and Alaska (33 meetings). .\nNCSL, a nonpartisan organization currently led by Vos, defines those nine states and Wisconsin as full-time based on three factors: working as a legislator for at least 80 percent of what would be considered a full-time job; employing large staffs; and being compensated well enough to not require supplemental income. .\nWisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other neighbors, Iowa and Minnesota, both fall under NCSL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hybrid full-time/part-time definition. Minnesota lawmakers have met on the floor 62 times since March 12, while the Iowa Legislature met 17 times in that period. In Minnesota, a biennial budget state, the Senate is controlled by Republicans while Dems control the House. Republicans in Iowa control both chambers of the statehouse as well as the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual budget process. .\nSince the Wisconsin Legislature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last meeting in April, Evers has urged them to take action on COVID-19. Still, the only special session he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called was to address police policies. .\nAfter Republican lawmakers sued the Evers administration over an extension of the guv\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stay-at-home order, the state Supreme Court struck down the directive and ruled it should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been issued as a rule to give lawmakers oversight of the process. .\nLawyers representing Republican lawmakers in that suit indicated in an April legal brief the Legislature was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cready, willing, and able to work with DHS and at the same time craft legislation (which it is drafting even now) to respond to the pandemic in a comprehensive and balanced fashion and guided by federal recommendations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe state now ranks among the worst in the country in coronavirus cases. Wisconsin is also experiencing record hospitalizations and single-day deaths due to the virus. Critics have argued the lack of a statewide plan, which GOP lawmakers now have the power to implement, is the driving force behind the recent COVID-19 spike. .\nQuizzed on the state of COVID-19 in Wisconsin, Beyer said Vos is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconcerned with the rise in COVID cases and deaths.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has been in regular contact with health officials and local leaders on the response to the coronavirus,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpeaker Vos hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard directly from the governor beyond wanting people to wear a mask.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nBeyer also said Vos \\xe2\\x80\\x9cagrees with the governor and the White House that everyone should follow CDC guidelines and he continues to encourage mask wearing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nVos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Facebook page, two Twitter pages and press releases do not contain messaging encouraging mask wearing. Beyer said Vos \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrequently\\xe2\\x80\\x9d backs mask wearing in interviews, press conferences and interactions with constituents but could not provide an example. .\nEvers in July issued a new public health emergency along with a mask mandate while indoors. On Sept. 22, he re-upped both orders for an additional 60 days. .\nFitzgerald suggested after Evers issued the initial mask mandate he has the votes in his caucus to overturn it, saying Senate Republicans are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cready to convene the body\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to end the order. Some Assembly Republicans also issued statements in the wake of the original mask mandate calling for the Legislature to come back for a vote on the directive. .\nThough Vos and Fitzgerald said both the July and the September orders were illegal, the Legislature has yet to reconvene to overturn them. Republican lawmakers today filed a brief supporting a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the mask mandate, a move Cudaback blasted. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unconscionable that Republicans who haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t passed a bill in 170 days somehow mustered the will to join yet another lawsuit aimed at preventing the governor from keeping people safe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said in an email. .\nOrganizations spanning the political spectrum have called for the Legislature to both take up new proposals and give final passage to more than 100 bills awaiting action in the state Senate. Lawmakers can convene in extraordinary session to take up those proposals, but bills that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pass in this two-year session have to be reintroduced, starting the process all over. .\nThe conservative-leaning Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce in mid-September published a letter to lawmakers backed by over 60 business associations, nonprofits and local chambers of commerce asking for action on a proposal that would provide coronavirus liability protection. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Legislature needs to act quickly to protect businesses, non-profits, and individuals doing the right thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the coalition wrote in the letter. .\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson also called on the Legislature to reconvene to take up legislation aimed at allowing absentee ballots sent through the mail to be counted before Election Day. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think we should change the law so the ballots can be counted well before Election Day, so that Wisconsin results are known by 9, 10, 11 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock on Election Day, so Wisconsin isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t part of the problem,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Oshkosh Republican said in an interview aired Sunday on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpFront\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program, which is produced in partnership with WisPolitics.com. .\nSen. Kathy Bernier \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a Chippewa Falls Republican and former county clerk who chairs the Senate panel overseeing elections \\xe2\\x80\\x94 told WisPolitics.com last month she had no interest in such a bill, citing concerns about transparency. .\nBeyer highlighted Vos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 support for a separate bill that would allow those returning an absentee ballot in-person ahead of election day to feed their ballot into a tabulator at a clerk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office rather than sealing it in an envelope for processing on election day. .\nThat bill was approved by Bernier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s panel along party lines but did not see the Senate floor. The Chippewa Falls Republican said the bill was one of her top priorities in the next legislative session. .\nA host of liberal-leaning and nonpartisan organizations as well as Dem lawmakers have also called on the Assembly and Senate to reconvene to take up myriad other issues ranging from police reform to support for those with disabilities. .\nEvers in August called a special session to take up a package of bills addressing police training and policies in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a Kenosha police officer. But Republicans who control both the Senate and the Assembly instead opted to gavel in and adjourn with few members in the chambers. .\nBoth Beyer and Romportl pointed to an Assembly task force on racial justice and police policies seeking to pull together proposals that could be voted on after lawmakers reconvene in January. .\nThe State Senate Democratic Committee earlier this week attacked Sen. Patrick Testin, R-Stevens Point, and legislative Republicans for being more concerned about \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuing Governor Evers over his life-saving mask mandate than they do about actually doing their jobs and helping Wisconsinites mitigate the damage this pandemic has caused.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs the chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d expect that Senator Testin would be at the forefront of helping both his constituents and his state navigate the perils caused by COVID-19,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SSDC Executive Director Eric LaGesse said in a release. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstead he seems more interested in shooting skeet and holding in-person fundraisers to support his re-election campaign than actually doing his job.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe state Dem Party has targeted vulnerable Assembly Republicans Jim Ott, of Mequon, and Todd Novak, of Dodgeville, with similar criticism. ."", ""evidence"": ""Some Assembly Republicans also issued statements in the wake of the original mask mandate calling for the Legislature to come back for a vote on the directive."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9993027""}]",0

(AP) .\nU.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparred with Fox News\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Jeanine Pirro about how to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.\n\""I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here in Australia, congressman. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have problems like this,\"" Pirro said Aug. 10 following the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. \""This is starting to be unfortunately a uniquely American situation.

There they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela. And now their people can\\'t fight back when they are having to fight their way out of a socialist dictator.\"".\nSo PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into it. The general point Gaetz was trying to make, his spokesman told us, was that he believes gun control failed in both Australia and Venezuela. He shared articles showing an Australian black market for guns , for example, as well as other news stories about Venezuela\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gun control laws leaving civilians and even police more vulnerable .\\xc2\\xa0.\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different from what Venezuela\\xe2\\x80\\x99s government did in 2012 and 2013, when it took steps in an effort to stem\\xc2\\xa0the flow of guns.\nIn 1996, a shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. It was one of the most deadly civilian mass shootings in the world at the time. The conservative-led national government moved quickly to ban and destroy certain guns .\nAustralia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms. After that, people possessing the weapons would be subject to strict penalties. The buyback program took in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons \\xe2\\x80\\x94 roughly one-fifth of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estimated guns.\nToday, Australians still legally own a high per-capita ratio of single-shot long guns, along with plenty of handguns, said Philip Alpers, founding director of Gunpolicy.org , a global project of the Sydney School of Public Health. But the number of legal and illegal guns dropped from about 3.2 million in 1996 to 2.5 million in 1997.\\xc2\\xa0.\nSince then, it has climbed back up to almost the same number as before the ban, though the rate of gun ownership is smaller today.\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Australia suffered 14 mass shootings, which claimed 117 lives, Alpers said. Following the gun law changes, there were no mass shootings for many years. In June 2019, four people were killed by a gunman who used a banned gun . In 2018, seven were killed in a mass family homicide-suicide .\nThe gun situation was not the same, for starters. In Australia, the government responded to a mass shooting. Venezuela faced a widespread problem with rampant gun violence and homicides \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and it still does.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nIn 2012, Venezuela imposed measures to ban possession of a gun in public places and to halt private gun sales to citizens.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe law created an automated system of registration for arms , parts, and ammunition under control of the armed forces. Individuals were allowed conditional possession, meaning that the state could take their gun.\\xc2\\xa0.\nRebecca Hanson, an expert on crime in Venezuela and now a professor at the University of Florida, said she wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t call the 2013 law a \""gun ban,\"" because civilians could still own guns as long as they registered them. Also, guns remained widely available on the black market and enforcement was lax.\nSince the majority of guns are purchased on the black market, regulating the legal market does little to reduce gun sales in Venezuela, she said. Many of these guns end up flowing from state security forces and the military into the black market.\\xc2\\xa0.\nAlejandro Velasco, New York University history professor of modern Latin America, told us that\\xc2\\xa0\""the gun ban had almost no practical impact on people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to buy and keep (or use) weapons.\"".\nThere are no solid numbers to pinpoint the number of guns in civilian ownership in Venezuela. Gunpolicy.org estimates that there were about 5.9 million privately owned guns in civilian hands in Venezuela\\xc2\\xa0 as of 2017, though the consultant that came up with it said it could be a wide range.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe opposition movement has billed itself as nonviolent for the most part, Velasco said. Several experts told us it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not surprising that civilians don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring guns to protests where they face the armed government.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""Even if the disarmament law had dramatically reduced gun ownership, which is not at all clear, armed anti-government civilians would stand no chance against the tanks and fighter jets of the army,\"" said Dorothy Kronick, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist.\n\""Linking the issue of arms control with the struggle for democracy in the Venezuelan context only contributes to distort a situation that is already very distorted,\"" Keymer Avila, a professor of criminology at the Central University of Venezuela said, \""increasing violence in an environment that is already very violent, and undermines an institution that is already very precarious.\"".\nAfter a mass shooting in 1996, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns and offered a one-year buyback. It did not ban all guns. The number of civilian-owned guns is now nearly the same as before the 1996 law, although the rate of ownership is less.\nIn Venezuela, the government instituted measures to try to limit the flow of guns to civilians. But experts said most guns are sold on the black market and that guns remain rampant in Venezuela. The idea that private gun owners could successfully challenge a national military is also unlikely.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe Hill op-ed by David Kopel, In the wake of a gun ban, Venezuela sees rising homicide rate , April 19, 2018.\nAP, Venezuela bans sales of guns and ammunition; critics say most weapons already sold illegally; Venezuela prohibits sales of guns, ammunition , June 1, 2012.\nCNN, Australia reels from worst rampage killing in decades for a country thought to have solved this issue , June 5, 2019.\nInterview, Keymer Avila, researcher at the Institute of Criminal Sciences and Professor of Criminology in Pre and Postgraduate Studies at the Central University of Venezuela and a collaborator of the Observatory of the Criminal System and Human Rights of the University of Barcelona, Aug. 15, 2019.\n The 2020 election could not have been fair because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLos Angeles County agreed, during litigation, that there were 1.2 million ineligible voters after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n When discussing education savings accounts, \""We would be 31st in the nation to have these policies going forward on behalf of kids.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ."", ""evidence"": ""There they went and confiscated all the guns.

The percentage of AP test takers who scored at least a 3 on at least one AP test has declined both nationally and in Texas since 2000, however, the total numbers of AP test takers have also increased significantly during this time period. .\n Source: \\xc2\\xa0PSAT/NMSQT: The College Board, PSAT/NMSQT Data & Reports ( https://reports.collegeboard.org/pdf/2020-texas-sat-suite-assessments-annual-report.pdf ; https://reports.collegeboard.org/pdf/2020-total-group-sat-suite-assessments-annual-report.pdf ); AP: The College Board, AP Program and Participation Data 2020 ( https://research.collegeboard.org/programs/ap/data/archived/ap-2019 ). .\nTexas ranked third in the nation for high school graduation rates in 2017-2018, tying with five other states at 90 percent. Texas ranked highest among the six most populous states and led them in graduation rates within racial and ethnic groups. Nationally, the overall graduation rate in 2017-2018 was 85 percent. .\nThe recent increases in high school graduation rates have been due in part to dramatic reductions in the number of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdropout factory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d high schools in the past 10 years. These schools are defined as having 60 percent or less of their ninth-grade class still enrolled in their senior year. In 2002, more than 2.6 million students were enrolled in these high schools compared to less than 900,000 in 2015. .\n Source: \\xc2\\xa0Graduation Rates: U.S. Department of Education, ED Data Express, Data about elementary and secondary schools in the U.S. ( https://eddataexpress.ed.gov/ ); All else: America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Promise Alliance, 2017 Building a Grad Nation Report: Progress and Challenge in Raising High School Graduation Rates ( http://gradnation.americaspromise.org/report/2017-building-grad-nation-report#driver-5-low-graduation-rate-high-schools ). .\nIn 2019, 15 percent of people age 25 and older (or 3 million people) in Texas had not finished high school. This is almost the same percentage as California (16 percent) and a higher percentage than any other state in the nation. A legacy of historical educational inequity, more recent cohorts of high school graduates rank Texas near the top compared to other states, but change on this metric is slow to achieve. .\nThe high school completion rates of different racial and ethnic groups vary widely. Although these disparities exist in other states, they are particularly important for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminority-majority\\xe2\\x80\\x9d state like Texas.

The new 15-year plan, 60x30TX, began in 2015, building on the goals and results of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClosing the Gaps\\xe2\\x80\\x9d plan. .\nIn 2005, 50 percent of all Texas high school graduates entered college in the summer or fall immediately after high school graduation. This increased to 54 percent in 2009, but steadily declined each year from 2010-2017, falling back to 50 percent by 2017 where it has roughly remained. .\nWhile the percentage of White students who enroll immediately after high school still exceeds the percentage of non-Whites, this gap is closing. There was a 16-percentage point gap between White students and Hispanic students in 2005. This shrank to three percentage points in 2019 due both to rising college enrollment rates among Hispanic students and unfortunately dropping rates among White students. The gap between African-American and White students has also been closing. The straight-to-college pathway traditionally results in higher postsecondary attainment rates compared to delaying college entry after high school graduation. .\n * Includes only Texas high school graduates who enrolled in a Texas public or private, nonprofit college or university.

By completing the FAFSA, students and their families have access to more financial options and can make more informed decisions about attending college. .\nTexas became the second state in the nation to require high school seniors to submit a FAFSA application before graduating, with the requirement currently set to go into effect in the 2021-2022 school year. Louisiana started requiring this step last year and has since ranked first among states in FAFSA completion, experiencing a 25 percent increase over the previous year. Illinois has also passed a law requiring FAFSA completion for high school graduation, and many other states are considering similar requirements. While Texas hopes to see a boost in FAFSA completion like Louisiana saw, the pandemic may impede the promise of this legislation in the short-term. .\nThe statewide FAFSA completion rate was 59 percent in fall 2020 and varied from 54 percent in the East Texas region to 66 percent in the Rio Grande Valley region. Many Texas communities promote FAFSA completion to encourage college enrollment, which, in turn, strengthens the skills in their local labor markets. The Rio Grande Valley region, a close-knit community, has been successful in their efforts. Many of the high schools have college admissions specialists on campus, and FAFSA completion work is championed by district leadership. .\n * Fall 2020 represents the class of 2019-2020 high school seniors completing the FAFSA as of September 25, 2020.

To meet TSI standards, students either score high enough on an approved TSI assessment or complete an approved TSI exemption (e.g., scoring above a threshold on the SAT, ACT, or TAKS tests, or completing college-level coursework). Students who do not meet TSI standards may be required to complete developmental coursework \\xe2\\x80\\x93 courses that often do not count towards a certificate or degree program \\xe2\\x80\\x93 before enrolling in college-credit courses. .\nOf all 2016-17 high school graduates who enrolled in higher education the following fall, 61 percent met TSI standards in math, writing, and reading. However, the percentages of high school students who met all TSI standards varied widely when comparing key characteristics. Students who enrolled in higher education after completing the minimum high school diploma program were far less likely to meet TSI standards than students who completed the College Prep* diploma. Sixty-four percent of students in the College Prep diploma program met all TSI standards, compared to just 16 percent of those completing the minimum diploma program. .\nLow-income high school graduates were also less academically prepared for college than their peers. Fifty percent of students who received free or reduced-price meals in high schools \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a common, though imperfect, metric to identify low-income students \\xe2\\x80\\x93 met all TSI standards. In contrast, 70 percent of students who did not receive free or reduced-price meals met all TSI standards. College readiness measures also varied based on student demographics. Seventy-three percent of White students met all TSI standards, compared to 54 percent of Hispanic students and 44 percent of African-American students. .\n * A high school student who graduates under either the Recommended or Distinguished achievement program is considered to have a College Prep diploma for the purposes of this analysis, and a graduate of the Foundation or Minimum achievement program is considered a Minimum program. The Recommended and Distinguished programs require more completed credits (26) in mathematics, science, social studies, language other than English, and fine arts than the minimum program. The Minimum program has fewer required completed credits (22).

A climate-driven heat wave helped create conditions for the fire to burn out of control. Scientists warn that humans are running out of time to curb greenhouse gas emissions and avoid catastrophic global warming. Thodoris Nikolaou/AP .\nGlobal climate change is accelerating and human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases are the overwhelming cause, according to a landmark report released Monday by the United Nations. There is still time to avoid catastrophic warming this century, but only if countries around the world stop burning fossil fuels as quickly as possible, the authors warn.\n\""It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change,\"" says Ko Barrett, the vice chair of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the senior adviser for climate at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \""Each of the last four decades has been the warmest on record since preindustrial times.\"".\nThe authors \\xe2\\x80\\x94 nearly 200 leading climate scientists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hope the report\\'s findings will be front and center when world leaders meet for a major climate conference in November.\nThe effects of that warming are obvious and deadly around the world. Heat waves, droughts and floods are killing people and disrupting lives around the world this summer. Wildfires are burning with unprecedented frequency and intensity, including in places that used to rarely burn. Smoke and smog are choking people in cities and towns from Asia to the Arctic. Ocean heat waves are threatening entire ecosystems and supercharging hurricanes and typhoons.\nOne of the biggest recent advances in climate research is in the field of so-called attribution science, which ties global warming to individual weather events such as hurricanes or heat waves. Scientists can now say with certainty that humans are causing more extreme weather, including heavy downpours and extended heat waves and droughts.\n\""This whiplash \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this increase in both extreme wet and dry events \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is projected to increase through the 21st century,\"" says Kim Cobb, one of the report authors and a paleoclimate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology.\nThis is the first time that paleoclimate researchers, who study the climate of the past to understand how Earth will change in the future, have helped write every chapter of the report. Their work helps put today\\'s climate in perspective. \""We can now say global surface temps are reaching levels not seen in 100,000 years,\"" says Cobb. \""The rate of warming since 1970 is higher than any 50-year period in the last 2,000 years.\"".\nThe report also confirms that global sea level rise is accelerating. Globally, sea levels rose about 8 inches on average between 1901 and 2018, although the water rose much more in some places, including in some cities on the East Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States.\nSea level rise is primarily driven by melting glaciers, and Arctic ice. There\\'s a lag between emissions and ice melting, which means even if humans were to stop all greenhouse gas emissions today, sea levels would continue to rise for a few decades , the report notes.\n\""Sea level change through the middle of this century has largely been locked in,\"" says Bob Kopp, one of the report\\'s authors and the director of the Institute of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Rutgers University. That means no matter what, people living in coastal areas will need to adapt to higher seas.\n Heavy rain caused severe flooding in July in China\\'s Henan province. Scientists say human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are causing more extreme precipitation in many parts of the world. Dake Kang/AP hide caption toggle caption Dake Kang/AP .\nHeavy rain caused severe flooding in July in China\\'s Henan province. Scientists say human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are causing more extreme precipitation in many parts of the world. Dake Kang/AP Scientists say it\\'s not too late.\nDespite the disastrous descriptions of our hotter Earth, the new report also makes clear that it is not too late to curb global warming. The more humans reduce emissions this decade, the more livable Earth will be for the rest of this century and for many centuries to come.\nOne of the big questions posed by world leaders is whether it\\'s still possible to meet the targets set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. That agreement seeks to limit global warming to well under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F). Earth is already about 1 degree Celsius hotter than it was in the late 1800s.\nMost of the biggest economies in the world are not on track to meet those temperature targets because they continue to rely too heavily on fossil fuels for electricity, transportation and industry \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including most polluting fuels such as coal. That includes the U.S. , which has cut emissions very slowly in recent years.\nThe new report finds that it is still possible to meet the targets set under the Paris agreement, but it gets more difficult with every passing day. The authors used five theoretical scenarios to predict future global warming. The scenarios include different levels of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as economic and population growth and political collaboration. Under all five scenarios, Earth hits 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next two decades.\n\""Is it still possible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees [Celsius]? The answer is yes,\"" says Maisa Rojas Corradi, a report author and climate scientist at the University of Chile. \""But unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions of all greenhouse gases, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees will be beyond reach.\"".\nThe authors found that if countries around the world dramatically and permanently cut emissions immediately, Earth will start getting cooler around the middle of this century. On the other hand, if countries move more slowly to curb emissions or fail to transition to cleaner sources of energy, Earth could warm by 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees F) or more by the end of the century.\n\""I think a key message here is that it is still possible to forestall most of the most dire impacts, but it really requires unprecedented, transformational change,\"" says Barrett, the IPCC vice chair. \""But the idea that there still is a pathway forward I think is a point that should give us some hope.\"".\n Eastman Lake in Madera County, Calif., was holding just one-fifth of its usual water volume in June.

Noah Berger/AP hide caption toggle caption Noah Berger/AP .\nEastman Lake in Madera County, Calif., was holding just one-fifth of its usual water volume in June. An extreme drought is unfolding this summer in the Western U.S., exacerbated by climate change. Noah Berger/AP Climate change is global, but solutions are local.\nThis is the sixth edition of the IPCC\\'s climate science report, and it is the first time scientists have broken down their findings and predictions by region. That\\'s a big deal because many countries rely on such reports to understand what the future will look like for their citizens and which policies make the most sense.\nFor example, the pace of sea level rise varies dramatically depending on where you live. Governments need regional information to decide where to build new infrastructure and how to protect existing coastal cities. The same is true for drought and flooding from rainstorms, which disrupt agriculture and drinking water supplies. Major cities including Cape Town, South Africa , and Chennai, India , have struggled to maintain reservoirs in recent years.\n\""It\\'s very important that this report gives regional information that is going to help us make decisions at the regional level,\"" says Paola Arias, one of the report authors and a climate scientist at the University of Antioquia in Colombia.\nWhen it comes to adaptation, the U.S. relies less on the specific information in this report because the federal government regularly releases national climate assessments . However, the U.N. report does provide important global context for the Biden administration\\'s promise to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade.\n\""The target that the Biden-Harris administration articulated earlier this year is the most ambitious ever in U.S. history,\"" says Jane Lubchenco, the deputy director for climate and environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. \""This report is telling us we need to be ambitious. We probably need to be even more so.\"".\nIt\\'s unclear how the U.S. will achieve the goal it has already set, let alone an accelerated goal. The infrastructure package Congress is currently considering includes some investments in cleaner electricity, public transit and electric appliances and vehicles. Meanwhile, other major economies including China and India are not on track to reduce their emissions this decade. ."", ""evidence"": ""That\\'s a big deal because many countries rely on such reports to understand what the future will look like for their citizens and which policies make the most sense."", ""nli_class"": ""neutral"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.9997943""}, {""snippet"": ""Personalize both the impact and the resolution.

Once his boss made clear that he would have the opportunity for continuing formal and informal discussions, the manager kept himself in check and was able to offer specific suggestions to improve implementation. .\nAlso, take pains to coordinate announcements so that no one is caught flat-footed if the news is being released at different intervals by individual managers and organization-wide outlets. It may feel like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\u00a0overinvesting in planning, but it will save you time and pain in the long run. Giving people multiple opportunities to take in and process the announcement is essential for thorough understanding; receiving the information from the right sources in the right sequence is crucial for credibility. .\nEquip all levels of management to explain the context. Provide training and rehearsal or role-play time to everyone who will need to communicate the message; don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t assume they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have the right instincts. Otherwise, to escape their own discomfort, they may dump the news or blame management, either directly or indirectly. You and Your Team Series Becoming a Manager.\nOne client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive team had to do significant repair when frontline managers announced to their teams that there would be a cutback in bonuses because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey said you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than explaining the reasons for the results and the plans already under way to improve those results for the future. Employees who had worked as hard as they could were frustrated and resentful, and were untrusting of senior management for some time thereafter.\nDescribe the organizational pain, and how the new solution alleviates it. Instead of just announcing a disruptive change, give the background of what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not working today and why the new plan is the best way to get to the desired outcome. Focus on how customers have been hurt, how the business is incurring extra expense, the negative brand impact \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and how the change will help mitigate those problems. When one client had to consolidate multiple operations to increase efficiency and reduce time to market, it was clear that there wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be room for all the incumbent leaders. It helped to review the shared history and the acknowledged pain points.\nPersonalize both the impact and the resolution. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, employees may not understand which specifics apply to them, or even how the company is providing support or services to help them cope. For example, in the small group or individual meetings, come prepared with all the necessary details to be able to answer personal questions immediately, rather than creating even more anxiety and aggravation while you assign someone to work out the specifics you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t research in advance. When one client changed\u00a0its health plans to keep costs down,\u00a0it helped covered employees research their doctors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 eligibility and find new practitioners when necessary. The employees were grateful for the individual attention and support, and were subsequently less resentful even though items\u00a0such as deductibles and co-pays had gotten more expensive.\nGive the affected people as many options and as much participation as you can. When they have choices \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and the necessary information or support to make them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 employees feel more respected and maintain more pride and autonomy. The closer people are to the work, the more likely it is that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll generate practical ideas. At one organization that was having some financial difficulties, we facilitated a series of meetings about cost-cutting measures that let everyone look for ways to help out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 even though they were adversely affected by some of the very measures they proposed.\nAnd don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t assume you know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best for each individual or what they might choose. When a client company was absorbed into a larger operating unit, some deeply committed HR executives stayed till the bitter end, providing outplacement for their colleagues despite knowing that by the time they looked for jobs themselves, the best opportunities would already have been filled.\nDemonstrate humility and responsibility, not just authority. Many leaders mistakenly believe that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be given a pass for shaking up people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives if they say they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re suffering over the decision or the disruption themselves. Even treating the problem as a shared responsibility can backfire and feel manipulative to employees. Instead, say things like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t anticipate\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was too enthusiastic about x\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to show that you take seriously the impact of the situation on others. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prepare for every curveball, so if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the answer to a question, say something like, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWow, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a question we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think about, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good one. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get back to everyone with an answer early next week.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to fake your way through.\nYou can use this kind of planned\u00a0approach to get the most mileage out of your organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good news,\u00a0recognizing\u00a0that everyone won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily perceive the good news as being good for them personally. It can feel unnecessarily painstaking to take the time to plan and then work through all the details with your employees. But knowing you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done everything you could to help them withstand challenges and move ahead will make it much more satisfying when you finally achieve the desired results. \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t.\nAccelerate your career with Harvard ManageMentor\u00ae.

No margin of error, among the polls that provide them, would be large enough to deliver the 94% that Trump claimed.\nTrump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval among Republicans has generally held in the mid-to-high 80s, which would qualify as robust.

Bush, who held a 94% approval rating within his party, as did his father George H.W. Bush. Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon brought up the rear, getting the nod from just 79% of Republican voters in May of their third year in office.

Not only have other presidents in the recent past enjoyed higher numbers, but there is no data from Lincoln\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time. That is pure invention.\nFor real record-setting, look to George W.

Trump State Park?"", ""full_text"": "" Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy. We need your help. .\n A sign at the entrance to Donald J. Trump State Park in New York in 2008 (Alan Kroeger, Wikimedia Commons) .\n\u2022 Some New York state legislators are urging officials to rename Donald J. Trump State Park, whose legacy as president is controversial in his home state. .\n\u2022 When Trump donated the land for the park in 2006, his lawyers sent the Parks Department a letter with instructions on naming it after him. Whether this constitutes a binding agreement is now in dispute. .\nEven after officially decamping for Palm Beach, Fla., former President Donald Trump has continued to stir emotions in his previous home state of New York.\nNew York Assemblywoman Sandy Galef, a Democrat, said she believes a park currently named for Trump north of New York City should be renamed. Trump donated the land for the park, and it was agreed at the time it would be named after him.\nIn a Jan. 14 letter to Erik Kulleseid, the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Commissioner in New York, Galef wrote, \""It is my understanding that Mr. Trump did not sign the appropriate documents with the state, rendering any claim of breach of contract moot. We can and should rename the park.\"".\nIn an interview, Galef added that the park \""really hasn\u2019t been fixed up\"" and that efforts to do so would be hobbled by having Trump\u2019s name on it. Galef said she believes the park should instead be named after former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican.\n\""Around this area, when you have \u2018Trump\u2019 on the name of something, it doesn\u2019t go over very well,\"" Galef said. \""My concern is that people aren\u2019t going to want to put money into Trump Park, whether it\u2019s state dollars or any private dollars.\"".\nGalef has support in her quest to rename the park: On Feb. 11, a bill advanced in the Assembly to continue talks on renaming the park.\nBut the former president may pursue litigation against the state if the Parks Department decides to rename the park, a Trump spokesman said.\n\""Despite the fact that the state has done a horrible job running and maintaining the park in question, an utter disgrace to such incredible land and a generous donation, the conditions of this gift, formally documented and accepted by the state of New York, could not be clearer: the park must bear Trump\u2019s name,\"" Trump\u2019s office said in a statement. \""This would be breaching its agreement by removing Trump\u2019s name, and Trump will take whatever legal action that may be necessary to fully enforce his rights under this agreement.\"".\nIs Galef right that New York state could change the name without too much difficulty? The answer isn\u2019t clear enough for us to render a Truth-O-Meter verdict. But we decided to take a look at the issue and explain what we found.\nDonald J. Trump State Park sits on the border of Putnam and Westchester counties along the Taconic Parkway. Trump gave the land to New York State in 2006 after the former president failed in building a golf course on it.\nThe land deed for the property does not include any naming provisions, but the state named the park after Trump based on a letter of agreement between the Parks Department and Trump\u2019s lawyers.\nThe letter outlined several terms, one of which is the following: \""Each of the properties will bear a name which includes Mr. Trump\u2019s name, in acknowledgment of these gifts. The name will be prominently displayed at least at each entrance to each property.\"".\nThe letter includes signatures by Trump\u2019s lawyers and by Trump himself, and it was \""acknowledged and accepted\"" by James Sponable, who was then the Parks Department\u2019s director of real property.\nThe New York State Attorney General\u2019s office referred questions about the park\u2019s possible renaming to the Parks Department. The Parks Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\""The land is called a gift, so this seems to be memorializing the terms of a gift,\"" David Reiss, a real estate law specialist at Brooklyn Law School, told PolitiFact. \""So, one question is, \u2018What\u2019s the enforceability of this letter?\u2019 It\u2019s not obvious to me that this would be analyzed as a contractual dispute.\"".\nReiss said because the letter does not clearly state that it is a binding contract, it is unclear how a court would treat it if the state were to rename the park and Trump legally challenged it.\n\""The letter says, \u2018We have this understanding,\u2019 but it doesn\u2019t say what would happen if the understanding isn\u2019t held to,\"" Reiss said. \""It doesn\u2019t say what would happen if, at some later time, it changed. There is no promise that the naming would be perpetual. So it\u2019s unclear what Trump\u2019s rights would be to enforce this based on the language of this document.\"".\nUltimately, Reiss said, \""the one sure thing is there could be a lot of litigation about these issues, if the parties chose to litigate.\"".\nAs an alternative, Galef said Trump\u2019s name could be removed from a sign on the Taconic Parkway, which is the most common way for motorists to see it. The letter \""doesn\u2019t say you have to have a sign on the Taconic Parkway, ... That could come down,\"" Galef said in the interview.\n\""The sign on the Taconic is not the entrance of the park, so you could comply with the letter and still take that sign down,\"" he said. \""It might be confusing to people if you say, \u2018Unnamed State Park, next right,\"" but if you stuck to the black letter of this letter, you could say, \u2018Right at the entrance of the park is where we\u2019re going to put the sign, but nowhere before.\u2019\"" .\n Says Nate McMurray said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe NRA are homegrown terrorists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabortion opponents are the American Taliban.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported COVID-19 case.

And 2020 had already set an all-time high for state park attendance. .\n\u2022 An expert said the record figure may have to do with people wanting to be together outside during the pandemic. .\nIn a late January press release, New York State Sen. Rob Ortt touted the attendance figures at New York state parks during 2021.\n\""With the ongoing pandemic, our State Park attendance is at the highest it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever been,\"" Ortt said in a Jan. 22 press release . In the press release, Ortt was urging Gov. Kathy Hochul and Erik Kulleseid, commissioner of the state office of parks, recreation, and historic preservation to end a hiring freeze for park police.\nOrtt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement caught our eye because many types of travel have been reduced since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.\nOrtt made the statement before Hochul publicly announced the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new park attendance figures. In a subsequent press release , Hochul said that New York state parks had hit record-high attendance levels in 2021, breaking the record set during the previous year, 2020. (The state lists attendance at state parks on its website going back to 2003.).\nNew York state parks had more than 78.4 million visitors in 2021, an increase of just over 427,000 from the 2020 level of just over 78 million. In turn, the 2020 figure increased by about 910,000 over the 2019 level.\nPark attendance has increased consistently in recent years. In fact the state has not seen an annual decrease in park attendance since 2013.\\xc2\\xa0.\nThat said, the annual increases during the pandemic were smaller than the increases prior to the pandemic. For instance, between 2018 and 2019, the state parks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attendance increased by over 2.9 million visitors, year over year. And between 2017 and 2018, state park attendance increased by over 2.6 million visitors.\\xc2\\xa0.\nMeasures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 are believed to have kept state park attendance increasing during the pandemic, which began in March 2020.\\xc2\\xa0.\nJason Schnittker , a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, said he believes parks allowed people to socialize while feeling safe from getting infected.\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""State parks are open-air, inexpensive, large and easy to social distance within, and very attractive in summer, fall, winter, and spring. At some point, the urge to get out of the house was overwhelming,\"" Schnittker said. \""I also suspect many people went to parks with someone else \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as in an appropriately social distanced social event \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and social support is very good for mental and physical health. It\\'s not good to be isolated in your apartment all the time.\"".\nHe added that the increase in attendance provided multiple benefits. \""Getting out in nature can be very relaxing, even for those who are not outdoor enthusiasts,\"" he said. \""The other dimension is exercise. Even moderate exercise, like walking or hiking, is good for your health.\"".\nOfficial numbers show that New York state park attendance hit a record in 2021, after hitting a record in 2020.

McMurray did tweet about \""the most insecure and dangerous club\"" last year, but Jacobs suggested that McMurray had targeted a broader group of gun owners for that description.\nJacobs was referring to an Aug. 3, 2019, tweet in which McMurray said, \""YOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world.\"".\nYOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world. August 4, 2019.\nMcMurray \""specifically referenced assault-style weapons in his tweet,\"" she said. \""While Nate is a gun owner, he was also conveying the fact that owning an assault rifle doesn\\'t make one a \\xe2\\x80\\x98man.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xc2\\xa0 His vision for America does not include assault weapons.\"".\nSoon after, Jacobs said that McMurray had \""said the NRA are homegrown terrorists.\"" (The NRA is the National Rifle Association, a prominent pro-gun group.).\nOn March 8, 2018, McMurray tweeted a response to a video advertisement from NRATV , an NRA affiliate, that featured conservative commentator Dana Loesch holding a large hourglass.\\xc2\\xa0.\nIn his tweeted response, McMurray wrote, \""If ISIS made a video as threatening as the NRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hourglass offering, we would all be legitimately freaked out. Who is behind this \\xe2\\x80\\x98genius\\xe2\\x80\\x99 marketing? Are they channeling Margaret Hamilton in the Wizard of Oz?

(McMurray) did not say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98the NRA is a terrorist organization.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\"".\nJacobs said, \""I am pro-life; (McMurray) is pro-abortion. He said abortion opponents are the American Taliban. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another tweet of Nate McMurray.\"".\nOn July 3, 2018, McMurray tweeted , \""DO THE MATH: 67% of the public is pro choice according to recent polls. Only 2 Republican members of Congress are pro-choice. 1 President actually said he wants to PUNISH women for abortion. Forget Democracy, forget mental health, act like the Taliban and PUNISH women.

But if the accusation is that Nate does not believe women should be punished for getting an abortion, that is correct.\"".\nJacobs said McMurray had said that \""gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth,\"" that \""the NRA are homegrown terrorists,\"" and that \""abortion opponents are the American Taliban.\"".\nIn each case, McMurray did tweet something very close to what Jacobs cited in the debate, although sometimes with slightly different wording from what Jacobs used. The biggest divergence was in the first of these claims, in which McMurray was referring to people who own assault weapons rather than gun owners more generally.\n Says Nate McMurray said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe NRA are homegrown terrorists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabortion opponents are the American Taliban.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome states, like Montana and Nebraska, are getting more than $300,000 in federal stimulus money per reported  ...evidence too long",0

Think about it - something is always being built somewhere.\nThe industry is almost untouchable. While many construction companies lost revenue due to the pandemic, they still made enough to keep going strong. In fact, these companies were deemed as essential and were allowed to operate even when the world was shut down.\nSo what makes the construction industry so successful? The statistics below will put this industry into perspective for you. How big is the construction industry?.\nThe industry has an estimated CAGR of 7.4% over the next few years. Every sector of the industry has a positive forecast.\nThere are four main sectors in the construction industry: residential, commercial, specialized industrial, and infrastructure and heavy construction. Residential accounts for over 40% of the entire construction industry revenue.\nThe Asia-Pacific area has the largest share of the global construction market at 42% in 2020. The United States has the second largest share at 10.8% - not even half of what the Asia-Pacific area brings in.\nConstruction companies all over the world are experiencing decreased profit margins due to the rising costs in materials as well as the labor shortage. For example, crude oil rose as high as 43% and cement prices rose as high as 2.5 percent. Top Causes Of Death In Construction (2018) Falls: Falling objects: Electrocution: electrocution Caught-in/Compressed by equipment:.\n Top Causes Of Deaths In Construction \\t\\t\\t\\t Percent \\t\\t\\t\\t Falls 33.5% Falling objects 11.1% Electrocution 8.5% Caught-in/Compressed by equipment 5.5% .\nSafety in the construction industry is a big global concern since fatalities tend to be higher in this industry than many others. In fact, the construction industry has the third highest rate of fatalities in the world.\nAround 34% of construction-related fatalities are due to falls. These falls are often preventable. A lot of these deaths could be reduced if workers simply followed safety policies.\nThe \""Fatal Four\"" account for more than 60% of construction-related deaths. The four areas are falls, electrocution, being struck by an object, or being caught in, under, or in-between objects. Safety on construction sites is a hot topic of debate in all countries since the injury and fatality rates are so high.\nCrane malfunctions are a major cause of deaths in the construction industry. In 2017, there were 33 crane related deaths in the United States. Around 79% of these involved an object falling from a crane. Chapter 2: United States Construction Industry Statistics.\nWhile the United States doesn't have the top construction industry in the world, the American industry still brings in a phenomenal amount of money and provides a solid share of jobs for the American citizens.\nThe industry has seen steady growth over many years and didn't suffer too much from the pandemic. The salary in the industry is great and the overall outlook on the industry is positive. How big is the construction industry in the U.S?.\nThis may not seem like a lot, but when you consider the fact that there are 69 industries in the U.S. you can understand why that number is a good number. The construction industry is the 13th largest industry in the United States.\nThe largest industry in the United States is real estate. The real estate industry could not exist without the construction industry. As long as the real estate industry continues to thrive, the construction industry will stay strong. Construction Spending Data.\n States With The Most Construction Spending \\t\\t\\t\\t Amount Of Spending ($) \\t\\t\\t\\t Texas $45.4 billion New York $32.1 billion California $24.8 billion Florida $23 billion Pennsylvania $12.6 billion Top 5 States With The Least Construction Spending (2019) $298 million $363 million $449 million $532 million $654 million.\n States With The Least Construction Spending \\t\\t\\t\\t Amount Of Spending ($) \\t\\t\\t\\t Wyoming $298 million Vermont $363 million Alaska $449 million Montana $532 million West Virginia $654 million Construction Dispute Statistics.\nThe average length of construction disputes in North America was 17.6 months, with the average value of construction disputes at $18.8 million in 2019.\nInterestingly, the most common construction dispute case was listed as contractor/subcontractor \""failing to understand and/or comply\"" with a contractual obligation in 2019. Around 11% of the construction workers in the United States are female.\nThere are scholarships and awards that are specifically for women going into construction. Unfortunately there is simply a slim pool of women who want to go into the construction industry. Around 44% of women in the construction industry are in management or other professional positions.\nThat leaves the last 28% to fill the hands-on positions. With the pool of women in the industry already being as slim as it is, it's almost impossible to make sure every construction job is diverse when it comes to gender.\n Roles Of Women In Construction \\t\\t\\t\\t Percent \\t\\t\\t\\t Management Or Professional Positions 44% Sales Or Office Positions 28% Hands-on Positions 28% On average, women make around 99% of what men make in construction.\nThere are a few theories as to why a gender pay gap is not a problem in the construction industry. The first is that the industry desperately needs workers so companies are offering everyone top notch pay.\nThe second is that there are so few women in the industry that a difference in wages would likely be very noticeable. The third is that women simply aren't settling for less. Most construction workers are white.\nThe Hispanic population has grown significantly over the past couple of decades and now they are the second most populous race in the country.\nAfrican-Americans are the third most populous race in the United States. The percentages below reflect the demographics of the population. Breakdown of Construction Workers by Race:.\n Construction Workers By Race \\t\\t\\t\\t Percent \\t\\t\\t\\t White 58.7% Hispanic/Latin American 24.5% Black/African American 10.7% As of 2021, the U.S. state with the most construction jobs is California.\nThis state also has the highest construction revenue of any other state. Texas comes in second and Florida comes in third. These are the three most populous states in the U.S. which could be why they have the most construction jobs.\nOver 60% of the total construction revenue is spread across only ten states. These states are the three mentioned above, plus Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina, and New York.\nVermont has the least amount of revenue from the construction industry. New Hampshire comes in next to least. The highest paying states in the construction industry are Hawaii with an average of $35.08 per hour, Illinois with an average of $33.86 per hour, and Massachusetts with an average of $32.65 per hour.\n Highest Paying States For Construction Workers \\t\\t\\t\\t Hourly Rate \\t\\t\\t\\t Hawaii $35.08 per hour Illinois $33.86 per hour Massachusetts $32.65 per hour In 2020, $9.15 billion was spent on building new public housing.\nAs the pandemic took its' toll on Americans, some people found themselves moving into public housing. This migration into public housing increased the demand and triggered strong growth in the residential construction sector. Chapter 3: Great Britain Construction Industry Statistics.\nLabor shortages and increased pricing for materials stalled the industry's progress which means they lost money, but they are making a comeback.\nAs more attention is given to the industry by the government, it's making it's way back to being progressively successful. Construction revenues in Great Britain reached a record high of \\xc2\\xa3119,087 million ($161.42 billion) in 2019.\nDespite the drop in revenue in 2020, the number of Value Added Tax (VAT)/Pay As You Earn (PAYE) construction firms increased by 2 percent. At the end of 2020, there were 342,456 registered construction companies in Great Britain.\nOver the last few years, the overall number of employees in the construction industry held relatively steady. However, the number of self-employed construction workers decreased.\nWhen separating the construction industry into sectors, new private housing and new private commercial structures contributed over 75% of the total construction revenue in 2020. The private infrastructure sector revenue increased by \\xc2\\xa31,571 million ($2.13 billion).\nPrivate infrastructure was the only sector that grew. In fact, this sector saw its highest historical revenue. Around 51% of construction companies in the U.K. participate in green construction projects.\nChina has been the world leader in the construction industry for a long time, but the pandemic toll on the Chinese economy. Despite this, China is bouncing back and keeping it's position in the construction industry. Check out the statistics below. In 2020, Chinese construction companies saw a profit of \\xc2\\xa5\\xe2\\x80\\x8e818.7 billion ($129.16 billion).\nThe Chinese construction industry (and almost all Chinese industries) were among the hardest hit industries during the pandemic. However, they finally opened back up and have been doing great job of getting back to their former glory. As China bounced back from the pandemic, new construction contracts were put into play in 2021.\nThese contracts valued over \\xc2\\xa5\\xe2\\x80\\x8e32.5 trillion ($5.13 trillion). This is what helped to jumpstart their construction industry after the shut downs. The average value of construction equipment in China is over \\xc2\\xa5\\xe2\\x80\\x8e525 billion ($82.82 bill ...evidence too long",0

The date was May 1st, 1999, at the NRA \u2019s national convention in Denver. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold\u2019s rampage at Columbine High School in nearby Littleton, Colorado, had just killed 13 students and teachers, shocking the conscience of the nation. .\nThe disconnect between the NRA chief\u2019s conciliatory address on that day 14 years ago and his combative press conference in the aftermath of the slaughter of 20 first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut, could hardly be more jarring. In his now-infamous December 21st tirade, LaPierre ripped the gun-free zones he once championed as an invitation to the \u201cmonsters and predators of this world,\u201d advertising to \u201cevery insane killer in America that schools are their safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk.\u201d .\nLaPierre then offered what he called a \u201cproven\u201d solution to school gun violence \u2013 one that would open a lucrative new market for the gun industry while tidily expanding the power of the NRA itself. \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\u201d LaPierre insisted, before proposing that armed, NRA-trained vigilantes should patrol each of the nation\u2019s nearly 100,000 public schools. .\n \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\\t\\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t .\n \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\t\\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t .\n \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\\t\\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t .\n \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 100 Best Albums of 2022\\t\\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t .\nThe shift in LaPierre\u2019s rhetoric underscores a radical transformation within the NRA. Billing itself as the nation\u2019s \u201coldest civil rights organization,\u201d the NRA still claims to represent the interests of marksmen, hunters and responsible gun owners. But over the past decade and a half, the NRA has morphed into a front group for the firearms industry, whose profits are increasingly dependent on the sale of military-bred weapons like the assault rifles used in the massacres at Newtown and Aurora, Colorado. \u201cWhen I was at the NRA, we said very specifically, \u2018We do not represent the fi rearm industry,\\'\u201d says Richard Feldman, a longtime gun lobbyist who left the NRA in 1991. \u201cWe represent gun owners. End of story.\u201d But in the association\u2019s more recent history, he says, \u201cThey have really gone after the gun industry.\u201d .\nToday\u2019s NRA stands astride some of the ugliest currents of our politics, combining the \u201castroturf\u201d activism of the Tea Party, the unlimited and undisclosed \u201cdark money\u201d of groups like Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS, and the sham legislating conducted on behalf of the industry through groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council. \u201cThis is not your father\u2019s NRA,\u201d says Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, a top gun-industry watchdog. Feldman is more succinct, calling his former employer a \u201ccynical, mercenary political cult.\u201d .\nThe NRA\u2019s alignment with an $11.7 billion industry has fed tens of millions of dollars into the association\u2019s coffers, helping it string together victories that would have seemed fantastic just 15 years ago. The NRA has hogtied federal regulators, censored government data about gun crime and blocked renewal of the ban on assault weaponry and high-capacity magazines, which expired in 2004. The NRA secured its \u201cnumber-one legislative priority\u201d in 2005, a law blocking liability lawsuits that once threatened to bankrupt gunmakers and expose the industry\u2019s darkest business practices. Across the country, the NRA has opened new markets for firearms dealers by pushing for state laws granting citizens the right to carry hidden weapons in public and to allow those who kill in the name of self-defense to get off scot-free. .\n \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'Not Going to Fix It' Lawmaker Now Says 'Repenting Sins' Only Solution to School Shootings\\t\\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t .\n \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNikki Haley Says Focusing on Gun Control Is a 'Lazy' Approach to Gun Violence\\t\\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t .\n \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTucker Carlson Claims \\xe2\\x80\\x98Trans Movement Is Targeting Christians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Amid Calls for\\xc2\\xa0Gun Control\\xc2\\xa0\\t\\t \\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t\\t .\nT he NRA\u2019s unbending opposition to better gun-control measures does not actually reflect the views of the nation\u2019s gun owners or, for that matter, its claimed 4 million members. A May 2012 poll conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz revealed surprising moderation on behalf of NRA members: Three out of four believed that background checks should be completed before every gun purchase. Nearly two-thirds supported a requirement that gun owners alert police when their firearms are lost or stolen. \u201cTheir members are much more rational than the management of the NRA,\u201d New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, co-chair of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, tells Rolling Stone . \u201cThey\u2019re out of touch.\u201d .\nThat\u2019s by design. Today\u2019s NRA is a completely top-down organization. It has been led since 1991 by LaPierre, its chief executive, who serves at the pleasure of a 76-member board that is all but self-perpetuating. Only one-third of the board\u2019s membership is up for re-election in any given year. Voting is limited to the NRA\u2019s honored \u201clifetime\u201d members and to dues-payers with at least five consecutive years of being in good standing. Write-in candidates occasionally pepper the ballot, but in practice, the tiny slice of eligible members who bother to vote rubber-stamp a slate of candidates dictated by the NRA\u2019s 10-member nominating committee \u2013 one of whose members is George Kollitides II, CEO of Freedom Group , which manufactures the Bushmaster semiautomatic that Adam Lanza used to slaughter children in Newtown. .\nThe NRA\u2019s board is stocked with industry brass . Pete Brownell, president of Brownells \u2013 an Internet arms superstore that features \u201cultrahigh-capacity magazines\u201d \u2013 campaigned for his seat touting the importance for the NRA to have \u201cdirectors who intimately understand and work in leadership positions within the firearms industry.\u201d Another board seat belongs to Ronnie Barrett, CEO of Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, whose company produces .50-caliber sniper rifles capable of piercing armor from nearly a mile away. Barrett\u2019s firm also sells scope-mounted ballistics computers that enable clueless civilians to hit targets like they were special-forces snipers. The ammunitions side of the industry finds a voice in board member Stephen Hornady, whose company peddles armor-piercing bullets and trades on the slogan \u201cAccurate. Deadly. Dependable.\u201d .\nThese NRA directors are representative of a firearms sector that knows lethality sells. \u201cThe industry has changed,\u201d says Tom Diaz, former Democratic counsel to the House subcommittee on crime, a longtime gun-violence policy analyst and author of a forthcoming book on the industry, The Last Gun . \u201cIn terms of what sells and what is marketed most successfully, we\u2019re now talking about guns that are derived directly from military design.\u201d .\nOf the top 15 gun manufacturers, 11 now manufacture assault weapons, many of them variants of the AR-15 \u2013 derived from a military rifle designed to kill enemy soldiers at close-to-medium range with little marksmanship. The industry loves these \u201cmodern sporting rifles\u201d because they can be tricked out with expensive scopes, loaders, lights and lasers. \u201cMost of the money is in accessories,\u201d says Feldman. .\nAs one gun rep recently boasted to an industry publication: \u201cThe AR platform is like Legos for grown men.\u201d And a 2012 report from Bushmaster\u2019s parent company boasted that the industry\u2019s embrace of these guns has led to \u201cincreased long-term growth in the long-gun market while attracting a younger generation of shooters.\u201d The campaign certainly seems to be working. Twenty-year-old Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster. Twenty-five-year-old James Holmes, the Aurora shooter, was in many ways the dream customer of the surging industry. He bought an AR-15 .233-caliberSmith & Wesson assault rifle \u2013 a category the company\u2019s CEO bragged was \u201cextremely hot\u201d \u2013 tricked it out with a 100-round ultrahigh-capacity magazine and then purchased thousands of rounds from BulkAmmo.com, spending nearly $15,000 on his greater arsenal. .\nThe changes in the industry are underscored by dispatches from industry websites and publications, like this one from Shooting Wire, in which the NRA is an advertiser: \u201cThe net of all the numbers is that if you\u2019re a company with a strong line of high-capacity pistols and AR-style rifles, you\u2019re doing land-office business. If you\u2019re heavily dependent on hunting, you are hurting.\u201d .\nT he NRA insists in its publications that it is \u201cnot a trade organization\u201d and that it is \u201cnot affiliated with any firearm or ammunition manufacturers or with any businesses that deal in guns and ammunition.\u201d That is a lie. NRA\u2019s corporate patrons include 22 firearms manufacturers, 12 of which are makers of assault weapons with household names like Beretta and Ruger, according to a 2011 analysis by the Violence Policy Center. The report, drawn from the NRA\u2019s own disclosures, also identified gifts from dozens of firms that profit from high-capacity magazines, including Browning and Remington. Donors from the industry and other dark reaches of the corporate world \u2013 including Xe, the new name of the mercenary group Blackwater \u2013 had funneled up to $52 million to the NRA in recent years. .\nMore disturbing, the NRA receives funds directly from the sales of arms and ammunition. The \u201cRound-Up\u201d program, launched by arms retailer Midway USA, encourages customers to increase their purchases to the nearest dollar and sends the extra coin to the association. Midway customers alone have contributed nearly $8 million in this way to support NRA\u2019s lobbying division, the Institute for Legislative Action. .\nIn 2011, Ruger set out to be the first gun company to \u201cbuild and ship a million guns in one year.\u201d So it ginned up a promotion that would give a dollar to the NRA for every weapon sold between the 2011 and 2012 NRA annual meetings. The company broke its own sales goal, sending $1,254,000 to the NRA-ILA . Glock \u2013 whose pistols have been used in at least six mass murders since 1991, including the Virginia Tech and Gabby Giffords shootings \u2013 has been shipping an offer for discounted NRA memberships with its handguns. In 2007, the NRA thanked Glock for helping it recruit 10,000 new members. .\nTop corporate patrons are treated like royalty. Those whose giving to the NRA reaches $1 million or more are inaugurated into an elite NRA society called the \u201cGolden Ring of Freedom\u201d in a ceremony where they\u2019re presented with a silk-lined golden blazer with a hand-embroidered crest. Industry honchos seen in \u201cthe million-dollar jacket\u201d include the heads of Ruger, Beretta, Midway and Cabela\u2019s, an outfitter that sells 12 models of semiautomatic rifles. .\nMuch like elite funders of a major political party, these Golden Ringers enjoy top access to decision-makers at the NRA. Their interests, not the interest of the $35-a-year member, rule the roost. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this base of true believers that they mail their magazines out to,\u201d says policy analyst Diaz. \u201cBut the NRA is really about serving this elite.\u201d .\nI n more than three decades of service to the NRA, Wayne LaPierre has done more than any other man alive to make America safe for crazed gunmen to build warlike arsenals and unleash terror on innocents at movie theaters and elementary schools. In the 1980s, he helped craft legislation to roll back gun control passed in the wake of the Kennedy and King assassinations. And since the late 1990s, twice he has destroyed political deals that might have made it hugely difficult for accused killers like Holmes and Lanza to get their hands on their weapons. .\nA predecessor once characterized the NRA as being \u201cone of the world\u2019s great religions,\u201d and 64-year-old LaPierre is a strange fit to be its pope. LaPierre did not come from gun culture. He wasn\u2019t a hunter, a marksman, a military man or a Second Amendment activist. \u201cHe\u2019s not a true believer,\u201d says NRA biographer Osha Gray Davidson. \u201cHe\u2019s the first NRA chief you can say that about.\u201d .\nAccording to NRA legend, LaPierre is actually a menace with a gun. NRA\u2019s PR team once thought it would be sexy to film LaPierre at a firing range. \u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d an NRA staffer told Davidson. LaPierre was aiming downrange for the camera when an engineer called for a sound check. To answer the man, LaPierre swung around, but he failed to lower his rifle, aiming it directly at the engineer \u2013 before someone took the gun away from LaPierre. The incident, terrifying at the time, became a dark joke at NRA headquarters. Staffers behind on their projects were threatened that they\u2019d have to \u201cgo hunting with Wayne.\u201d (The NRA\u2019s press office did not reply to Rolling Stone inquiries.) .\nBetween 1978, when LaPierre was hired as a lobbyist, and 1991, when he took over as CEO, the NRA had been on a historic roll. In those early days, LaPierre served at the knee of a revolutionary NRA executive named Harlon Carter, who transformed an old-time shooters club into a political powerhouse \u2013 an \u201cNRA so strong,\u201d Carter boasted, \u201cthat no politician in America mindful of his political career would want to challenge [our] goals.\u201d The NRA started grading politicians on guns \u2013 a process Bob Dole kvetched was \u201ca litmus test every five minutes\u201d \u2013 rewarding allies with campaign cash and subjecting foes to the backlash of millions of rabid, single-issue gun-owning voters. In 1980, the NRA made its first-ever presidential endorsement with Ronald Reagan, and by 1986 had the Gipper\u2019s signature on legislation, overseen by LaPierre, that would usher in a new era of unregulated gun shows. .\nBy the late 1990s, however, the once mighty NRA was reeling on LaPierre\u2019s watch: It had suffered stinging legislative defeats \u2013 the passage of the Brady Bill in 1993 and the Assault Weapons Ban a year later. Despite being credited by President Clinton for the GOP takeover in the House in 1994, the association was riven by factionalism and money troubles that had many writing the association\u2019s obituary. .\nInstead, LaPierre orchestrated a stunning turnaround, rebuilding the NRA\u2019s power, this time as the voice of the industry. In so doing, he destroyed a historic gun-control effort. .\nCities around the country, emboldened by the success of the legal action that had humbled Big Tobacco, had begun suing gun manufacturers, claiming that the industry was liable for the social costs of gun violence. These suits argued that firearms manufacturers had negligently marketed guns to criminals and profited from illicit gun sales by turning a blind eye to their distribution networks. The Clinton White House, in an initiative driven by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, announced its own class-action, suit over gun violence in the nation\u2019s housing projects. .\n\u201cThe liability fight was an existential threat to the firearms industry,\u201d says Feldman. \u201cThey thought that if those lawsuits continued, let alone were successful, it would drain the industry.\u201d In the industry\u2019s moment of peril, LaPierre saw an opportunity to expand the NRA\u2019s power: The NRA would get out in front of gunmakers and, through its membership, lead their fight. Charlton Heston, then NRA\u2019s president, brought a stark message to the industry\u2019s biggest trade show in 1999: \u201cFor a century, we have thrived independently,\u201d Heston said. \u201cBut now your fight has become our fight.\u201d Under LaPierre, the NRA went to work at the state level, securing bills that would ban localities from suing gun manufacturers. It also began to draw up a national campaign to get Congress to immunize gun manufacturers from liability for their deadly products. .\nSmith & Wesson, at the time America\u2019s biggest handgun manufacturer, was hesitant to bank on the NRA\u2019s legislative moonshot, deciding that the best way to limit the damage would be to negotiate a settlement with Cuomo. \u201cWe have to save the business,\u201d said CEO Ed Schultz.\u201d So we\u2019re talking, instead of hiding our head in the sand like the National Rifle Association.\u201d .\nIn exchange for immunity from product liability lawsuits, Smith & Wesson agreed to make safer guns and to clean up distribution networks. The measures included changes to the guns themselves, such as internal locks, triggers that couldn\u2019t be operated by kids and making new guns incompatible with old, high-capacity magazines whose manufacture was now illegal thanks to the Assault Weapons Ban. Smith & Wesson also promised to ship only to dealers who ran background checks at every sale, including at gun shows, and who refused to sell grandfathered assault rifles. With Smith & Wesson on board, Cuomo was confident that other manufacturers would fall in line. .\nBut LaPierre would tolerate no defections. Determined to kill off any comprehensive gun-control agreement, he decided to hurt Smith & Wesson like the NRA had punished so many wayward politicians, by riling up the membership and organizing a consumer boycott that left the company reeling. Cuomo\u2019s negotiations with the industry soon collapsed. .\nSo too did the effort to pass new gun restrictions in the aftermath of Columbine, underscoring the NRA\u2019s resurgent power. Three guns used in the Columbine massacre had been picked up at a gun show, where, thanks to a loophole in the Brady Bill, the purchases weren\u2019t subject to background checks. The Senate quickly passed an amendment to close the gun-show loophole, with Al Gore casting the decisive vote. But the NRA made its stand in the House. A month later, when the amendment came up for a vote, it got stomped, 193 to 235. Democrats, mindful of the punishment of 1994, contributed 49 nay votes. .\nThe dual defeats left Cuomo disillusioned. He gave a speech in June 2000 that was stunningly bleak. \u201cIf we engage the enemy in this town, we will lose,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will beat us in this town. They are too strong in this town. Their fortress is within the Beltway. \u201d .\nL aPierre had helped gunmakers dodge two bullets as the Clinton years drew to a close. But to lock in these gains, the NRA needed an ally in the White House. .\nThe NRA backed Bush to the hilt in the 2000 race. According to one tally, one in three dollars spent by outside groups to support the Bush ticket was spent by the NRA, and in the end Bush beat Gore among gun owners by 25 points. \u201cThe gun issue cost Al Gore the White House,\u201d says Feldman. \u201cForget the couple of hundred chads in Palm Beach. Absent the gun issue, he would have won Tennessee, Arkansas and West Virginia.\u201d .\nThe Bush administration rewarded the NRA as few could have imagined. Bush appointed NRA favorite John Ashcroft as attorney general, who, in May 2001, announced that for the first time in the nation\u2019s history the Justice Department had adopted the view, long championed by the NRA, that the Second Amendment confers an individual, not a collective, right to bear arms. .\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, when other constitutional protections were being trampled, nothing would shake this conviction, not even the fact that a jihadist training manual found in Afghanistan instructed Al Qaeda operatives living in the United States on how to, legally and without arousing suspicion, \u201cobtain an assault weapon, preferably an AK-47 or a variation.\u201d The Bush administration continued to press the NRA\u2019s expansive vision of the Second Amendment until it was even adopted by the Supreme Court in 2008. .\nIt wasn\u2019t only restrictions on the sale of military-grade weaponry that the NRA fought. It also fought to keep Americans in the dark about the relative dangers of such guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms compiles detailed records about what firearms are used in what types of crime, and even published a list of the top 10 crime guns. To block the release of that data, Todd Tiahrt, a GOP congressman from Kansas and an NRA ally, tacked a rider onto a 2003 appropriations bill that forbids ATF from spending any money to share the data it collects with the public \u2013 or even with Congress. \u201cIf you wanted to know how many Bushmasters have been used in what kinds of crime for the last five years, that information is in ATF\u2019s files,\u201d says Diaz. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be released because of the Tiahrt Amendment.\u201d .\nWith Bush in the White House and the public now blindered to the perils of semiautomatic weapons, the Assault Weapons Ban was on a glide path to expire in 2004. And the NRA, hellbent to free the gunmakers and dealers from any responsibility resulting from the use of these dangerous weapons, continued to press ahead in its fiercest fight: a federal bill immunizing the industry from liability. .\nIn 2004, the NRA had gathered its forces in the Senate and pushed them to bring a liability bill to the floor. A gun-control group, Americans for Gun Safety, made the decision that it was willing to stop fighting the bill, whose passage seemed all but certain, if it could somehow force the NRA to accept renewal of the Assault Weapons Ban and the closure of the gun-show loophole in the bargain. .\nThe compromise bill had a clear path to victory. The gun-control activists believed they\u2019d backed the NRA into a corner. Their thinking, says Jim Kessler, who directed policy for AFGS, was that the NRA would say, \u201cOK, we gotta take this because who knows what will happen in 2005. John Kerry could be president.\u201d .\nThen something extraordinary happened: The NRA blew up the deal, letting senators know that any votes for the bill would be recorded as votes against the NRA. \u201cYou could see them on the Senate floor looking at their BlackBerrys and changing their votes,\u201d says Kessler. The bill died by a vote of 8 to 90. .\nThis was becoming a pattern. Just as he\u2019d done by upending the White House settlement talks with the industry in the late 1990s, LaPierre had once again cut the bottom out of a hard-fought political compromise to impose meaningful gun restrictions. \u201cThere is not a middle ground with the NRA,\u201d says Diaz. Indeed, LaPierre had laid this strategy in a 2002 speech to his membership: \u201cWe must declare that there are no shades of gray,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re with us or against us.\u201d .\nB ush rolled to re-election, and the NRA continued to roll up victories. The Assault Weapons Ban expired in 2004, reopening the market for the high-capacity magazines favored by mass murderers. And in 2005, the NRA finally secured clean passage of a law immunizing manufacturers, importers, distributors and dealers from any civil liability. After President Bush signed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act that October, LaPierre called it \u201cthe most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.\u201d Who did it benefit? LaPierre made no pretenses: \u201cHistory will show that this law helped save the American firearms industry.\u201d .\nThe NRA, severely weakened just years earlier, seemed once again an invincible force in Washington. And Democrats, tired of losing elections on the issue, made gun control the new third rail of Washington politics. In the 2006 election cycle, two longtime foes of the NRA, Rahm Emanuel and Charles Schumer, were responsible for recruiting and funding attractive Dem ...evidence too long",0

While attorney general, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis.\"" .\nA new Nevada ad campaign claims Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto \""failed Nevada rape victims\"" during her tenure as the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney general.\nSenate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has launched several ads attacking the former attorney general on the issue of untested rape test kits.\n\""Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims,\"" the ad says.\\xc2\\xa0\""While Attorney General, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis.\"".\nCortez Masto\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign has taken the ads seriously, as she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staked much of her candidacy on her record of combating human trafficking and violence against women (even releasing two ads attempting to push back on the claims).\nHowever, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to find any evidence that she took on the specific problem of the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rape kit backlog while in office from 2006 to 2014.\n\""Rape kits\"" are shorthand for sexual assault forensic evidence kits, intended to be collected soon after a sexual assault or rape by a nurse or doctor. It collects a variety of evidence including the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical history, tissue and hair samples from the victim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body and clothes, photos of injuries sustained by the victim, and biological samples such as saliva, blood, semen, urine, skin cells and hair.\nNevada came under fire in October 2014 when a nonprofit group released a report showing Las Vegas tested only 16 percent of kits collected by police between 2004 and 2013, with more than 4,300 left unprocessed. Nationwide, the backlog of untested kits was estimated to be more than 400,000 in 2014.\nKits aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tested for several reasons, including if police decline to request a test in favor of other evidence or if the victim decides not to proceed with prosecution. Testing kits can also be expensive (up to $1,500 for an individual kit), which contributes to backlogs.\nAdvocates say that testing every kit is important because DNA samples from the kits are entered into an FBI database which can uncover new leads and introduce evidence linking sexual assault or rape cases together.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund ads use several pieces of evidence to claim that Cortez Masto \""neglected\"" the issue for eight years, including video of an October 2014 exchange between her and a member of a criminal justice committee on the backlog issue.\nThe video highlights a question from Richard Siegel, former president of the Nevada American Civil Liberties Union, asking Cortez Masto if she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aware of recent articles about the unprocessed rape kit backlog issue.\nCortez Masto responds that she hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t (clip begins at 2:17:40 ), which the ad highlights as evidence that she had \""no idea\"" of the issue.\nA review of the video shows the ad plays the exchange relatively straightforward, but Siegel (who is supporting Cortez Masto) says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taken out of context and ignores all the other work she did on the issue.\n\""The truth was the opposite of that,\"" he said. \""She was the leader without any question with anything to do about sexual violence.\"".\nStill, there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much evidence that Cortez Masto specifically tackled the backlog issue while in office, though she did support legislation expanding access to rape test kits and more broadly sought support for victims of human trafficking and sexual violence.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe most direct evidence provided by the Cortez Masto campaign is a 2012 letter that she and 52 other state attorneys general signed urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act . The letter references a \""rape kit that goes unprocessed for lack of funding\"" as an example of the consequences for not reauthorizing the bill.\nCortez Masto also worked on legislation expanding access to sexual assault kits, secured grants to combat violence against women, and helped draft legislation preventing rape or domestic violence victims from being compensated due to their \""conduct,\"" which critics say is a form of victim-blaming.\nHer successor, Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt, made filling the backlog a campaign pledge and was able to secure roughly $3.7 million in grants and redirected settlement funds to pay for funding the backlog about a year after taking office.\nThough the funding is secured, filling the backlog is still a work in progress. Out of about 8,000 total untested kits, the Attorney General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office says about 1,500 have been sent out for testing as of August 2016, with expectations that roughly half of backlogged kits will be sent out for testing by the end of next year.\nAdding to the complexity is that responsibility over untested rape kits is a jurisdictional web, as Nevada is an outlier among most states in not having a dedicated state-level forensic lab. The state is instead served by two separate police-run facilities in Reno and Las Vegas servicing the rest of the state.\n\""The attorney general has no responsibility over the laboratory or over the police agencies that the laboratory serves,\"" said Renee Romero, former director of the Reno-area forensic lab.\nSo there is no statutory requirement that Nevada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney general must oversee rape test kits and any potential backlogs, but as the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top law enforcement officer, they clearly have the discretion and freedom to take on issues that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t clearly laid out in state law.\nThe ads also claim that Cortez Masto was unable to find money needed to address the backlog, while her successor \""quickly\"" found funds to fill the backlog.\nLaxalt did gain approval from legislators in December 2015 allocating $3.7 million targeting the backlog, but those funds came from various sources, including a one time payment of $1.7 million in settlement funds from JP Morgan Chase case over fraudulent debt collection practices.\nThe initial action against the bank was taken by a group of 13 state attorneys general (not including Nevada) that negotiated the national settlement . Nevada received $1.7 million from that deal, which Laxalt asked to have specifically dedicated to filling the rape-kit backlog.\nCortez Masto\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office did send out an advisory in 2014 encouraging Nevadans to file complaints about fraudulent debt collection practices with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to draw a line between that press release and the ultimate settlement agreement, which Nevada played no part in negotiating and coming in July 2015 , after she left office.\n\""It is unclear what former Attorney General Masto is referencing when she states that her work \\'helped fund testing of Nevada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rape kit\\'\\xc2\\xa0backlog,\"" Attorney General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office spokeswoman Monica Moazez said in a statement.\nLaxalt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office also applied for and received around $1.9 million in federal grant money to address the backlog, which wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t available when Cortez Masto was in office . But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a new issue, as Congress has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars targeting rape-kit backlogs since 2004 (though it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been criticized for not effectively tackling the problem).\nOne reason Cortez Masto may not have tackled the backlog issue specifically is because the extent of problem wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t revealed until the final months of her term. The first reporting as to the actual extent of the backlog appeared in October 2014 , just two months before Cortez Masto left office.\nSenate Leadership Fund claims, \""Catherine Cortez Masto failed Nevada rape victims,\"" and \""while attorney general, thousands of rape kits were never sent for DNA analysis.\"".\nThe ad is misleading in the sense that it portrays Cortez Masto as insensitive to the plight of victims of rape, but the charge that nothing was done to reduce the backlog during her time as attorney general is accurate. However, the labs where rape kits are tested are run by police, and not directly by the attorney general.\nCatherine Cortez Masto campaign, \"" Professor Featured in Mitch McConnell\u2019s Attack Ad Against Cortez Masto Calls For Ad to Be Taken Down ,\"" Sept. 14, 2016.\nCatherine Cortez Masto campaign, \"" FACT CHECK: While Congressman Heck Voted Against Funding to Test Rape Kits, Cortez Masto Helped Secure Funding to Help Rape Victims ,\"" Sept. 13, 2016.\nNevada Office of the Attorney General, \"" ATTORNEY GENERAL LAXALT ISSUES STATEMENT FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF UNTESTED RAPE KIT FUNDS ,\"" Dec. 16, 2016.\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, \"" CFPB, 47 States and D.C.

He previously served as the 50th Attorney General of Ohio , from 2011 to 2019, and in both houses of Congress: in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 1991 and in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007. He is a member of the Republican Party . .\nDeWine was born in Yellow Springs, Ohio , in 1947. He graduated from Miami University with a bachelor\\'s degree in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Ohio Northern University College of Law in 1972. After graduation, DeWine worked as an assistant prosecutor for Greene County and was elected district attorney, serving one term. A lifelong member of the Republican Party , he began his political career in the Ohio Senate in 1980. He served as a U.S. representative from 1983 until 1991. In 1991 he was sworn in as the 59th lieutenant governor of Ohio , under George Voinovich . .\nDeWine was elected to the United States Senate in a landslide in the 1994 Republican Revolution . He served in the Senate until his defeat by Sherrod Brown in 2006. DeWine returned to politics four years later and became the 50th attorney general of Ohio , serving from 2011 to 2019. He was elected governor in 2018 . During DeWine\\'s first term as governor, a shooting in Dayton prompted him to urge the Ohio legislature to enact new gun control measures, such as expanding background checks and harsher penalties for those in possession of unregistered firearms. In early 2020, DeWine received national attention for his COVID-19 response. [3] He ordered the closing of dine-in restaurant service and sporting events and delegated additional resources to elderly care facilities. These decisions garnered him praise from Democrats and independents, but were criticized by some Republicans. DeWine responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by banning the sale of Russian Standard vodka and coordinating Ohio\\'s efforts alongside nonprofits for resettling Ukrainian refugees. .\nDeWine was reelected in the 2022 Ohio gubernatorial election , having defeated Democrat nominee Nan Whaley , the former mayor of Dayton , 62.4% to 37.4%. [4] Early life and education [ edit ] .\nDeWine was born and raised in Yellow Springs, Ohio . He is the son of Jean Ruth (Liddle) and Richard Lee DeWine. [5] [6] [7] Of Irish descent, he was raised and identifies as a Roman Catholic . [8] [9] [10] DeWine earned his Bachelor of Science degree in education from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio , in 1969 and a Juris Doctor from Ohio Northern University College of Law in 1972. Early political career [ edit ] .\nAt age 25, DeWine started working as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney for Greene County, Ohio , and in 1976 was elected County Prosecutor, serving for four years. [11] [12] In 1980 he was elected to the Ohio State Senate and served one two-year term. [12] U.S. House of Representatives [ edit ] .\nIn 1982, U.S. Representative Bud Brown of Ohio\\'s 7th congressional district retired after 18 years in Congress; his father, Clarence Brown, Sr. , had held the seat for 26 years before that. DeWine won the Republican nomination, assuring his election in November. He was reelected three more times from this district, which stretches from his home in Springfield to the Columbus suburbs. He ran unopposed in 1986 in what was regarded as a bad year for Republicans nationally. .\nIn 1986, Dewine was one of the House impeachment managers who prosecuted the case in the impeachment trial of Judge Harry E. Claiborne . Claiborne was found guilty by the United States Senate and removed from his federal judgeship. [13] Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate [ edit ] .\nDeWine did not seek reelection to the House of Representatives in 1990, instead running for lieutenant governor as George Voinovich \\'s running mate in that year\\'s Ohio gubernatorial election . The Voinovich-DeWine ticket was easily elected. .\nIn 1992 , DeWine unsuccessfully ran for United States Senate against the former astronaut and incumbent Senator John Glenn . His campaign used the phrase, \""What has John Glenn done?\"", echoing Jeff Bingaman \\'s slogan \""What on Earth has he done for you lately?\"" against former astronaut Harrison Schmitt in their 1982 Senate race. [14] [15] U.S. Senate [ edit ] .\nIn 1994 , DeWine ran again for Senate, defeating prominent attorney Joel Hyatt (the son-in-law of retiring Senator Howard Metzenbaum ) by a 14-point margin. DeWine was reelected in 2000 , defeating gunshow promoter Ronald Dickson (161,185 votes, or 12.44%) and former U.S. Rep. Frank Cremeans (104,219 votes, or 8.05%) in the primary and Ted Celeste (brother of former Ohio governor Dick Celeste ) in the general election. DeWine sat on the Senate Judiciary and Select Intelligence committees. He was the initial sponsor of the Drug-Free Century Act in 1999. [16] He voted in favor of the 2002 Iraq Resolution authorizing the use of force against Saddam Hussein. [17] .\nIn the 2006 United States Senate election in Ohio , DeWine ran for reelection but lost to U.S. Representative and former Ohio Secretary of State Sherrod Brown by double digits. [18] He received 905,644 fewer votes in 2006 than he received in 2000. [19] [20] [21] Post-Senate career [ edit ] .\nDeWine accepted positions teaching government courses at Cedarville University , Ohio Northern University and Miami University . In 2007, he joined the law firm Keating Muething & Klekamp as corporate investigations group co-chair. [22] He also advised the Ohio campaign of John McCain\\'s 2008 presidential bid . [23] Attorney General of Ohio [ edit ] .\nOn July 21, 2009, DeWine announced candidacy for attorney general of the State of Ohio. [24] On November 2, 2010, he was elected attorney general, defeating incumbent Richard Cordray , 48\\xe2\\x80\\x9346%. [25] As attorney general of Ohio, DeWine sent letters to drugstore chains encouraging them to discontinue the sale of tobacco products. [26] .\nIn the 2012 Republican presidential primary , DeWine endorsed Tim Pawlenty , then endorsed Mitt Romney after Pawlenty dropped out of the race. On February 17, 2012, DeWine announced he was retracting his endorsement of Romney and endorsed Rick Santorum . DeWine said, \""To be elected president, you have to do more than tear down your opponents. You have to give the American people a reason to vote for you, a reason to hope, a reason to believe that under your leadership, America will be better. Rick Santorum has done that. Sadly, Governor Romney has not.\"" [27] .\nOn November 4, 2014, DeWine was reelected as attorney general, defeating challenger David A. Pepper . [28] He carried 83 of Ohio\\'s 88 counties. [29] Legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act [ edit ] .\nIn 2015, DeWine filed a lawsuit in federal court in Ohio against a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). [30] [31] In the suit, he alleged that the ACA\\'s Transitional Reinsurance Program (which imposed a fee \""paid by all employers who provide group health insurance in the workplace\"", which in 2014 was $63 per covered person and in 2015 was $44 per covered person) was unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments. [32] When he filed the suit, DeWine claimed that the fee was \""an unprecedented attempt to destroy the balance of authority between the federal government and the states\"". [32] .\nIn January 2016, the federal court dismissed DeWine\\'s suit, with U.S. District Judge Algenon L. Marbley holding that the Transitional Reinsurance Program did not violate the Constitution. [32] DeWine appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed Marbley\\'s dismissal of the suit. [33] Criminal justice [ edit ] .\nDeWine\\'s stated goal has been \""Protecting Ohio Families\"". [34] To that effect, he made it a priority to significantly reduce DNA testing turnaround times in connection with open criminal investigations. Under his predecessor, DNA testing at the Ohio Attorney General\\'s Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) took approximately four months in cases such as murders, rapes, and assaults. Under the DeWine administration, DNA test results are now returned to local law enforcement in less than a month, leading to faster apprehension of dangerous suspects. [35] .\nUpon taking office in 2011, DeWine launched a special sexual assault kit (SAK) testing initiative after learning that hundreds of police departments across Ohio had thousands of untested rape kits on their evidence room shelves. DeWine invested resources to test the 13,931 previously untested rape kits over the course of his administration, which led to more than 5,000 DNA hits in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). [36] These DNA matches led to the indictments of approximately 700 alleged rapists, many of whom were serial attackers, connected to cases that would never have been solved if not for the DeWine initiative. [37] .\nDeWine also launched the Crimes Against Children Initiative, which paired BCI criminal investigators with seasoned prosecuting attorneys to investigate and prosecute child predators. The Crimes Against Children Initiative focuses on holding accountable those who sexually and physically abuse children, those who share and view child pornography , and those who target children online. [38] DeWine\\'s office also developed several task forces for the investigation and prosecutions of human trafficking throughout the state. [39] Opioids [ edit ] .\nAs attorney general, DeWine took steps to close down \"" pill mills \"" in Ohio that fueled the opioid epidemic . By the end of his first year in office, he had worked to close all 12 pill mills in Scioto County , considered by many to have been the national center of the prescription drug crisis. [40] [41] DeWine\\'s efforts also led to more than 100 doctors and pharmacists losing their licenses for improper prescription practices. [42] In 2013, DeWine formed a new Heroin Unit to provide Ohio communities with law enforcement, legal, and outreach assistance to combat the state\\'s heroin problem. The Heroin Unit draws from new and existing office resources, including BCI investigative and laboratory services, Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission assistance, prosecutorial support, and outreach and education services. [43] In October 2017, DeWine announced a 12-pronged plan to combat the opioid epidemic, drawing from his experience breaking up pill mills, prosecuting traffickers, supporting recovery, and advocating the importance of drug-use prevention education. [44] In addition, he went after the pharmaceutical industry , suing opioid manufacturers and distributors for their alleged roles in fraudulent marketing and unsafe distribution of opioids that fueled the epidemic in Ohio and across the country. [45] [46] Columbus Crew relocation lawsuit [ edit ] .\nIn October 2017, news reports surfaced that Anthony Precourt , the investor-operator of the soccer club Columbus Crew , was exploring the option of moving the team out of state. [47] After the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore in the late 1990s , the Ohio General Assembly passed a law requiring professional sports teams that had accepted taxpayer assistance to provide an opportunity for local owners to purchase the team before initiating a move. [48] In December 2017, DeWine sent a letter to Precourt reminding him of his obligations under Ohio law. [49] After Precourt failed to respond, DeWine filed suit against Precourt and Major League Soccer in March 2018 to enforce Ohio law and insist upon a reasonable opportunity for local investors to buy the team. [50] As the lawsuit played out, an investor group including Dee and Jimmy Haslam , owners of the Cleveland Browns , and the Columbus-based Edwards family announced in October 2018 they were working out the details of a deal to keep the Crew in Columbus. [51] Governor of Ohio [ edit ] 2018 election [ edit ] .\nOn May 26, 2016, DeWine announced his candidacy for governor of Ohio in 2018 . [52] He confirmed this on June 25, 2017, at the annual ice cream social held at his home in Cedarville, Ohio . On December 1, 2017, DeWine chose Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted as his running mate. On May 8, 2018, he won the Republican primary, defeating incumbent Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor with 59.8% of the vote. He defeated the Democratic nominee, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray in the general election, by a margin of about four percentage points. [53] Tenure [ edit ] 2019 [ edit ] .\nOn August 4, 2019, a mass shooting occurred in Dayton, Ohio , that killed ten people and injured 27 others; this followed a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas by just 13 hours. [55] At a vigil for the victims of the Dayton shooting the next day, DeWine was drowned out by a crowd chanting \""Do something!\""; the chant referred to the lack of legislative gun control actions on the state and federal level . [55] On August 6, DeWine proposed to allow judges to confiscate firearms from those deemed potentially dangerous and to provide them with mental health treatment while maintaining their due process rights. [56] [57] [58] Other notable aspects of DeWine\\'s plan include expanded background checks before purchasing a firearm, increased access to psychiatric and behavioral health services, and increased penalties for illegally possessing firearms. [56] [57] [58] .\nIn October 2019, DeWine held the first meeting of a Lead Advisory Committee he appointed for the state. [59] The committee is meant to advise him on the state\\'s lead remediation efforts. [60] In December 2019, he expressed his support for Ohio allowing cities to ban plastic bags, opposing two bills in the state legislature that would have forbidden it [61] being pushed by fellow Republicans. [62] .\nOn December 10, 2019, during the Ohio Contractors Association\\'s winter conference in Columbus , DeWine said that he wanted to improve the Interstate rest areas in Ohio by adding more information about Ohio\\'s history and culture. He also said, \""I\\'m told that our rest areas are sorry.\"" [63] In late December, DeWine announced that Ohio would continue to accept refugees. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , he wrote, \""Before entering the United States, there is a lengthy, complex, and careful vetting process done by multiple federal agencies to confirm a refugee\\'s eligibility for entrance.\"" [64] 2020 [ edit ] .\nIn January 2020, DeWine sent troops from the Ohio National Guard to Puerto Rico , which had recently experienced several earthquakes . [65] On January 15, he signed a $30 million funding bill for Ohio farmers to prevent algal blooms, which went into effect on February 1. [66] On January 27, DeWine signed Senate Bill 7, which gives military members and their spouses better employment opportunities by simplifying the process to transfer their occupational licenses to Ohio. [67] In February 2020, he announced new distracted driving legislation he was sponsoring. [68] Also in February 2020, he attracted attention for declining to share his opinion about Ohio\\'s death penalty, at the time having \""frozen all Ohio executions indefinitely as the state struggles to find lethal-injection drugs\"". [69] .\nInformed of the public risk by Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton , on March 3, DeWine canceled most of the Arnold Sports Festival due to the imminent threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio , before any cases or deaths were reported. The cancellation was widely regarded as \""radical\"" at the time [70] [71] but was soon seen as less so, with Axios calling DeWine \""among the leading governors in the country sounding the alarm about the threat of the coronavirus\"" [72] and calling his and Acton\\'s response \""a national guide to the crisis\"" and \""textbook recommendations\"", [73] pointing out numerous occasions when moves Ohio made were soon duplicated by other states. [74] said DeWine had \""been one of the most aggressive governors in responding to the pandemic\"". [75] He has supported funding for COVID-19 , signing his support of a funding bill along with 37 other governors in March 2020. [76] On March 11, 2020, DeWine issued an order limiting visitors to Ohio assisted living facilities and nursing homes, limiting visitors to one per day per resident, with all visitors to be screened for illness. [77] Also on March 11, he announced he was drafting legislation to limit mass gatherings in the state. [78] DeWine barred spectators from sporting events; was first in the U.S. to shut down schools throughout his state; and, on the night before it was to take place, postponed Ohio\\'s primary election. [79] He directed the Ohio Department of Health to order the closing of the state\\'s more than 22,000 food service locations and bars, except for carry-out. This was one of the earliest state closures of restaurants in response to the pandemic and drew disapproval from many high-level state Republicans. [80] On April 1, the called DeWine \""quick to defer to Dr Acton for specific questions on the virus and its spread\"" during daily news briefings, \""reminding Ohioans that the state\\'s decisions are driven by science\"". [70] 2022 [ edit ] .\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine , DeWine voiced support for Ukraine, saying that the invasion was \""unacceptable, and all freedom-loving people should stand against this unprovoked invasion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. [81] On February 26, he took action in support of Ukraine by banning the purchase and sale of Russian Standard (vodka) within the state of Ohio because the brand and distilleries are owned by a Russian corporation. Retailers were asked to \""immediately pull Green Mark Vodka\"" (an alternate variety of Russian Standard) \""and Russian Standard Vodka from their shelves\"". [82] On the same day, DeWine declared February 27, 2022, a \""Day of Prayer for the People of Ukraine\"". [83] On March 8, he directed the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to convene with resettlement agencies, faith-based organizations, and charities, in a summit to plan for possible resettlement of displaced Ukrainian citizens within Ohio. This summit occurred on March 17. [84] Political positions [ edit ] Abortion [ edit ] .\nIn April 2019, DeWine signed House Bill 493, known as the Ohio \""Heartbeat Bill\"" , into law, prohibiting abortion after a heartbeat is detected in a fetus, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest, imposing one of the nation\\'s most extensive abortion restrictions. [85] [86] DeWine opposes abortion . In the Senate, he was the lead sponsor of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act . [87] In December 2020, DeWine signed a bill that said \""fetal remains from surgical abortions in Ohio must be cremated or buried\""; failure to do so would be a misdemeanor of the first degree. [88] [89] Capital punishment [ edit ] .\nAlthough Catholic, DeWine has not joined the Pope and Catholic bishops in opposing the death penalty. [90] He has not joined former governor Robert Taft , former attorney general Petro, and former Speaker of the House Householder in calling for an end to Ohio executions. Taft cited the death penalty\\'s ineffectiveness as well as racial and geographic disparities in executions. Yet no executions have been conducted in Ohio since DeWine took office, and he has delayed executions due to \""ongoing problems involving the willingness of pharmaceutical suppliers to provide drugs to the Ohio Department\"". [91] As of 2023 [update] , there are no legally permitted execution methods in Ohio, since the state\\'s abolition of lethal injection. Gerrymandering [ edit ] .\nIn 2021, DeWine signed a redistricting map that favored Republicans. The map gave Republicans an advantage in 12 out of 15 districts, leaving two safely Democratic districts and one toss-up district. The map passed the Ohio legislature without any support from Democrats. Voting rights advocates called on DeWine to veto the pro-Republican redistricting map. In 2018, voters in Ohio voted in a referendum for anti-gerrymandering reform that encouraged bipartisan support for redistricting maps. The same year, DeWine pledged to honor the voters\\' wishes and support a redistricting process that was conducted in a bipartisan way. But in 2021 he approved the changes for 2022 onward. [92] Gun control [ edit ] .\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine leaves the stage after speaking, and the crowd shouts \""Do something!\"" in reaction to the 2019 Dayton shooting . [93] .\nIn 2004, DeWine cosponsored an amendment to renew the Federal Assault Weapons Ban . He has repeatedly received an \""F\"" rating from the National Rifle Association. [94] The National Rifle Association endorsed him for governor. [95] DeWine was one of only two Republican senators to vote against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act , which banned lawsuits against gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers for criminal misuse of their products. In the 2006 election cycle, DeWine was the first senatorial candidate to be endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; he displayed the endorsement on his campaign webpage. [96] [97] In 2019, DeWine proposed a Red Flag Law for Ohio that would allow courts to take a gun from people seen as a threats to others or themselves. [98] Highway safety [ edit ] .\nAs U.S. senator, DeWine joined a bipartisan effort to lower the national maximum blood-alcohol limit from 0.10% to 0.08% and to require reporting of vehicle-related deaths on private property like parking lots and driveways. [99] He sponsored legislation on determining when aging tires become unsafe. [100] LGBT rights [ edit ] .\nDeWine opposes same-sex marriage [101] and sponsored the Federal Marriage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would have prevented same-sex marriage. [102] He argued in the Supreme Court in favor of prohibitions on same-sex marriage, saying that same-sex marriage bans infringe on \""no fundamental right\"" and that states should not have to recognize same-sex couples who married in other states. DeWine was acting as attorney general against Jim Obergefell in the case Obergefell v. Hodges . The Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling against DeWine and other defendants, finding same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. [103] [104] .\nIn 2021, DeWine opposed a bill that would have banned transgender athletes from playing on sports teams that do not match their sex at birth, saying, \""This issue is best addressed outside of government, through individual sports leagues and athletic associations, including the Ohio High School Athletic Association, who can tailor policies to meet the needs of their member athletes and member institutions.\"" [105] [106] Marijuana [ edit ] .\nIn 2019 DeWine said: \""it would really be a mistake for Ohio, by legislation, to say that marijuana for adults is just OK.\"" In February 2020, NORML , a group advocating the legalization of marijuana , gave DeWine an \""F\"" rating in relation to his policies. [107] Net neutrality [ edit ] .\nAs Attorney General of Ohio, DeWine did not join the lawsuits that over 22 states filed in the months following FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai \\'s proposal to roll back online consumer protections and net neutrality regulations. [108] Other [ edit ] .\nIn 2020, DeWine signed a bill that forbids colleges and universities in Ohio blocking controversial speakers. [109] In 2020, DeWine\\'s compensation was 17th among state governors, at $159,189, compared to a maximum of $225,000 for the governor of New York and a minimum of $70,000 for the governor of Maine. The Ohio Checkbook shows that 92 employees of the Ohio state teachers retirement system, including director William Neville, equal or exceed the governor\\'s salary. Personal life [ edit ] .\nDeWine lives in the Whitelaw Reid House . [110] He and his wife Frances have been married since June 3, 1967, and have had eight children, one of whom died in an automobile accident in 1993. [111] [112] .\nOhio Supreme Court Justice Pat DeWine is Mike DeWine\\'s son. Former Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine is DeWine\\'s second cousin .

(Getty Images) .\nReince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and future chief of staff for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed criticism that legislators from his party and Trump were at odds on a series of issues.\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump disagreed with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans over mass deportations, trade, Social Security and Medicare, said Steve Rattner, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and an economic analyst on MSNBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Morning Joe .\n\""Well, there\\'s not that many, the conflicts aren\\'t as great as you\\'re outlining,\"" Priebus responded . \""President-elect Trump\\'s immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. That\\'s not extreme, that\\'s exactly what is in the House today.\"".\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised to build a wall to stop illegal immigration and to be tough on people who violated immigration laws. While he was inconsistent about his plans for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, he was firm on deporting criminals . Trump also said he would limit legal immigration because \""immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening.\"".\nTrump repeatedly criticized his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, for wanting to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States from Syria, a country afflicted by terrorism.\n\""When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats,\"" Trump said June 13, 2016.\nIn December 2015, Trump called for \"" a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\\'s representatives can figure out what is going on.\"" That comment came after a deadly attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\nIn his 10-point immigration plan , Trump said he would \""suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.\"".\nWe reached out to the Republican National Committee, chaired by Priebus, to find out which congressional policies specifically mirror Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immigration proposals. We did not get a response from the committee or from the House Republican Conference. So we did some digging on our own.\nA bill called the American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced in the House a year ago, calling for additional screening of \""covered aliens,\"" to ensure they are not a threat to national security.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nThe bill defines a \""covered alien\"" as a person applying for admission as a refugee and who is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria; has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria; or has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011.\nIndividuals cannot be admitted as refugees until the FBI director certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the National Intelligence director that background investigations sufficiently determined they are not a threat to national security, the bill said.\nA refugee may also only be admitted after the Secretary of Homeland Security -- in unanimous agreement with the directors of the FBI and National Intelligence -- certifies to 12 \""appropriate Congressional Committees\"" that the person is not a national security threat.\nThe American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by 102 Republicans and one Democrat. It passed the House Nov. 19, 2015, with a 289-137 vote and stalled in the Senate in January.\nAnother House bill, Give States a Chance Act of 2015 , was introduced November 2015 to allow governors to refuse the placement of Syrian refugees in their respective states if they certify they are \""not reasonably satisfied\"" that the refugee does not pose a security threat.\nUnder that bill, the governor could also refuse a refugee if he or she \""has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee\"" and if the governor determines that the proposed resettlement location \""is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants\"" in the area is too high.\nThirteen Republicans co-sponsored the bill introduced by Rep. Ted S. Yoho, R-Fla. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.\nThis summer, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) also introduced in the House the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act of 2016 , to \""suspend, and subsequently terminate, the admission of certain refugees.\"".\nThe bill is directed to nationals of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; or people who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in those specific countries.\nForty-nine Republicans co-sponsored the bill, which would also evaluate the costs of benefits provided to refugees and their impact on national security.\nBabin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill to suspend admission of refugees sounds like what Priebus was talking about, said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies.\nPriebus said, \""President-elect Trump\\'s immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting.\"".\nTrump\\'s policies include ending sanctuary cities, deporting at least 2 million people and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, not just restrictions on refugees.\nAs for the restrictions, a\\xc2\\xa0bill passed in the House\\xc2\\xa0that is designed to increase screening of potential refugees from Iraq and Syria. The bill also called for certifications that ensure potential refugees are not a threat to the security of the United States. But it has stalled in the Senate.\nTwo other\\xc2\\xa0House bills restricting the admission and resettlement of refugees\\xc2\\xa0have not been voted on either, so their outcome and support is still to be determined.\\xc2\\xa0.\n There has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno question of our credibility from our allies around the world\\xe2\\x80\\x9d regarding how the U.S. is withdrawing from Afghanistan. .\n Says Joe Biden has driven the current coronavirus surge because he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat meth \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost all coming across the southern border and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been accelerating for the last six months.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n Police defunding is to blame for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cskyrocketing murder rates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Portland, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. .\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGas prices highest in a decade.

And with states pushing forward a new wave of sweeping abortion restrictions and the Supreme Court gearing up to hear a direct challenge to , progressives have been pressing Biden to move fast. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBiden is the leader of the party. He needs to send the message that he supports abortion rights,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Destiny Lopez with the abortion rights group All* Above All, which has met with Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team during the transition and since he took office. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat starts with the administration being willing to talk about this issue or even say the word \\xe2\\x80\\x98abortion.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n In this May 13, 2021 file photo, President Joe Biden speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo .\nYet such action in Friday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s budget would be largely symbolic, as the policy change is almost certain not to clear the 50-50 Senate. And yet, Biden could still use the moment to showcase his transformation from one of the Democratic Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most vocally anti-abortion lawmakers to one of its most progressive presidents.\nBiden served notice he was following his party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s move to the left at a 2019 candidate forum hosted by Planned Parenthood, where he pledged that if elected , he would ensure \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoor women will have complete coverage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for abortion.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no rationale that can be offered that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re covered by the federal system, you cannot then use federal funding to seek reproductive health care,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told the South Carolina audience.\nA White House official told POLITICO that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing has changed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d since then, but wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say what Biden would do if Congress ultimately includes the funding restrictions in its spending bills.\nDemocrats who control Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99 discretionary spending aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t waiting for the White House to act, and have already begun quietly to draft a plan that would drop the Hyde amendment and allow Medicaid, Medicare, federal employee health insurance and the Indian Health Service to cover abortions.\nDemocratic lawmakers backed away from an election-year fight over the Hyde amendment last year, arguing there was no point in making House members take a politically risky vote with the repeal effort certain to die either in the then-GOP-controlled Senate or with a stroke of then-President Donald Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s veto pen.\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who took over the Appropriations gavel in January, says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow is the time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to push the change through, given Democrats\\xe2\\x80\\x99 narrow Senate majority and Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s support.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m where I have always been on Hyde: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m supportive of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sen. Bob Casey (D-Penn.) told POLITICO. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wide disagreement on the issue across the country, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made the decision now over generations that those who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t support abortion shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have their tax dollars going to it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nCasey, Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) voted to apply Hyde prohibitions to the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill Congress approved in March \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a move that would have extended the abortion coverage ban into the private insurance market but that fell short of the 60 votes required for adoption. Though all three still voted for the final package, Manchin told the National Review at the time: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe should have the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always supported.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who chairs the Senate Appropriations panel that oversees health spending, is currently talking to colleagues to build support not only for scrapping the abortion funding ban in the upcoming budget but also for passing a bill that would remove the issue altogether from annual budget wrangling.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEspecially with a conservative Supreme Court taking up a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do everything we can to stand up for reproductive health care,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said in a statement to POLITICO. Justices this month agreed to review Mississippi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a sign that the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 6-3 conservative majority may be ready to curtail the right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is one of those things where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to change people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re quite there yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nA majority of the public tends to oppose federal funding for abortions even as they support the right to terminate a pregnancy in most circumstances \\xe2\\x80\\x94 though polling can swing based on the wording of the question. The Democratic base, however, has shifted left in recent years, and Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2019 reversal of his long-held support for Hyde helped him with Democratic primary voters, a Morning Consult/POLITICO poll found.\nSuch trend lines are encouraging progressives to turn up the pressure on Biden back up his campaign talk, and warn that Democrats will face an electoral backlash if they retain the Hyde language.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA clean budget from you will send a signal to Congress that you agree abortion coverage bans and restrictions are harmful, unnecessary, and should be removed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nearly two-dozen progressive lawmakers wrote to Biden . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis will send a strong message to Congress, the country, and the world that everyone should be able to decide when and how to start a family\\xe2\\x80\\x94 regardless of how much money they make, the type of insurance they have or where they live.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n Demonstrators shout slogans and hold banners in an abortion rights rally outside of the Supreme Court as the justices hear oral arguments in the June Medical Services v. Russo case on March 4, 2020 in Washington, DC. | Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images .\nAbortion rights advocates have reframed the debate in recent years as an issue of racial and economic justice, arguing that the anti-abortion budget riders have created a two-tier system where people with means can jump through the hoops needed to get an abortion and pay for it either out of pocket or with private insurance.

Congress. State chiefs. School spending. Elections. Education Week reporters keep watch on education policy and politics in the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital and in the states. .\nNew legislation in Congress to prioritize parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rights to know what books their children are reading in school and the identity of guest presenters in classrooms underscores how such culturally divisive issues could stay in the political spotlight as conservative politicians champion what they see as a winning issue in 2022.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cParents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Bill of Rights Act\""\\xe2\\x80\\x94introduced Tuesday, according to his office\\xe2\\x80\\x94would prohibit nondisclosure agreements concerning curriculum; let parents make copies of classroom material; require schools to have parents opt their children into field trips, assemblies, and other extracurricular activities; and in general require more transparency from school boards and educators concerning things like student records and safety.\nHis legislation would also institute cuts in federal funding for districts that repeatedly flout such requirements, and would allow parents to sue and get injunctive relief.\nAs a practical matter, school board meetings and financial contracts between districts and external groups are already generally subject to laws governing open meetings and public records. Other provisions of Hawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill\\xe2\\x80\\x94like a requirement to have parents opt their students into activities outside classrooms, and parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 power to review curriculum materials and activities at a detailed level\\xe2\\x80\\x94could in theory create major headaches for schools. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unclear how federal funding cuts like the kind Hawley proposes would work in practice.\nHawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill is unlikely to get much traction in Congress. But as a political matter, his legislation highlights and underscores intensifying disagreements and ill-feeling about what schools are teaching, and to what extent the concept of parental rights represent a new national movement or an attempt to undermine public schools.\nSupporters say people are rightfully objecting to opaque and damaging policies from often-unaccountable teachers and school officials. Critics charge that such efforts, cheered on and aided by cynical politicians, are really meant to intimidate educators and also hurt students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 learning opportunities in the process.\nFights over critical race theory are some of the most prominent disagreements over what schools teach, although disputes about objectionable sexual content in books have also started making national headlines recently.\nFollowing the Nov. 2 victory of Republican Glenn Youngkin in the Virginia governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race that and controversial policies in local districts, Republicans have pledged to put education issues\\xe2\\x80\\x94specifically, what parents can rightfully demand from schools\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as the 2022 midterm elections. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said immediately after Youngkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s win that his party would introduce a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bill of rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Congress in the near future.\nAmong other broad provisions, it would affirm parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 First Amendment right to express opinions about education issues, require schools to provide parents a list of books available to students in their libraries, and establish the right for parents to meet with each teacher their child has at least twice a year. It also specifies that parents would have the right to review curriculum and instructional materials, and be notified of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cviolent activity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at their child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are proud that we have an opportunity to stand with families and demonstrate through our policies and actions that the Republican Party is the Party of Parents and Education,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lawmakers behind the legislation . Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the ranking member of the House education committee, along with McCarthy and other GOP lawmakers, introduced the House bill. Taking a \\xe2\\x80\\x98back seat to radical politics\\xe2\\x80\\x99 .\nHawley had a stark assessment of public schools and education officials in a statement about his new bill that reflects recent rhetoric, particularly from conservative leaders.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEducation has taken a back seat to radical politics in many schools and parents are taking notice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, citing critical race theory as well as a push from a national school boards group for the Biden administration to intervene and protect educators from threats and violence. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to give control back to parents, not woke bureaucrats, and empower them to start a new era of openness in education.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nIn early October, the Biden administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to use the FBI and other measures to protect school board members against threats and illegal activities, saying that it amounted to attack on parents merely speaking out about their schools.\nRecent polling has indicated that the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trust in Democrats and Republicans to handle education , which would represent a decline for Democrats who are already concerned about holding onto their congressional majorities in 2022, and Democratic governors seeking reelection next year.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law earlier this year, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible Hawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill is at least partially inspired by that and other laws. Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law states that parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fundamental rights to make decisions about their children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health care, education, and other matters can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be infringed by the state or public schools. But opponents of the law said that it could end up outing gay and transgender students in their schools against their will.\nDeSantis has put parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 power to make individual decisions about their children at the center of his ongoing battle to prevent Florida districts from adopting universal, no-exceptions mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSuch laws, along with Hawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill, could inspire new interest among state lawmakers interested in addressing and capitalizing on such issues. New burdens for schools, but for parents, too? .\nHawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office provided a summary of the Parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Bill of Rights, but did not make the full bill text available in response to a request Tuesday from Education Week.\nHawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill includes parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright to know what their minor child is being taught in school, including, but not limited to, curricula, books, and other instructional materials.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSchool and school districts shall be prohibited from requiring nondisclosure agreements or similar forms for parental review of curricula, and shall instead allow parents to make copies of curriculum documents,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the summary states.\nIt also says parents would have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe right to information on who is teaching their minor child, including guest lecturers and outside presenters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And it would require schools to promptly notify parents \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof all reported incidents pertaining to student safety, including all crimes or misdemeanors committed by teachers or other school employees.\nAlhough there are significant parts of Hawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bill that appear to be already covered by existing law, some sections could pose new complications for schools.\nFor example, its language conferring on parents the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright to visit the school and check in on their minor child during school hours\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (according to the summary) would create potential issues for schools\\xe2\\x80\\x99 security policies, as well as complications for any COVID-19 rules they might have in effect, said Julia Martin, the legislative director for Brustein and Manasevit, an education-focused law firm.\nMartin said that while supporters of Hawley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legislation might dismiss concerns about any administrative burden it would theoretically put on schools, the burdens would likely extend to parents as well. For instance, parents might end up signing a boatload of permission slips for students to attend things like pep rallies, and students might easily miss out on enriching activities and programs.\nAn Oct. 21 House resolution from Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., stated that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the First Amendment rights of parents at school board meetings shall not be infringed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the Biden Justice Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moves to protect school officials from illegal threats.

However, the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision in the 2005 case Kelo vs. New London, Conn., said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The court decided the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area.\nCruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ad references a period in the 1990s , prior to Kelo , when Trump wanted the state of New Jersey to use its eminent domain power to help him with a casino project. Trump planned to build a limousine garage to service the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City but several pieces of private property were in the way, including a home owned since the 1960s by a widow in her late 60s named Vera Coking.\nTrump has said he offered Coking millions for her property, but she wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give up her home. In 1994 , New Jersey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened to use eminent domain to seize the house.\nThe dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government in 1998.

The sheriff\\'s published policy declares otherwise.\nYou could read the governor to have said that Hernandez, who was sworn in as sheriff in January 2017, put in place rules against keeping convicts accused of violent crimes behind bars \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a broad unsupported charge given that the county continues to prosecute crimes of all kinds.\nBut in the context of Abbott\\'s\\xc2\\xa0mention of \""sanctuary city policies,\"" he surely was referring to Hernandez\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announced policy, effective Feb. 1, 2017,\\xc2\\xa0that the county would no longer automatically grant requests by federal authorities to \""detain\"" specified suspects for up to 48 hours so agents could investigate and possibly hasten deportation.\nHernandez,\\xc2\\xa0 in her January 2017 announcement of the policy, \\xc2\\xa0said the department would honor ICE detainer requests only if an inmate was charged with or convicted of capital murder, murder, aggravated sexual assault or human smuggling \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or if federal agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant for a suspect. Otherwise, inmates would be able to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status.\nHernandez said before the policy took effect : \""Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated.\"".\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at the wording of the policy , then gauge whether, as Abbott said, Hernandez was saying she wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t detain known criminals charged with violent acts.\nThe policy states the sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office \""shall comply with ICE detainer requests under the following circumstances: (a) when the detainer request is accompanied by a judicial warrant or court order for continued detention or notification, to the extent required by the judicial warrant or court order; or (b) when the individual who is the subject of the ICE detainer is charged with or has been convicted of the following felonies under Texas law: (1) Capital Murder, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.03; (2) Murder -- First Degree, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.02; (3) Aggravated Sexual Assault, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 22.021, and (4) Continuous Smuggling of Persons, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 20.06.\"".\nSeparately, we noticed, the policy leaves wiggle room for the sheriff to hold inmates facing other charges. A portion states the office \""reserves the right to exercise discretion in any individual case to ensure that justice is served.\"".\nWhen we asked the sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office about Abbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim, spokeswoman Kristen Dark said by email that no inmates placed in the Travis County Jail \""will be released without making bond or having his or her charges disposed by a judge.\"".\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nAbbott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s description of the sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s detainer policy, Dark wrote, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accurate because the policy provides for detainers to be granted automatically for several violent crimes and also gives the office discretion to \""ensure that justice is served.\"".\nDark wrote: \""In each and every case,\"" the office\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""command staff reviews an inmate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current charge/s as well as criminal history. If there is any indication of violence in that data, the ICE Detainer Request is honored,\"" she said.\nWe asked Dark if the agency had recently analyzed when jail personnel approved or rejected ICE detainer requests. In reply, Dark emailed us a spreadsheet , covering department decisions from March 1, 2017 through May 5, 2017, which she described as its May 5, 2017, response to an open-records request by KUT News.\nThe sheet doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show past convictions for any crimes, so we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a way to reach conclusions about individuals not being detained despite their criminal histories.\nOver the two-plus months, according to the sheet, ICE detainer requests were approved by the department for around 200 individuals charged with crimes, with many individuals listed as remaining in jail. Charges filed against the detainer-approved individuals include sexual abuse of a child; manslaughter; aggravated sexual assault; and driving while intoxicated, according to the sheet.\nThe sheet identifies 15 individuals already released to ICE in response to detainer requests. Related charges include DWI; assault causing bodily injury; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (two men); terroristic threat of a family member; manufacture of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver; possession of marijuana; burglary of a habitation; sexual indecency with a child; and aggravated sexual assault of a child. \\xc2\\xa0.\nMany of the people were arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated or possessing small amounts of marijuana, neither of which would necessarily signal a violent crime.\nWe counted nine individuals among the 90 who were each arrested for an alleged assault causing bodily injury to a family member--domestic violence, Dark told us by phone. Eight of these inmates were released on personal recognizance bonds, the sheet states, after the sheriff declined to approve a detainer requested by ICE; the ninth was released by a judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order, the sheet says.\nWe asked Dark about the rationale for declining detainers on those individuals. By email, Dark replied: \""The nature of the behavior that resulted in the arrests was not aggravated and therefore, did not meet the threshold required for\"" the office to automatically \""honor the ICE detainer request.\"" Dark said by phone that further research revealed that five of the individuals had previously been released to ICE, possibly even deported.\nDark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s email said: \""If ICE has past experience with the individuals, they should know the status and be able to quickly get a warrant or court order. If presented with a warrant,\"" the sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office \""would gladly have turned these inmates over to ICE upon the disposition of their charges by a judge,\"" Dark said.\nThe sheet shows too that a man who allegedly made a terroristic threat was released on a personal recognizance bond after the sheriff denied a detainer request. Dark said by email the individual had allegedly told a security guard at a bar, \""I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to shoot you.\"" Dark said no weapon was found in his possession.\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a distortion of Hernandez\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statements and her announced policy.

A leader by example and a worker by nature, she prefers the demand for day-to-day challenges over the political spotlight. Her passion is teamwork, and she strives tirelessly to leverage every relationship to the benefit of her community. .\nKeenly aware that challenges like mental health reform and public safety in one of our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fastest-growing counties cannot be achieved by one person alone, her focus is on partnerships. She knows that together, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re better. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proving it one collaborative effort at a time. .\nThe impact of her leadership has garnered attention and high praise. Sheriff Hernandez\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no-nonsense policy on immigration shed light on the issue of ICE Detainer Requests being civil in nature, lacking probable cause. It launched a national debate that continues today. Passionate about the plight of the mentally ill, she has made great strides in an effort to alleviate the unfortunate trend in county jails of inmates incarcerated as a result of crimes committed solely due to the fact they suffer from mental illness. Working together with advocates and organizations, Sheriff Hernandez is dedicated to seeing people suffering from mental illness treated in a hospital rather than a jail cell. Once an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat-risk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d teen herself, she is fiercely dedicated to efforts that keep kids out of jail and disrupt the school-to-prison-pipeline. .\nSheriff Hernandez was elected in November 2016 and serves a jurisdiction that encompasses 1,100 square miles, including the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital, with a population of 1.2 million. Uniquely qualified for such a challenging leadership role, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worked in law enforcement for 39 years, over 30 of which have been in Travis County. .\nShe began her career in law enforcement in 1981 in Llano, TX as a night dispatcher. In 1988, she moved to Austin and served as a deputy with the Travis County Constable Precinct 3 Office. In 1992, she was hired as a sergeant investigator for the Travis County District Attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office. In 2005, she advanced to Chief of Investigations and over the next eight years, built strong trial teams composed of investigators, prosecutors, and victim counselors who sought justice for victims and fervently worked to keep Travis County safe. In 2013, she was elected as Travis County Constable Precinct 3. .\nKnown as a person who tells it like it is, Sheriff Hernandez continues to serve on various boards and lends her advice and counsel to numerous organizations. \\t \\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t."", ""evidence"": ""Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez has the distinction of being one of only seven female sheriffs in the state of Texas."", ""nli_class"": ""contradiction"", ""nli_confidence"": ""0.990897""}]",0

Can this be true?.\n\""I wish I could grow a little bit more hair on my scar up there,\"" he told the Washington Post the other week, relaying the story of the kitchen sink.\nThe Wisconsin governor also brought up his bald patch in a conversation with a local paper's cartoonist last year, saying he went to the doctor at the behest of his wife and was told he wouldn't be growing hair in that area any more as a result of the accident.\nThe comments prompted some ridicule at the time, with left-leaning One Wisconsin Now accusing him of making \""hair-raising excuses\"" and \""bald-faced distortions\"".\nSpencer Kobren, founder of American Hair Loss Association and host of US radio The Bald Truth, says it's very rare for a permanent bald spot to be caused by a head trauma, but it can happen.\n\""When it happens, hair is shocked out of the system. Hair will normally grow back, but if the trauma is really severe it's like damaging the manufacturing plant - it can cause scarring of the underlying hair follicles and create lasting damage.\"".\nIt's more common for hair to be shed temporarily as a result of intense physical trauma, than to disappear permanently, Kobren says.\n\""In 99% of cases hair will grow back. I've worked in the field for 20 years and only come across three cases caused by trauma - and only one of those was permanent.\"".\n\""It's almost void of hair completely, so it is possible he did have accident at some point in his life. The only way to definitively determine if that was the case would be to do a biopsy.\n\""But looking at the density of his hair and his hair line I can see some recession - especially in the right temple area. That is a common sign of male-pattern baldness which is probably progressing naturally,\"" he says.\n\""The evidence suggests his hair is thinning at the front, which is probably down to his genes. There are classic signs of recession and hair miniaturisation,\"" he says.\nYates agrees that traumatic incidents can stress the body so much that it leads to sudden hair loss, but he says even being hit on the head by a shovel, or falling off a fence and landing on your head, would be unlikely to \""shock\"" hair out. You would also expect to see scar tissue, he says.\n\""It would be more like when Michael Jackson had third degree burns to his scalp. Also, why would the body just pick that circle? I'm betting Walker did have some level of trauma if he said he did, but either way, he'd have a hole there now anyway.\"".\nMost men will have some signs of hair loss by their late thirties, and around half of all men are affected by male-pattern baldness by the age of 50.\n\""The psychology behind hair loss is something that most people can never really fully comprehend. Some people don't want to admit it - they might not want to appear genetically weak or are worried about being the brunt of jokes.\n\""A balding man might think it will hurt his political career. The last US president that was bald was Gerald Ford, and that was because Nixon resigned. Before that it was Lyndon Johnson, and again he wasn't elected. The world, America and society looks at men with full heads of hair as healthier, stronger and more virile, and some people probably equate that to a better leadership in life,\"" he says.\nUS voters do seem to have a preference for the thick mane of a John F Kennedy or a Ronald Reagan.

Scott Walker recently mentioned his bald spot and attributed it to bumping his head on a kitchen cabinet. It quickly became fodder in the hotly contested governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race. Credit: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel .\nRelated Coverage The Wisconsin Voter: Milwaukee turnout one of the major keys to Walker-Burke election Walker says Madison voters driven by anger Jim Stingl: Walker\\'s bald spot becomes topic in hotly contested race Politifact: Burke on crime rate Politifact: Walker on budget shortfall Grothman, Harris spar over taxes, global warming .\nWe keep hearing the same things over and over in the race for governor. It\\'s either time for change or to stay the course. Job growth in Wisconsin is anemic or perhaps fabulous. Education blah-blah something or other. .\nThen Republican incumbent Scott Walker mentioned his hair and how his bald spot happened when he smacked his head on a kitchen cabinet. Wait, what? .\nHere I thought he had plain old male pattern baldness, not that there\\'s anything wrong with that. Please don\\'t vote based on a candidate\\'s hair, unless he or she is using it to hide money from bribes or kickbacks. .\nThe Wisconsin State Journal reported last week that Walker got to talking with cartoonist Phil Hands after a meeting with the newspaper\\'s editorial board. Walker told Hands that he accurately draws the hairless spot on the crown of his head. .\nWalker went on to say he was fixing something in the kitchen \u2014 he doesn\\'t say when \u2014 and hit his head on the cabinet. His wife, Tonette, repeatedly urged him to see a doctor, and when he finally did he was told his head would not be growing hair anymore in that area. He said Tonette cited this as proof that it\\'s best to listen to your wife. .\nThe governor weaves an interesting tale there, and it caused left-leaning One Wisconsin Now to go apoplectic in a news release about Walker\\'s \""hair-raising excuses\"" and \""baldfaced distortions.\"" In short, they think he\\'s lying about this and just about everything else. .\nBlog posts and other online references to the story outnumber Joe Biden\\'s hair plugs. Walker\\'s bald spot has its own Facebook page and, as of Thursday, 341 likes. You might say this isn\\'t really news, and you\\'d be right. But we\\'re getting into the political silly season of late October. .\nWe have all banged our heads on things without causing the seas to part in our hairlines. When we were kids, my brother had an accident involving a lawn mower and a grassy hill. It left him with a narrow inch-long bare strip on the back of his head, but nothing more Costanza than that. .\nThe top of my own head has developed a half-dollar-sized thinning circle as I get older. My barber \u2014 he coincidentally also cuts Scott Walker\\'s hair \u2014 is mercifully careful to avoid highlighting that spot when holding up the mirror to show the back of my head at the completion of each $17 masterpiece. I\\'d ask if she does the same for Walker, but there are probably haircut HIPAA privacy rules. .\nPoliticians need to worry more than most people about hair loss. Voters picking presidents have shown a preference for the thick mane of a John F. Kennedy or a Ronald Reagan, though we do have a Dwight Eisenhower sneak through every now and then. .\nI looked online for a hair loss expert to interview and knew I found the right one in William Yates because his website calls him \""The Hair Loss Expert.\"" He is a hair restoration surgeon in Vernon Hills, Ill. .\nThen I told him this article is about our governor and his story about the cabinet. Yates immediately went to Google and pulled up photos of Walker. .\n\""His hairline is thinning and he has a bald spot in the back. That\\'s totally normal male pattern balding,\"" Yates said, making it clear he has not physically examined the guv\\'s head. .\nCould it also be cabinet related? \""Anything is possible,\"" Yates said. \""But I had a professor say everything has to make sense.\"" .\nAnd it wouldn\\'t make sense to have a bald spot this big from banging one\\'s head on a cabinet, nor one that seems to be growing over time. .\n Jim Stingl Archive Jun 11, 2016 | Mentor relationship grows into 16-year friendship Jun 9, 2016 | Vape shop caught up in CBD legality debate Jun 7, 2016 | Acquaintance donates kidney, solves family dilemma May 28, 2016 | With peers downsizing, couple takes on ultimate fixer-upper May 26, 2016 | Walking & Eating Society pushes final plate away May 24, 2016 | Just shy of 113, Viola Jacobi was longest living Wisconsinite May 21, 2016 | Memories in a box: From the mundane to sentimental May 19, 2016 | Our flag is a mess, but do these finalists really say Milwaukee?

The high court has yet to weigh in on the merits of the case, but isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expected to do so before Nov. 4.\nRepublicans have pushed the law, which polling shows the majority of voters support, as a way to protect election integrity. The U.S. Justice Department opposes the law as a potential roadblock to voting, especially for low-income minority voters.\nVaudreuil said in the past 20 years he can count on one hand the number of allegations of election fraud brought to his office, none of which resulted in major prosecutions. Voter intimidation allegations also are rare, but he worries this year there could be more cases because of how easily voters could be confused about the photo ID requirement.\nVaudreuil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office issued a press release this week announcing that Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter M.

His explanation that a bump with a cabinet door caused it has plenty of skeptics. (Carolyn Kaster / AP).\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has a bald spot on the crown of his head that looks to be about 3 inches in diameter.\nNo big deal. Walker, who on Monday formally announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president, is 47, and politicians of all stripes have overcome follicle deficits to serve with distinction. Only a fool would bring it up during a campaign.\nThe Wisconsin State Journal reported that, after a visit with the newspaper\\'s editorial board, Walker was joking with the cartoonist and offered an explanation for the chrome on his dome:.\n\""The bald spot, he said, was the result of a repair incident in the kitchen when he banged his head on an open kitchen cabinet door while making repairs requested by his wife, Tonette,\"" wrote the paper. \""She kept telling him to go to the doctor to get the scar on his head looked at, he said. When he finally did, the doctor said his hair would never grow back in that spot, the governor explained.\"".\nOne Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, pounced, calling Walker\\'s tale \""inconceivable\"" in a news release and adding, \""It\\'s funny to think Gov. Walker would blame a cabinet for causing his male pattern baldness, but his pathological inability to tell the truth is making Wisconsin a joke.\"".\nMonologues of Dissent, a left-wing blog, said, \""When you blame a cabinet for your bald spot, people have to stop to wonder: If we can\\'t trust him to be honest about such a trivial matter, how can we trust him on anything?\"".\nA wag started the \""Scott Walker\\'s Shiny Bald Spot\"" Facebook page (more than 2,300 likes as of noon Friday), and columnist Jim Stingl of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published a skeptical essay noting that \""we have all banged our heads on things without causing the seas to part in our hairlines.\"".\nDr. Maria L. Colavincenzo, a dermatologist at Northwestern University\\'s Feinberg School of Medicine, told me last week that she \""could not explain a bald spot without doing an examination\"" and that scar-related hair loss is \""usually limited\"" to the injury site, \""but occasionally there is spread.\"".\nEither way, Walker survived the baldghazi controversy without producing a medical affidavit and won re-election by nearly 6 percentage points. But his strange explanation for a normal occurrence \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Why can\\'t he just own the fact that he\\'s losing his hair? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 will surely come up again as reporters dig for material during the long primary slog.\nOf course, should Walker become his party\\'s nominee and face current Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, whatever misrepresentations he may have made about the reasons for his lack of full cranial coverage will pale next to the litany of lies in Clinton\\'s past.\nI\\'ve been flashing back recently to the deep misgivings I had about Clinton\\'s presidential candidacy eight years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the difficulty of generating much enthusiasm for someone with such a flimsy relationship with the truth \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and dreading the prospect of trying to generate enthusiasm for her.\nIn general, I\\'ve not been particularly impressed by \""The Late Show Podcast,\"" a slapdash effort by Stephen Colbert to give fans of the late, lamented \""Colbert Report\"" a regular fix until he takes over hosting duties on CBS\\' \""The Late Show\"" on Sept. 8.\nMost episodes of the nation\\'s No. 10 ranked podcast have been rambling, inside-joke-riddled conversations with members of his \""Late Show\"" team.

Roach February 13, 2023 C.V. Starr & Co. Annual Lecture on China .\nWith economic inequality at an all-time high, some U.S. presidential candidates are proposing dramatic shifts to the U.S. tax code. How have similar plans worked elsewhere in the world? .\nAs the 2020 campaign for the presidency of the United States gets underway, candidates have announced a raft of new tax proposals, including increases in the top marginal income tax rate, the creation of a broad wealth tax, and reversing recent cuts to the U.S. estate tax. All three proposals are what economists term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprogressive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d taxes, meaning they would fall most heavily on wealthier taxpayers, in contrast with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregressive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d taxes, which more directly affect lower-income citizens. \\t.\nProponents say these measures would address economic inequality, pointing to the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 position as one of the most unequal countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a grouping of industrialized democracies. Opponents, however, say that such proposals would stifle growth and hobble economic innovation. They also argue that the experiences of other wealthy countries show a mixed record for similar policies. The Debate Over Inequality.\nIn the past decade, economists and policymakers have raised concerns over the economic and political implications of rising inequality, renewing debate over the role of government in redistributing wealth. Former President Barack Obama called it \\xe2\\x80\\x9c the defining issue of our time ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has claimed inequality diminishes young voters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 belief in markets and eventually leads to weaker growth [PDF]. In the United States, inequality has deepened in the past half century, especially since the 1990s. The OECD listed the United States as its fourth-most-unequal member in 2014, the latest year with data from all members, trailing only Costa Rica, Mexico, and Turkey. .\nMany in the United States have taken the view that addressing this inequality should not be a central aim of government, and that lower taxes spark economic growth, improve productivity, and make everyone better off. In 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed major tax legislation that reduced many federal tax rates, most notably the top rate levied on corporations, which went down from 35 percent to 21 percent and which members of both major parties had long argued hurt American competitiveness. It also lowered individual income taxes, especially for higher earners, bringing the top marginal income tax rate down from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. .\n At 26 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the overall U.S. tax haul is near the bottom of OECD countries. .\nThese cuts have been targeted by many Democratic presidential candidates ahead of the 2020 election who call for higher taxes on the wealthy. They cite not only rising inequality but also growing fiscal deficits and national debt that could threaten popular federal spending programs. This is a concern because the United States takes in much less tax revenue as a proportion of the overall economy than its peers: At 26 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the overall U.S. tax haul is near the bottom of OECD countries. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the 2017 tax reform will result in $1 trillion less revenue [PDF] over the following decade. \\t.\nBy entering your email and clicking subscribe, you\\'re agreeing to receive announcements from CFR about our products and services, as well as invitations to CFR events.

While many have higher rates than the United States, the taxes are often less progressive, falling more heavily on the middle or upper middle classes, rather than only the richest individuals. Raising Income Tax Rates .\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) kicked off the chorus for higher taxes in January 2019 , when she called for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on annual income above $10 million. Presidential candidates such as former housing secretary Julian Castro and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have embraced Ocasio-Cortez\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan.\nHer proposal draws on a 2011 paper [PDF] by MIT economist Peter Diamond and University of California economist Emmanuel Saez that suggested 73 percent would be the optimal top income tax rate\\xe2\\x80\\x94maximizing U.S. government revenue without deterring additional economic growth. They point out that top income tax rates in the United States were significantly higher for much of the U.S. postwar period, while the American economy boomed. As recently as 1963, the top income tax rate exceeded 90 percent. Political opponents and some economists claim such rates will deter new businesses and say that the high rates of previous eras wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t increase government revenue by as much as predicted because it is now easier for citizens to hide their earnings and report less income. .\nSeveral advanced economies have top income tax rates well above the current U.S. rate. Sweden, often cited as the most progressive tax regime in the OECD, maintains a top statutory income tax rate of 57.1 percent. The rate kicks in for citizens earning more than one and half times the average income, which comes out to about $70,000 in Sweden, a much lower threshold than current U.S. proposals. Other advanced economies have slightly lower top rates that still stand above the American average: Japan (55.9 percent), France (54.5 percent), and Canada (53.5 percent), for example. It should be noted that the top U.S. rate of 37 percent does not factor in state and local taxes, which vary across the country. .\nSome countries have experimented with even higher rates similar to what Ocasio-Cortez proposed. After his 2012 election, French President Francois Hollande implemented a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuper tax\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of 75 percent for salaries above $1.3 million. Hollande withdrew it in 2015 after drops in investment caused revenues to fall, which some commentators suggested was in part due to the tax making France a less attractive investment destination. Some employers reached informal arrangements to keep employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 salaries artificially low and then compensate them once the tax was removed, shrinking the income base for tax collections. Levying Wealth Taxes .\nAnother Democratic proposal is a tax on accumulated wealth, meaning the total value of assets held by U.S. households, rather than on yearly income. It is an approach championed by Senator Warren, who proposes taxing wealth in excess of $50 million at 2 percent per year. Wealth above $1 billion would face an additional 1 percent tax. This proposal, originally developed by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman [PDF] of the University of California, Berkeley, would apply to seventy-five thousand households and would raise some $2.8 trillion over a decade\\xe2\\x80\\x94more than making up for the tax cuts passed in 2017. .\nThe logic behind such a tax is that the richest Americans don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t derive most of their worth from income, but rather keep it invested in businesses, stocks, real estate, and other assets whose value can appreciate over time. Saez and Zucman join other economists, most notably the French economist Thomas Piketty, who view wealth taxes as the best way to reverse a dramatic worldwide increase in wealth concentration that has accelerated since the 1980s. Piketty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2013 book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century , argued that economic returns to assets outpaced the overall rate of economic growth, ensuring that inequality will continue to widen over time if wealth is left untaxed; others disagree . .\nThere are many arguments against a wealth tax. Some critics oppose the tax on constitutional grounds , and even advocates admit it would be challenged in court. Then there are logistical concerns: it would require significant resources to determine amounts owed to the government and ensure compliance. Some wealthy individuals may even renounce their citizenship to avoid the tax. Additionally, economic concerns persist. Some economists said a 2014 proposal by Piketty would reduce investment, employment, and overall output, and a 2010 study [PDF] of OECD countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wealth taxes from 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x931999 by researchers at Sweden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lund University found \\xe2\\x80\\x9crobust support for the contention that taxes on wealth dampen economic growth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xc2\\xa0 .\nFew OECD countries take this approach. While ten did at the turn of the century, today only Switzerland, Norway, and Spain maintain net wealth taxes. Some such as France and the United States tax property, which is a form of wealth tax that falls on the less wealthy. Wealth taxes in both Norway and Switzerland are lower than Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal for the United States but they apply to a broader swath of the population. Norway, for instance, applies a tax of 0.85 percent on all net wealth above $178,000\\xe2\\x80\\x94a low enough threshold that most small-business owners must pay it. Increasing Inheritance Taxes .\nThe U.S. inheritance tax, applied to large estates that get passed down to an heir, has existed since 1916, but the proportion of residents who pay it has shrunk over time. Between 2001 and 2017, the cutoff for individuals increased from estates valued at $650,000 to those over $11 million. The recent tax reform again raised the qualifying threshold: It now stands at $11.2 million for individuals or $22.4 million for married couples, with rates for amounts above the threshold ranging from 8 to 40 percent, depending on the total value of the estate. This applies to 0.2 percent of U.S. estates, and it is expected to generate $250 billion in revenue over the next decade. .\nThese taxes have long been unpopular, but Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a presidential hopeful, has proposed a substantial hike. He suggests applying a top rate of 77 percent\\xe2\\x80\\x94last reached in the 1970s\\xe2\\x80\\x94on estates worth more than $1 billion, and rates of at least 45 percent on estates valued above $3.5 million. Sanders says his plan would raise up to $315 billion over a decade. .\nThe U.S. trend toward lower inheritance taxes is in line with other OECD countries, where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe proportion of total government revenues raised by such taxes has fallen by three-fifths since the 1960s ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Economist points out. Sweden repealed its inheritance tax in 2004 after several high-profile Swedish entrepreneurs emigrated to avoid it. Australia, Canada, and Norway have all abolished their own in the past half century. Some outliers persist: Japan applies its estate tax more often than any other OECD member, raising $20 billion annually from taxing estates valued above $270,000. Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top marginal rate is 55 percent, above the current 40 percent in the United States and United Kingdom but below Senator Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposed 77 percent. Alternative Proposals .\nThere are several other approaches to reforming taxation that either have been proposed in the United States or are in use in other OECD countries. .\nHigher capital gains taxes . Taxpayers who sell assets for a profit must pay a capital gains tax on that profit. The current top federal rate for this tax is 20 percent, compared with the top income tax rate of 37 percent. Despite this gap, U.S. capital gains rates are actually in line with many other OECD countries, with a few exceptions. Denmark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top marginal capital gains tax rate is 42 percent, for example. Some experts say discrepancies between taxes on capital gains and income contribute to increasing inequality and they suggest raising capital gains taxes, perhaps up to income tax levels. .\nMuch lower taxes . Free market advocates argue that taxation meant to address inequality can, perversely, stunt growth and make everyone worse off . They say that higher taxes on the rich deter entrepreneurs from taking the risks that made them successful in the first place. Some maintain that tax cuts pay for themselves by spurring growth so much that overall tax revenue increases. .\nWhile most other wealthy democracies collect more tax revenue, proportionately, than the United States, there are a handful of exceptions. Chile\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax collection, for example, amounts to some 20 percent of its GDP , below the U.S. tax take of 26 percent. (The country joins Ireland, Mexico, South Korea, and Turkey as the only OECD countries with lower tax revenue rates than the United States.)\\xc2\\xa0 Chile\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low level of taxation stems from its 1973\\xe2\\x80\\x931990 military dictatorship, which, advised by economists trained at American universities (the so-called Chicago Boys), slashed taxes and privatized state-owned industries. .\nChile eventually emerged as just the second country in South America to reach the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high-income bracket. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese successes, based on years of consistent and often rapid economic growth, have made Chile into a model for Latin American success ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d writes CFR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Shannon K. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Neil. Yet inequality has begun to chafe at Chilean society, leading to nationwide protests against the widest gap between rich and poor among OECD members. .\nFlat taxes . Some politicians, such as Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY), have proposed making the federal income tax a flat tax, rather than a progressively graduated tax. Under these plans, all income\\xe2\\x80\\x94regardless of how high or low\\xe2\\x80\\x94would be taxed at a constant rate. Cruz proposed a 10 percent rate , while Paul proposed 14.5 percent. Critics point out that flat taxes are regressive, but advocates tout their ability to simplify the U.S. tax code. A handful of OECD countries, mostly former Communist states, have flat income tax rates: the Czech Republic (15 percent), Estonia (20 percent), Hungary (15 percent), and Latvia (23 percent). Estonia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s system in particular has won plaudits from conservative economists for attracting investment while maintaining an overall tax haul in line with other OECD countries. .\nConsumption taxes . The United States is an outlier as the only OECD member without a value-added tax (VAT), a consumption tax charged on the increase in value at each step of producing a product. Such taxes are among the most regressive form of taxation because those with less income spend a larger portion of that income on consumer goods. Economists tend to favor them because they see them as less distortionary and harder to evade than taxes on income or investment, though most U.S. politicians have so far avoided backing what would amount to a tax hike on the poor and middle class. Meanwhile, other OECD countries rely on VATs to raise the higher amounts of tax revenue they need to fund their generous welfare states: Denmark, Norway, and Sweden levy 25 percent VATs; Hungary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s is higher still at 27 percent; and even low-tax Chile maintains a 19 percent VAT. .\nTens of thousands of unaccompanied children have been arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border each year, sparking debate over how to respond.

Sinema is the Democratic frontrunner. The top Republican challengers are Rep. Martha McSally, former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward, and Joe Arpaio, the controversial Maricopa County sheriff pardoned by President Donald Trump . Is Sinema \""the only\"" Arizona Senate candidate refusing to make cuts to Medicare, Social Security or to raise the retirement age?.\nSinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team in response to PolitiFact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s query narrowed down the claim to Sinema and McSally, saying they were the only two \""who have had to vote on entitlements\"" and that the wording on Sinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a determination about \""what others may claim they will (or won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t) do.\"".\nWhile Sinema has a record of supporting Medicare and Social Security benefits, we found that her claim overplays the impact of some nonbinding measures voted on by her and McSally. Both lawmakers at times also voted the same way. McSally has generally been\\xc2\\xa0perceived as a moderate Republican (though she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s embraced a more conservative voice in the primary race), and Sinema bills herself as \""one of the most independent voices in Congress.\"".\nSinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign pointed to McSally\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Sinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voting record on motions and concurrent resolutions \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although those votes did not directly stop or allow changes to Social Security, Medicare, or the retirement age.\nFor instance, Sinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it. Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues.\nStill, budget resolutions even if they pass do not become law ;\\xc2\\xa0they lay out a plan. Budget resolutions also don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t affect Social Security \\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least not directly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because there are rules against it , Van de Water said.\nSinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team pointed to McSally and Sinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored \""premium support\"" program, or \""vouchers\"" as Democrats critically call it.\nUnder the premium support/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the premium support/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending. Arguments against the switch include concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time.\nVan de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to the Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fair to say that voting for a premium support/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said.\nMcSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team said, pointing to roll-calls and media reports .\nSinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign also said that in 2013, Sinema and other lawmakers wrote to former President Barack Obama urging him to reject any budget proposal that would raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, specifically mentioning \"" Chained CPI \"" (an inflation adjustment measure).\nAs PolitiFact Florida reported , a proposal to use chained CPI for inflation would not have lowered seniors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Social Security checks, but their checks would have grown at a slower rate.\nThe impact of the proposal would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that became law, PolitiFact Florida found in a similar gubernatorial race fact-check.\nSinema\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign also said McSally voted in favor of the tax cuts Trump signed into law late 2017 (Sinema voted against), saying they will lower Medicare and Social Security\\xe2\\x80\\x99s projected revenue. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve rated Half True claims linking the tax cuts to Medicare and Social Security\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future payments. The tax cuts are projected to increase the deficit, and some Republicans have called for entitlement reform to address it.

In nations without robust polling, the head of government can simply decree citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wants and needs instead. .\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, some observers understandably questioned whether polling in the United States is still up to the task of producing accurate information. Errors in 2016 laid bare some real limitations of polling, even as clear-eyed reviews of national polls in both 2016 and 2018 found that polls still perform well when done carefully. .\nOne way to help avoid a repeat of the skepticism about surveys that followed the last presidential election is to narrow the gap between perception and reality when it comes to how polling works. People have many notions about polling \\xe2\\x80\\x93 often based on an introductory statistics class, but sometimes even less \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that are frequently false. The real environment in which polls are conducted bears little resemblance to the idealized settings presented in textbooks. .\nWith that in mind, here are some key points the public should know about polling heading into this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential election. .\nDifferent polling organizations conduct their surveys in quite different ways. Survey methodology is undergoing a period of creative ferment. Currently, CNN and Fox News conduct polls by telephone using live interviewers, CBS News and Politico field their polls online using opt-in panels, and The Associated Press and Pew Research Center conduct polls online using a panel of respondents recruited offline. There is even a fourth group of pollsters that combine methods like robocalls and online surveying with opt-in samples. These different approaches have consequences for data quality , as well as accuracy in elections . .\nThe barriers to entry in the polling field have disappeared. Technology has disrupted polling in ways similar to its impact on journalism: by making it possible for anyone with a few thousand dollars to enter the field and conduct a national poll. As with journalism, there are pluses and minuses to this democratization. There has been a wave of experimentation with new approaches, but there has also been a proliferation of polls from firms with little to no survey credentials or track record. In 2016, this contributed to a state polling landscape overrun with fast and cheap polls, most of which made a preventable mistake: failing to correct for an overrepresentation of college-educated voters , who leaned heavily toward Hillary Clinton. Some newcomer polls might provide good data, but poll watchers should not take that on faith. .\nA poll may label itself \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnationally representative,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a guarantee that its methodology is solid. When applied to surveys, the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnationally representative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sounds like a promise of a poll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trustworthiness. But the term doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t convey any specific technical information or come with any guarantees. Surveys can be sampled and adjusted to represent the country on certain dimensions, so any person can make this claim about any poll, regardless of its quality. Unfortunately, this is part of a broader trend in which the lingo used to promote surveys (\\xe2\\x80\\x9corganic sampling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnext-gen sampling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cglobal marketplace,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for example) can on some occasions obscure flawed methodologies that lead to bias . Poll watchers would do well to focus on key questions for vetting polls, such as those included in this guide for reporters published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SciLine, or Pew Research Center\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own field guide to polling . .\nThe real margin of error is often about double the one reported. The notion that a typical margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points leads people to think that polls are more precise than they really are. Why is that? For starters, the margin of error addresses only one source of potential error: the fact that random samples are likely to differ a little from the population just by chance. But there are three other, equally important sources of error in polling: nonresponse , coverage error (where not all the target population has a chance of being sampled) and mismeasurement . Not only does the margin of error fail to account for those other sources of potential error, it implies to the public that they do not exist, which is not true. .\nSeveral recent studies show that the average error in a poll estimate may be closer to 6 percentage points, not the 3 points implied by a typical margin of error. While polls remain useful in showing whether the public tends to favor or oppose key policies, this hidden error underscores the fact that polls are not precise enough to call the winner in a close election. .\nHuge sample sizes sound impressive, but sometimes they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean much. Students learning about surveys are generally taught that a very large sample size is a sign of quality because it means that the results are more precise. While that principle remains true in theory, the reality of modern polling is different. As Nate Cohn of The New York Times has explained , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOften, the polls with huge samples are actually just using cheap and problematic sampling methods.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nStudents learning about surveys are generally taught that a very large sample size is a sign of quality because it means that the results are more precise. While that principle remains true in theory, the reality of modern polling is different. .\nAdding more and more interviews from a biased source does not improve estimates. For example, online opt-in polls are based on convenience samples that tend to overrepresent adults who self-identify as Democrats, live alone, do not have children and have lower incomes. While an online opt-in survey with 8,000 interviews may sound more impressive than one with 2,000 interviews, a 2018 study by the Center found virtually no difference in accuracy. .\nThere is evidence that when the public is told that a candidate is extremely likely to win, some people may be less likely to vote. Following the 2016 election, many wondered whether the pervasive forecasts all but guaranteeing a Clinton victory \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two modelers put her chances at 99% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 led some would-be voters to conclude that the race was effectively over and their vote would not make a difference. Now there is scientific research to back up that logic. A team of researchers found experimental evidence that when people have high confidence that one candidate will win, they are less likely to vote. This helps explain why some analysts of polls say elections should be covered using traditional polling estimates and margins of error rather than speculative win probabilities (also known as probabilistic forecasts). .\nEstimates of the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views of candidates and major policies are generally trustworthy, but estimates of who will win the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chorse race\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are less so. Taking 2016 as an example, both Donald Trump and Clinton had historically poor favorability ratings. That turned out to be a signal that many Americans were struggling to decide whom to support and whether to vote at all. By contrast, a raft of state polls in the Upper Midwest showing Clinton with a lead in the horse race proved to be a mirage. .\nLeaving aside the fact that the national popular vote for president doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t directly determine who wins the election, there are several reasons why the final vote margin is harder to accurately gauge, starting with the fact that it is notoriously difficult to figure out which survey respondents will actually turn out to vote and which will not. This year, there will be added uncertainty in horse race estimates stemming from possible pandemic-related barriers to voting. Far more people will vote by mail \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or try to do so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 than in the past, and if fewer polling places than usual are available, lines may be very long. All of this is to remind us that the real value in election polling is to help us understand why people are voting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or not voting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as they are. .\nAll good polling relies on statistical adjustment called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cweighting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to make sure that samples align with the broader population on key characteristics. Historically, public opinion researchers have relied on the ability to adjust their datasets using a core set of demographics to correct imbalances between the survey sample and the population. There is a growing realization among survey researchers that weighting a poll on just a few variables like age, race and sex is insufficient for getting accurate results. Some groups of people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as older adults and college graduates \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are more likely to take surveys, which can lead to errors that are too sizable for a simple three- or four-variable adjustment to work well. Pew Research Center studies in 2016 and 2018 found that adjusting on more variables produces more accurate results. .\nA number of pollsters take this lesson to heart. The high-caliber Gallup and New York Times/Siena College polls adjust on eight and 10 variables, respectively. Pew Research Center polls adjust on 12 variables . In a perfect world, it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be necessary to have that much intervention by the pollster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but the real world of survey research is not perfect. .\nFailing to adjust for survey respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 education level is a disqualifying shortfall in present-day battleground and national polls . For a long time in U.S. politics, education level was not consistently correlated with partisan choice , but that is changing , especially among white voters. As a result, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increasingly important for poll samples to accurately reflect the composition of the electorate when it comes to educational attainment. Since people with higher levels of formal education are more likely to participate in surveys and to self-identify as Democrats, the potential exists for polls to overrepresent Democrats. But this problem can easily be corrected through adjustment, or weighting, so the sample matches the population. The need for battleground state polls to adjust for education was among the most important takeaways from the polling misses in 2016. .\nTransparency in how a poll was conducted is associated with better accuracy. The polling industry has several platforms and initiatives aimed at promoting transparency in how polls are conducted, including the American Association for Public Opinion Research\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Transparency Initiative and the Roper Center archive . FiveThirtyEight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nate Silver found that polling firms participating in these organizations have less error on average than those that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Participation in these transparency efforts does not guarantee that a poll is rigorous, but it is undoubtedly a positive signal. Transparency in polling means disclosing essential information including the poll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sponsor, data collection firm, where and how participants were selected and the mode of interview, field dates, sample size, question wording and weighting procedures. .\nThe problems with state polls in 2016 do not mean that polling overall is broken. Yes, polls in the Upper Midwest systematically underestimated support for Trump, but experts figured out why : Undecided voters ultimately broke heavily for Trump; most state polls overrepresented college graduates; and turnout was higher than expected in many rural counties but lower in urban ones. Lost in the shuffle, meanwhile, was that national polls in 2016 were quite accurate by historical standards . Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advantage in the national popular vote ended up being 2 percentage points, compared with 3 points in the final polling average. .\nThe 2018 midterms brought further evidence that polling still works well when done carefully. The Democratic Party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advantage nationally in the U.S. House of Representatives ended up being 9 points in the final vote, versus an average of 7 points in the final polls. .\nEvidence for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshy Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d voters who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell pollsters their true intentions is much thinner than some people think. Do people sometimes lie to pollsters? Sure. But the notion that Trump supporters were unwilling to express their support to pollsters was overblown, given the scant evidence to support it. A committee of polling experts evaluated five different tests of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshy Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theory and turned up little to no evidence for each one. Later, a researcher from Yale and Pew Research Center conducted separate tests that also found little to no evidence in support of the claim. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshy Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theory might account for a small amount of the error in 2016 polls, but it was not among the main reasons. .\nA systematic miss in election polls is more likely than people think. A legendary quote from House Speaker Tip O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Neill said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9call politics is local.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But that has become less and less true in the U.S. over time. State-level outcomes are highly correlated with one another, so polling errors in one state are likely to repeat in other, similar states. .\nAs Nate Silver has explained , if Clinton was going to fall short of her standing in the polls in Pennsylvania, she was also likely to underperform in demographically similar states such as Wisconsin and Michigan. In 2016, most of the forecasters trying to predict the election outcome underestimated the extent to which polling errors were correlated from one state to another. Forecasters are more aware of this issue than they were four years ago, but they do not have a foolproof way to overcome it. .\nNational polls are better at giving Americans equal voice than predicting the Electoral College. The 2000 and 2016 presidential elections demonstrated a difficult truth: National polls can be accurate in identifying Americans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 preferred candidate and yet fail to identify the winner. This happens when the national popular vote winner (e.g., Al Gore, Hillary Clinton) differs from the Electoral College winner (e.g., George W. Bush, Donald Trump). .\nFor some, this raises the question: What is the use of national polls if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell us who is likely to win the presidency? In fact, national polls try to gauge the opinions of all Americans, regardless of whether they live in a battleground state like Pennsylvania, a reliably red state like Idaho, or a reliably blue state like Rhode Island. In short, national polls tell us what the entire citizenry is thinking. If pollsters only focused on the Electoral College, the vast majority of Americans (about 80%) who live in uncompetitive states would essentially be ignored, with their needs and views deemed too unimportant to warrant polling. .\nFortunately, this is not how most pollsters view the world . As the noted political scientist Sidney Verba explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSurveys produce just what democracy is supposed to produce \\xe2\\x80\\x93 equal representation of all citizens.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.\nshort read | Nov 2, 2020 Two-thirds of U.S. adults say they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen their own news sources report facts meant to favor one side \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.\n5 A Look Back at How Fear and False Beliefs Bolstered U.S. Public Support for War in Iraq \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t \\t \\t\\t.\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800 Washington , DC 20036 USA \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (+1) 202-419-4300 | Main \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (+1) 202-857-8562 | Fax \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (+1) 202-419-4372 | Media Inquiries \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.\nAbout Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

Those who feel that abortion is best left up for the states to decide will also find this bill problematic with its overreach. Sadly, the bill also uses the Fourteenth Amendment to justify abortion, as the Supreme Court did, even though in actuality it would make much more sense to protect the lives of unborn Americans. 14-S1696.\n(National Review, July 17, 2014): During hearings on S. 1696, Senators heard many myths from abortion proponents about the \""need\"" for the bill\\'s evisceration of all life-affirming legislation. Fact: Induced abortion is associated with significant risks and potential harms to women. Fact: Where abortion is restricted, maternal mortality rates have decreased. Fact: Women with abortion complications are told to go to an emergency department. This would constitute malpractice in any other scenario. Fact: Allowing women the opportunity to view their ultrasounds serves an important role in providing informed consent, enabling women to exercise true choice. 15_S217.\n The recent vote in the House to overturn rules protecting Title X health centers would deny women access to care. In 2015, Title X provided basic primary and preventive health care services such as pap tests, breast exams, and HIV testing to more than four million low-income women and men at over 4,000 health centers. In large part due to this work, the US unintended pregnancy rate is at a 30-year low, and rates of teenage pregnancy are the lowest in our nation\\'s history. The success of the program is dependent on funding. Family planning services, like those provided at Planned Parenthood and other family planning centers, should be available to all women, no matter where they live or how much money they make.\n(Heritage Foundation, \""Disentangling the Data\""): Planned Parenthood received approximately $60 million of taxpayer money under Title X, and $390 million through Medicaid. To ensure that taxpayers are not forced to subsidize America\\'s number one abortion provider, Congress should make Planned Parenthood affiliates ineligible to receive either Medicaid reimbursements or Title X grants if they continue to perform abortions. Taxpayer money from these programs should instead be redirected to the more than 9,000 federally qualified health center sites that provide comprehensive primary health care for those in need without entanglement in abortion.\n(ACLU, \""Urging Title X\""): Title X services help women & men to plan the number and timing of their pregnancies, thereby helping to prevent approximately one million unintended pregnancies, nearly half of which would end in abortion. However, current funding is inadequate. Had Title X funding kept up with inflation it would now be funded at nearly $700 million. We ask that Title X be funded at $375 million, which is $92 million above its current funding level. 17LTR-TITX."", ""evidence"": ""Warren was making a point about the relative safety of the procedure: On 24 July 2018, in Marie Claire magazine, Warren wrote: \""When abortions are illegal, women don\\'t stop getting them--they just risk their lives to do it.

Kamala Harris went after Joe Biden for his past on busing.\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential primary included nearly two dozen candidates, a once-a-century pandemic\u00a0and at least one memorable and tense exchange between the future president and vice president.\nDuring a June 2019 debate, then-Sen. Kamala Harris attacked then-former Vice President Joe Biden. The exchange led much of the media coverage of\u00a0the debate and prompted\u00a0questions later about whether Biden, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, would consider Harris as a running mate.\n\u201cAnyone remember Kamala telling Joe during the debate: \u2018You will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars,\u201d the April 24 Facebook\u00a0post says. The text sits over a cropped image of Biden and Harris facing off behind lecterns on the debate stage.\nHarris\u2019 jab at Biden was over his work with segregationist senators and opposition to school busing in the 1970s, not Biden\u2019s stance on China.\nHarris suspended her campaign for president on Dec. 3, 2019 , about two weeks before the sixth debate in the Democratic presidential primary.\nBefore dropping out of the race, Harris was on stage for all five primary debates. But transcripts of the debates from the service Rev and The Washington Post show she didn\u2019t say the quote attributed to her in the meme.\nThe only significant mention of China by Harris during those debates was in response to a question about trade policy during the September 2019 debate . ABC News host and debate moderator George Stephanopolous asked Harris how her trade policy would differ from former President Barack Obama\u2019s.\n\u201cWe have to hold China accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable. We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea.\u201d.\nHarris also didn\\'t bring up Biden\\'s son, the transcripts show. President Donald Trump and his supporters frequently invoked Hunter Biden during the 2020 campaign, accusing him of profiting off political connections, including in China.\nIn December, Hunter Biden confirmed that he was the subject of a Department of Justice investigation into his finances. The Associated Press reported part of the investigation was into Hunter Biden\\'s \""past work in China.\"".\nTranscripts of the debates did not show any other Democratic candidate attacking Biden with a similar quote either. During the two general election debates , Trump attacked Biden over China. Tense exchange.\nWhile Harris did not say the quote attributed to her about China, she did go after Biden during the first Democratic presidential primary debate in June 2019.\nThe photo used in the meme was from that exchange. In the original image , Biden grips the podium on the left side of the frame while Harris, on the far right, holds a pen as she points with her right hand.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., stands behind his own lectern between the two candidates. The meme cropped out Sanders to show Biden and Harris face-to-face.\nShe said she believed Biden was not a racist, but questioned the way Biden spoke of segregationist Sens. James Eastland, D-Miss., and Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., along with his opposition to busing early in his career.\nHarris was part of the second class at Berkeley Public Schools in California to be part of the busing integration program.\u00a0The practice of busing Black and Latino kids to predominantly white schools was used to integrate the education system following a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision.\nHarris later dismissed the exchange as part of \""a debate of differences of opinions and issues,\"" during a June 2020 interview with Stephen Colbert. Our rating: False.\nThe claim that Kamala Harris said, \u201cYou will do whatever the Chinese tell you! They gave your son over a billion dollars,\u201d to Joe Biden during a debate is FALSE, according to our research. Transcripts from the Democratic presidential primary debates contain no similar quotes from Harris. A search for other instances when Harris might have said the quote did not return any results.

Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I\\'m going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you\\'re ready, let\\'s start.\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted. Trump and Biden on COVID-19.\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It\\'s a worldwide pandemic. It\u2019s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we\\'re fighting it and we\\'re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it\\'s now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it\\'s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it\\'s now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that\\'s coming, it\\'s ready. It\\'s going to be announced within weeks, and it\\'s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me \u2014\u00a0a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn\\'t be here tonight. And now they say I\\'m immune. Whether it\\'s four months or a lifetime, nobody\\'s been able to say that, but I\\'m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that\\'s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I\\'ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we\\'ve been able to do with the \u2014\u00a0if you take a look at what we\\'ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We\\'re now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we\\'re rounding the turn, we\\'re rounding the corner, it\\'s going away.\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who\\'s responsible for not taking control \u2014\u00a0in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially \u2014\u00a0anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We\\'re in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what\\'s going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they\\'re starting from a very low rate. We\\'re starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we\\'ll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks \u2014\u00a0the President\\'s own advisors told them \u2014 we could save 100,000 lives. And we\\'re in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We\\'re in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal \u2014\u00a0one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world \u2014 said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I\\'d like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you\\'re referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?.\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we\\'re working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information \u2014 You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?.\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don\\'t know that they\\'re counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that\\'s the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He\\'s ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he\\'s ready to go.\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?.\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it\\'s totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don\\'t worry, we\\'re going to end this by the summer. We\\'re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there\\'s no prospect that there\\'s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n[6:55] Trump: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a dark winter at all. We\\'re opening up our country. We\\'ve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn\\'t know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January \u2014\u00a0months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he\\'s saying, \u2018Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.\u2019 But he didn\\'t move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said \u2018It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn\\'t know what we were doing.\u2019 Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way \u2014 every single move that he said we should make \u2014\u00a0that\\'s what we\\'ve done, we\\'ve done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is \u2014\u00a0he\\'s being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we\\'re, this is, \u2018Oh, don\\'t worry. This is all going\u00a0to be over soon.\u2019 Come on, there\\'s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it\u2019s going to be over soon.\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we\\'re learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can\\'t lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don\u2019t know, he\\'s obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can\u2019t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn\\'t do that. I\\'d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can\\'t do that. And here\u2019s \u2014 every, every meeting I had \u2014\u00a0every meeting I had \u2014 and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had \u2014\u00a0and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can\\'t close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can\\'t close up our nation, or you\\'re not going to have a nation.\nPres. Trump and former Vice Pres. Biden discuss reopening schools and teachers\\' health amid the COVID-19 pandemic at the final presidential debate.\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we\\'re, you know, we\\'re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We\\'re dying with it, because he\\'s never said \u2014\u00a0he said it\\'s dangerous. When\\'s the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It\\'s not my fault that it came here. It\\'s China\\'s fault. You know what, it\\'s not Joe\\'s fault that it came here either. It\\'s China\\'s fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn\\'t keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves.\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit \u2014 What happened? What did the President say? He said don\\'t worry, it\\'s going to go away, it\u2019s going to be gone by Easter. Don\\'t worry, the warm weather. Don\\'t worry, maybe inject bleach \u2014\u00a0he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We\\'re about to lose 200,000 more people.\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn\\'t have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You\u2019re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn\\'t\u00a0\u2014.\n[12:16] Biden : I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn\\'t about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let\\'s talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?.\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I\\'m going to shut down the virus, not the country. It\u2019s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part \u2014\u00a0why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they\\'re concerned. Those other concerns are real. That\\'s why he should have been \u2014 instead of in a sand trap at his golf course \u2014 he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I\\'m not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that\\'s above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools \u2014\u00a0schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he\\'s refused to support that money, or at least up to now.\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors \u2014\u00a0Cuomo in New York, you look at what\\'s going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all \u2014 they are shut down so tight, and they\\'re dying. They\\'re dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we\\'re not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it\\'s like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it\u2019s their immune system.\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You\\'ve demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?.\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We\\'re not going to have a country. You can\\'t do this, we can\\'t keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they\\'re committing suicide. There\\'s depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody\\'s ever seen before. There\\'s abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I\\'ve said it often \u2014 the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that\\'s what\\'s happening, and he wants to close down. He\\'ll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We\\'re gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you\\'re gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we\\'re going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there \u2014 not that many of you are going to die, so don\\'t worry about it. Don\\'t worry about it. Come on.\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what\\'s happened to New York, ut\\'s a ghost town. It\\'s a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas \u2014\u00a0these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it\\'s not the answer. I mean, you\\'re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can\\'t do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what\\'s happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It\\'s dying. Everyone\\'s leaving New York.\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don\\'t look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They\u2019re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They\u2019re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that\\'s where the spike is occurring significantly, but they\\'re all Americans. They\\'re all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money\\'s already been passed to do that. It\\'s been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing\\'s happened.\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what\\'s happening in Pennsylvania, where they\\'ve had it closed. Take a look at what\\'s happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband\\'s the only one allowed to do anything. It\\'s been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They\\'re having spikes and they\\'ve been closed, and they\\'re getting killed financially. We can\\'t let that happen, Joe, you can\\'t let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That\\'s why we have so many cases.\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\\'s best known infectious disease expert, \u201ca disaster.\u201d You described him and other medical experts as \u201cidiots.\u201d If you\\'re not listening to them, who are you listening to?.\n[18:58] Trump: I\\'m listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, \u2018don\\'t wear masks.\u2019 He did say, as you know, \u2018this is not going to be a problem.\u2019 I think he\\'s a Democrat, but that\\'s okay. He said, \u2018this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.\u2019 When Joe says that, I said \u2014 Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I\\'m not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We\\'ve learned a lot, but Anthony said, \u2018don\\'t wear masks.\u2019 Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here\u2019s his exact words: \u2018This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.\u2019 So he\\'s allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn\\'t tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than \u2014\u00a0much worse \u2014 than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn\\'t want to tell us, didn\\'t want to tell us because he didn\\'t want us to panic. He didn\\'t want us \u2014 Americans don\\'t panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, \u2018this is a really dangerous thing,\u2019 and a memo out of that meeting \u2014 not from his administration, but from some of the brokers \u2014 had said, \u2018sell short, because we gotta get moving. It\\'s a dangerous problem.\u2019.\n[20:33] Trump: I don\\'t know if somebody went to Wall Street. You\\'re the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don\\'t take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don\\'t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn\\'t be bringing up Wall Street. Because you\\'re the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn\\'t believe. We don\\'t need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don\u2019t tell me about wall street.\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we\\'re gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election \u2014 I won\\'t even get into the last one \u2014\u00a0this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I\\'m elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That\\'s what\\'s going on right now. They\\'re interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don\\'t think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don\\'t think he\\'s talking a lot. I don\\'t think he said a word. I don\\'t know why he hasn\\'t said a word to Putin about it. And I don\\'t know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he\u2019d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy \u2014\u00a0well, I won\\'t, I shouldn\\'t \u2014\u00a0I will \u2014\u00a0his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He\\'s being used as a Russian pawn. He\\'s being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And the ...evidence too long",0

Click here for more information on restoring citizenship rights in North Carolina. .\nOn March 28, 2022, a three-judge panel of the North Carolina Superior Court struck down a state law barring people convicted of felonies from registering to vote while they are under probation, parole or other supervision, holding that the law unconstitutionally discriminated against Black residents. The panel ruled 2-1 on the matter, with Judges Lisa Bell and Keith Gregory forming the majority. Bell and Gregory wrote, \""The legislature cannot purge through the mere passage of time an impermissibly racially discriminatory intent. The legislature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision in the 1970s to preserve [the law\\'s)] denial of the franchise to people living in the community was itself independently motivated by racism.\"" Judge John Dunlow dissented, arguing that the law under dispute served \""a valid and legitimate governmental interest.\"" [5] .\nVoting rights for convicted felons vary from state to state. In the majority of states, convicted felons cannot vote while they are incarcerated but may regain the right to vote upon release from prison or at some point thereafter. [6] [7] [8] .\nOn August 8, 2018, Judge Loretta Copeland Biggs , of the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina , invalidated a state statute permitting one voter to challenge the residency status of another, finding that the statute contravened the National Voter Registration Act . The case was initiated by the NAACP and others, who alleged that the practice disproportionately targeted black voters. Leah Kang, an attorney for the plaintiffs, praised Biggs\\' ruling: \""By purging dozens and sometimes of hundreds of voters at a time based on returned postcards, the state was disenfranchising eligible voters and violating federal law. This ruling ensures an end to this illegal practice.\"" Jay Delancy, North Carolina\\'s director for the Voter Integrity Project, whose volunteers initiated the residency challenges in question in an attempt to reduce the probability of voter fraud, said, \""We followed North Carolina law scrupulously in filing more than 6,000 individualized voter challenges in 2016 and the local election boards acted properly in sustaining those challenges.\"" [9] [10] Voter ID challenges (2013-2016) .\nOn July 25, 2013, the North Carolina legislature passed a voter identification law. The law \""limits the kind of identification that voters can use at the polls to a North Carolina driver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s license, a state-issued ID card, a military ID, or a U.S. passport.\"" Governor Pat McCrory (R) signed the bill into law on August 12, 2013. Parts of the law took effect in 2014, although primary photo identification requirements were not scheduled to take effect until 2016. Two lawsuits were filed after the governor signed the bill. These suits alleged that the law discriminated against minority groups. On September 30, 2013, the United States Department of Justice sued the state over the requirements, charging that the law\\'s new limits on voting discriminated against minorities and thus violated the Voting Rights Act . North Carolina was the first state to approve a voter identification law after the United States Supreme Court struck down portions of the federal Voting Rights Act in June 2013. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .\nOn July 29, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit struck down the state\\'s photo ID requirement, finding that the state legislature had enacted the requirement with racially discriminatory intent. On May 15, 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the state\\'s appeal, letting the Fourth Circuit\\'s decision stand.

Can you chip in to help keep Vox free for all? .\nIn a last-ditch attempt to revive the Keystone XL pipeline, 21 states led by attorneys general from Texas and Montana have sued President Joe Biden, alleging he overstepped his presidential authority in canceling the pipeline. .\nThe lawsuit , which also names several of Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cabinet officials , argues the power to revoke Keystone XL lies with the states. In their complaint , filed March 17, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen allege Biden \\xe2\\x80\\x9clacks the power to enact his \\xe2\\x80\\x98ambitious plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to reshape the economy in defiance of Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unwillingness to do so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nArguing \\xe2\\x80\\x9con behalf of the States through which Keystone runs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Paxton and Knudsen also released a joint statement on March 17, further criticizing Biden for what they say amounts to overstepping congressional authority. All states in the lawsuit are headed by Republicans and all went to Trump in the 2020 election with the exception of Georgia. .\nThe lawsuit is just the latest skirmish in a long legal fight over the proposed pipeline expansion, which would deliver more than 800,000 barrels of carbon-intensive tar sands oil per day from Alberta Canada to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would meet with existing pipeline infrastructure to travel further south to oil refineries in the Gulf Coast. .\nVox\\xe2\\x80\\x99s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday . .\nIn 2011, Congress forced then-President Barack Obama to make a decision on Keystone XL by including a provision in an unrelated tax bill that required him to decide the project\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fate within 60 days or determine it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the national interest. After several years of turmoil, Obama finally rejected Keystone XL in 2015. .\nBut when President Donald Trump took office, he invited parent company TC Energy to reapply for a new permit for Keystone XL. They did and were approved. .\nOn the first day of Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidency, he issued an executive order canceling the Keystone XL pipeline \\xe2\\x80\\x94 making good on his promise to the climate activists who helped get him elected, but inviting the lawsuit brought by 21 states on Wednesday who say they will be hurt economically by Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision. .\nDuring a January 22 call to celebrate Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential victory, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9c disappointment \\xe2\\x80\\x9d with Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision. And TC Energy (formerly TransCanada), which runs the $8 billion pipeline, announced plans to cut 1,000 jobs \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimmediately.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nSo when Biden met with Trudeau for a virtual sit-down on February 23, there were hopes on the Canadian side that the meeting could save the long-disputed Keystone XL pipeline. .\nBiden and Trudeau discussed several shared concerns \\xe2\\x80\\x94 among them Covid-19 relief, a joint response to China, and addressing climate change \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but in their public remarks, they were notably silent about Keystone XL. .\nRight before the meeting, the Washington Post reported that on February 22, a Biden official had said it was the end of the road for Keystone XL. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe decision will not be reconsidered. It has already been made,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. .\nJust after the meeting, Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s White House released its US-Canada Partnership Roadmap , which says the two countries will \\xe2\\x80\\x9claunch a High Level Climate Ministerial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d who will help align US-Canada policies on climate change and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincrease ambition to tackle the climate crisis.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The climate ministerial will also help both countries work toward stronger targets under the Paris climate agreement, accelerating the transition to net zero emissions by 2050. .\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just no room for countries like Canada and the US to be investing in the expansion of additional fossil fuel reserves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Anthony Swift , director of the Canada Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said. .\nActivists and experts say if Biden and Trudeau are really serious about bilateral collaboration on climate change, the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline should be a starting point. Moving forward with policies necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid the worst impacts of climate change will require Canada and the US to push each other to make an ambitious transition to a clean energy economy. .\nThat transition will only be underway once existing Keystone XL infrastructure is removed and other cross-border fossil fuel expansion projects (like Line 3 ) are canceled. In addition, ensuring the rights of Native people are respected is critical if both countries want to be seen as leaders on climate justice. .\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how the Keystone XL pipeline project ultimately failed, and why Biden and Trudeau\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9caccelerated climate ambition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d should include respect for Indigenous land rights and the end of fossil fuel pipeline expansion projects. The Keystone XL pipeline, briefly explained .\nThe Keystone XL pipeline became an almost perfect example of the various stakeholders \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Native communities, climate activists, scientists, policymakers, farmers, landowners, and everyday citizens \\xe2\\x80\\x94 engaging in the broader debate about climate change. .\nCanada-based TC Energy first proposed the 1,200 mile Keystone XL pipeline in 2008 as a way to quickly pump 830,000 barrels of tar sands (a.k.a. oil sands) per day from Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Alberta province across the border to Steele City, Nebraska. Once there, the Keystone XL extension would converge with existing pipeline infrastructure, traveling south to Texas for processing in Gulf Coast oil refineries. .\nWhen the idea for Keystone XL was conceived back in the 2000s, the project made a lot of sense \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the US economy depended on oil, and supporters of the pipeline claimed it was in both countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interest to find a way to transport oil efficiently across the continent. With oil prices high and demand steady, Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil sands easily racked up $200 billion in investment.\nBut there are considerable differences between oil from Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tar sands and conventional oil, which quickly began to wear on the region.\nFor starters, extracting oil from Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil sands, which contain bitumen (tar), a dense type of petroleum, takes a lot of energy. Most of Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tar sands oil is trapped beneath boreal forest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 only 20 percent of the oil is located near the earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface, where it can be easily mined, which means the forest must be cleared for the most intensive mining.\nThe majority of the oil is mined by injecting hot water into wells 75 meters below ground to liquefy the oil for pumping, which is why tar sands oil has a reputation for being among the dirtiest types of oil.\nMany Indigenous rights groups and people from communities along the proposed route argued the pipeline extension would have disastrous impacts for Native communities in Alberta: A lot of the water used to help extract oil from Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil sands comes from the Athabasca River. Studies have linked leaks from oil sands pipelines like Keystone XL to significant degradation of nearby land and water resources .\nA major concern is tailings ponds , the product of toxic waste from mining in the tar sands that can sicken communities and wildlife that depend on the land to survive.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe land is our solution, the water is our solution, the air is our solution to meet our needs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jesse Cardinal of the Kikino Metis Settlement, director of Keepers of the Water, a collective of First Nations who have come together to protect the nearby Mackenzie River Basin, told me. Cardinal helped lead the Tar Sands Healing Walk , a grassroots movement to bring people face to face with the destruction of the oil sands as a way of healing.\nEnvironmental groups took note of Indigenous opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. After then-President Barack Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s climate legislation suffered a stinging defeat , the climate movement coalesced around getting the Keystone XL pipeline canceled in 2011.\nInspired by Indigenous-led opposition to the pipeline, several environmental groups organized two weeks of sit-ins in front of the White House in the fall of 2011, leading to the arrest of more than 1,200 people . The arrests brought increased media attention at a time when there was relatively little national coverage of climate-change-related issues.\nJames Hansen, who has been called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c father of global warming \\xe2\\x80\\x9d for his role in testifying before Congress about the science of human-induced climate change way back in 1988, attended the protests at the White House. At the time, Hansen said unchecked exploitation of Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil sands would be \\xe2\\x80\\x9c game over \\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the climate.\nFacing immense pressure from the anti-Keystone movement, Obama finally canceled the pipeline in 2015 . He defended his decision in a press conference , saying the pipeline wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make gas any cheaper or improve American energy security. He added that approving the pipeline would ultimately undercut US global leadership on climate change, which he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d previously said was a red line for approving Keystone XL.\nIn January 2016, TC Energy filed a lawsuit against the US for canceling Keystone XL, using the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to request $15 billion in damages for what the company said was the arbitrary suspension of the project. The company then waited to try its luck with the next administration \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which turned out to be Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Keystone XL starts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and stops \\xe2\\x80\\x94 under Trump.\nIn January 2017, just days into his presidency, President Donald Trump issued an executive order inviting TC Energy to reapply for a presidential permit for Keystone XL to cross the Canadian border. He also promised a speedy process, just over a year after Obama had said the pipeline extension wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in the national interest.\nBut Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasons for canceling Keystone XL \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national interest, and it conflicted with US leadership on climate change \\xe2\\x80\\x94 were still valid, and activists (and much of the public) were still paying attention.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision, pipeline companies and the oil industry assumed every pipeline would get approved regardless of how poorly conceived the project was,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the NRDC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Swift told me.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPublic scrutiny around Keystone XL and the permitting process has shifted the expectation that pipelines would be rubber-stamped on its head. Now the public does want to see a robust analysis and a confirmation process that does make it difficult to move such pipelines forward,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Swift said.\nBecause oil spills from tar sands pipelines are commonplace , scientists and activists argued that a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crobust analysis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to examine the risks to water resources and the communities that depend on them should be conducted before the Keystone XL project goes forward.\nIn 2016, the National Academy of Sciences released a study that said diluted bitumen (which composes the majority of tar sands oil) differed from the other types of oil traveling through US pipelines in a way that makes it more susceptible to hazardous leaks. In 2017, 210,000 gallons of oil leaked from the existing Keystone pipeline in South Dakota.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny fact-based environmental review reveals reasons policymakers should not grant permits to fossil fuel expansion projects like Keystone XL in a world that is trying to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Swift.\nIn January 2020 , Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s White House made a last-ditch attempt at fast-tracking Keystone XL and similar projects across the country by limiting implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires the federal government to conduct assessments of the environmental, economic, and social impact of its actions before getting started on any project.\nBut in July 2020, the Supreme Court killed any hope of completing Keystone XL under the Trump administration, siding with environmental groups from Montana who argued that the Army Corps of Engineers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 permitting process for the Keystone XL pipeline should undergo a full environmental review because it would cross bodies of water. Biden killed the pipeline for good \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but demand for it had already weakened.\nDemand for oil, which had already been declining for some time, was hit hard in 2020 by falling investment, severe storms that hurt production, and the coronavirus pandemic. And in recent years, Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil sands industry, once booming with money, has had trouble attracting investment.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith falling oil prices, both because of the pandemic and generally down since 2014, the industry is under a real squeeze, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen a lot of players exit the market,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sven Biggs , Canadian oil and gas programs director at Stand.earth , an environmental grassroots organization, told me.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cConocoPhillips, Shell, Statoil from Norway, [and] the Koch Brothers have sold their stakes in the tar sands and moved on, which means there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less need for these pipelines than previously expected,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Biggs added.\nTC Energy had a difficult time attracting private investors to Keystone XL \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was only capable of putting shovels to the ground in the project with the help of a subsidy from Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who approved more than $1 billion in public funds in the spring of 2020 to help the project.\nSo when Biden pulled the plug for good on Keystone XL, climate concerns and falling investment in Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil sand led experts to believe that Keystone XL was dead.\nBut for many Indigenous groups, climate activists, and people from communities impacted by fossil fuel infrastructure, this is bigger than Keystone XL.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Keystone XL pipeline was never about any single pipeline. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about establishing a litmus test rooted in climate science and climate justice for government projects and infrastructure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kendall Mackey, manager of 350.org\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Keep It in the Ground campaign, told me.\nMoving forward, Biden and Trudeau have a chance to do just that. How Biden and Trudeau can work together to improve efforts against climate change.\nIf the legal battles fizzle out and Biden and Trudeau are serious about working together to raise US-Canada climate ambitions, activists say they can start by ensuring that existing pipeline infrastructure from Keystone XL is removed, providing greener investment options and returning land to Native communities, and ending fossil fuel expansion projects.\nThe first step in canceling Keystone XL for good is removing the existing Keystone pipeline infrastructure \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which Biden and Trudeau could work together to make happen.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow [that Biden has canceled the pipeline], the work of those of us fighting Keystone is to get the equipment, permits, and easements removed, and have TC Energy pack up their stuff and leave the communities for whom the threat hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t left because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still equipment there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mackey of 350.org said.\nBeyond environmental concerns, pipelines, which often see transient camps for workers adjacent to Native communities, have been linked to the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\nBiden and Trudeau (or the chosen ministerial) could also make sure that TC Energy, not taxpayers, foot the bill for removing the pipeline infrastructure.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn a perfect world, companies would pay the cleanup costs, but far too often it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s communities and taxpayers who get stuck with the cleanup bill, straight from abandoned wells down to cleanup in refinery communities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stand.earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Biggs said.\nIndigenous groups need better investment options than projects like Keystone XL, as well as a government that uses climate policy to make decisions.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the Canadian government reducing funding to Indigenous communities overall, they need money to run their communities and the option is investing in projects like the Keystone XL pipeline,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Keepers of the Water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cardinal said.\nSeveral Native groups have invested in pipeline projects like Keystone XL , but according to Cardinal, the Canadian government could change that.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe know there are better options. But it takes political leadership to support them. We have elected political leadership that is failing us right now. And Indigenous communities are being taken advantage of,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cardinal said.\nMany Indigenous groups on both sides of the US-Canadian border are also asking for the land back so they can return to traditional practices such as fishing, hunting and trapping, and making medicine.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of the solution as well, [giving] land back to Indigenous people so they can steward the land the way it should be,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cardinal added.\nBut all this won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be enough if the US and Canada continue to allow fossil fuel expansion projects. There are several tar sands pipelines in the area, including the controversial Line 3 , which would bring a million barrels per day from Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tar sands to Superior, Wisconsin. Activists want Line 3 to be subject to the same rules as Keystone XL, to bring Canada in line with its climate targets and to allow the US to retain leadership on climate change.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no question that Canada would and could be more ambitious with its climate goals if it could disjoint itself from its tar sands industry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the NRDC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Swift told me. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe still have Line 3, an area where Biden has a chance to make sure it is subject to the same environmental metrics as Keystone was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nActivists also argue that given the decline in investment in Alberta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tar sands, the financial reasons for such pipeline projects will continue to weaken as time goes on. The coronavirus pandemic has only sped that up.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in that tough fight on Line 3, but I think the likely outcome [if they go ahead] is that there won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be enough market and production in tar sands to fill those pipelines. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna become a stranded asset. If they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re built, then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only a matter of time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Biggs said.\nThe future of Alberta is also at risk as long as its leaders tie it to a dying industry. The alternative is for the US and Canada to push each other to ensure a transition is possible.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe employment opportunities associated with rebuilding our energy infrastructure and manufacturing [to meet] the demands of the clean energy economy hold much more promise than continuing our reliance on fossil fuels,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Swift said.\n Vox\\'s journalism is free because we believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.

The pipeline has come to signify the debate over whether fossil fuels should be left in the ground in order to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst damage from climate change.\nConstruction on Keystone XL began last year , and the company says about 300 miles of the pipeline has been built so far.

The company building it announced in March 2020 that it was launching construction, saying it would invest $8 billion in the project, with service expected to begin in 2023. But the project was stalled again by litigation over environmental concerns.\nBiden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order revoked the pipeline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s construction permit. He said the pipeline would \""not be consistent with my administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic and climate imperatives.\""\\xc2\\xa0.\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the spot market was $53.16 per barrel on Jan. 20, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Killing KXL does nothing to reduce demand for hydrocarbons. It will only make everything more expensive for consumers,\"" said Michelle Michot Foss, a fellow in energy, minerals and materials at Rice University in Houston.\\xc2\\xa0.\nBrook Simmons, president of the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, said that \""without pipeline transportation, product must be moved by less efficient, more costly\"" rail or truck.\\xc2\\xa0.\nToby Mack, president of the Energy Equipment and Infrastructure Alliance, which represents businesses that support natural gas and oil operations, cited a 2014 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service on railroad transportation of crude oil that said \""railroad transport reportedly costs in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 per barrel compared with $5 per barrel for pipeline.\"" That report also said the Keystone XL \""could move a significant proportion\"" of crude oil shipments \""off the rails, as pipeline transportation is likely to cost less per barrel.\"".\nOther experts don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see those higher transport costs automatically being passed on to U.S. consumers, for a variety of reasons. They point to larger market forces that affect prices, including the relatively high worldwide supply of oil. Plus, they note, most oil passing through the Keystone would have been exported, so Americans wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the ones paying for it.\nLess pipeline capacity likely means Canadian oil producers have to use rail more to transport oil to refiners. But they would be under competitive pressure to absorb the added costs of that rather than passing them on, said Richard Masson, chairman of the World Petroleum Council Canada and an executive fellow at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy.\n\""This is because U.S. refiners, particularly on the Gulf Coast where KXL was aimed, have the ability to import crude from tankers, and therefore pay the global price for it,\"" he said. \""If Canadian crude was to get more expensive than global crudes on tankers, the U.S. refiners would shift to a higher level of tanker imports.\"".\nHakes said most analysts believe that delivery by rail is somewhat more expensive than delivery by pipeline, \""but the difference is slight and transportation of crude oil to refineries is a very small part of the overall cost of gasoline  ...evidence too long",0

When a black New Yorker was turned down for service and racial bias was suspected, Morse, who is white, would be dispatched to see if she received different treatment.\nIn this case, a black man in search of an apartment in Brooklyn in 1972 saw a sign on a building: \""apartment for rent.\"".\n\""He met with the superintendent, and the superintendent said, \\'I\\'m very sorry, but the apartment is rented \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\'s gone,\\' \"" Morse says. \""So the gentlemen said to him, \\'Well, why is the sign out? I still see a sign that says apartment for rent.\\' And the superintendent said, \\'Oh, I guess I forgot to take it down.\\' \"".\nWhen Morse went to the building to ask about the same apartment, she says, \""They greeted me with open arms and showed me every aspect of the apartment.\"".\nMorse says she reported her experience to the Human Rights Commission, and then returned to the apartment building. After she was offered a lease, the black man who had tried to rent the apartment entered the office with a city human rights commissioner, and the three of them confronted the building superintendent.\n\""He said, \\'Well, I\\'m only doing what my boss told me to do \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I am not allowed to rent to black tenants,\\' \"" Morse says.\nWashington Post reporter Michael Kranish, co-author of the book Trump Revealed , tells NPR\\'s Robert Siegel that the Justice Department considered the case \""one of the most significant race bias cases\"" at the time.\nIt was a suit that was directly against them, and it is one that Donald Trump to this day clearly is upset about. .\n\""They signed what was called a consent order,\"" Kranish says. \""Trump fought the case for two years. ... He says it was very easy, but actually he fought the case for two years.\"".\nThe Trumps took essentially the first settlement offer the federal government provided, Kranish says; the Trumps did not, in fact, have to admit guilt in settling the suit.\n\""[The settlement] required the Trumps to place ads in newspapers saying that they welcomed black applicants,\"" Kranish says. \""It said that the Trumps would familiarize themselves with the Fair Housing Act, which prohibited discrimination. So it also specifically said they don\\'t admit wrongdoing, but they did have to take several measures that the Trumps had fought for two years not to take.\"".\nTrump claims the Justice Department lawsuit was just one of many housing cases against many landlords, but Kranish says this description is misleading.\n\""Well, there were cases brought against various companies, but the point here is that Trump has said in the debate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he also told me when I interviewed him at Trump Tower earlier this year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that this was part of one massive suit.\"" Kranish says, \""And in fact, this very specifically is a case that charges Donald Trump, Fred Trump and their company of race bias in housing rentals. ...

It was moderated by Lester Holt of NBC, it took place on September 26, 2016, in Hempstead, New York. .\nLester Holt: ( 00:07 ) Good evening, from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I\u2019m Lester Holt, anchor of NBC Nightly News. I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight\u2019s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90 minute debate is divided into six segments, each 50 minutes long. We\u2019ll explore three topic areas tonight, achieving prosperity, America\u2019s direction, and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead off question to both candidates and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we\u2019ll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. We\u2019ll invite you to applaud. However, at this moment, as we walk on the candidates, Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee for President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. .\nLester Holt: ( 01:48 ) [inaudible 00:01:48] Good luck to you. Well, I don\u2019t expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight. But I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important. And we\u2019re going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates. And just as important to the American people. Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So let\u2019s begin. We\u2019re calling this opening segment, achieving prosperity and central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There\u2019s been a record, six straight years of job growth and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation, however, income inequality remains significant and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton. Why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American workers? .\nHillary Clinton: ( 02:51 ) Thank you, Lester and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\u2019ll build together. Today is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs and infrastructure in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work. I also want to see more companies do profit sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. .\nHillary Clinton: ( 03:56 ) And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I\u2019ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\u2019re under. So let\u2019s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let\u2019s be sure we have affordable childcare and debt-free college. How are we going to do it? We\u2019re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it\u2019s good to be with you. We\u2019re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us. Who can shoulder the immense awesome responsibilities of the presidency? Who can put into action the plans that will make your life better? I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th. .\nLester Holt: ( 04:55 ) Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It\u2019s about putting money, more money, into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes. .\nDonald Trump: ( 05:02 ) Thank you. Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They\u2019re going to Mexico. They\u2019re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They\u2019re devaluing their currency and there\u2019s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight, because they\u2019re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we\u2019re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what\u2019s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said, it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world, that building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that. Their small car division leaving, thousands of jobs. Leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio, they\u2019re all leaving, and we can\u2019t allow it to happen anymore. .\nDonald Trump: ( 05:59 ) As far as childcare is concerned. And so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we\u2019re going to do, but perhaps we\u2019ll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and with it firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier Air Conditioning in Indianapolis, they fired 1400 people. They\u2019re going to Mexico. So many, hundreds and hundreds, of companies are doing this. We can not let it happen. .\nDonald Trump: ( 06:39 ) Under my plan, I\u2019ll be reducing taxes tremendously from 35% to 15% for companies, small and big businesses, that\u2019s going to be a job creator like we haven\u2019t seen since Ronald Reagan, it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build, they will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. .\nHillary Clinton: ( 07:13 ) Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5% of the world\u2019s population. We have to trade with the other 95% and we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions and the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version. The biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we\u2019ve ever had. I call it trumped up, trickle down because that\u2019s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what\u2019s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. .\nHillary Clinton: ( 08:06 ) I understand that. Donald was very fortunate in his life and that\u2019s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off we\u2019ll be and that everything will work out from there. I don\u2019t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silk screen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle-class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we\u2019ll grow. That\u2019s the kind of economy I want us to see again. .\nLester Holt: ( 08:56 ) Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can. You\u2019ve talked about creating 25 million jobs and you\u2019ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are we going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How specifically are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back. .\nDonald Trump: ( 09:13 ) Well, for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975. And I built it into a company that\u2019s worth many, many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world. And I say that only because that\u2019s the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country\u2019s in deep trouble. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China, they\u2019re the best, the best ever, at it. What they\u2019re doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And Lester, they\u2019re taking our jobs. They\u2019re giving incentives. They\u2019re doing things that frankly we don\u2019t do. .\nDonald Trump: ( 09:52 ) Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We\u2019re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there\u2019s a tax. When they sell an automatic 16%, approximately. When they sell into us, there\u2019s no tax. It\u2019s a defective agreement. It\u2019s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven\u2019t done anything about it. .\nDonald Trump: ( 10:13 ) Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, I guess. Is that okay? Good. I want you to be very happy. It\u2019s very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently, she\u2019s been doing this for 30 years and why hasn\u2019t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective, just because of the tax and many other reasons. But just because of the tax. .\nDonald Trump: ( 10:39 ) Secretary Clinton and others, politicians should have been doing this for years. Not right now because of the fact that we\u2019ve created a movement, they should have been doing this for years. What\u2019s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. .\nLester Holt: ( 11:02 ) Back to the question though, how do you bring back specifically, bring back jobs? American manufacturers, how do you make them bring the jobs back? .\nDonald Trump: ( 11:09 ) Well, the first thing you do is don\u2019t let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them, they\u2019re leaving and they\u2019re leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say fine. You want to go to Mexico with some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you\u2019re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you\u2019re wrong. And once you say you\u2019re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies. So what I\u2019m saying is we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that\u2019s a big, big factor. .\nHillary Clinton: ( 11:54 ) Well, let\u2019s stop for a second. And remember where we were eight years ago, we had the worst financial crisis, the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said back in 2006, \u201cGee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\u201d Well, it did collapse. .\nHillary Clinton: ( 12:34 ) 9 million people, 9 million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now we have come back from that abyss and it has not been easy. So we\u2019re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy. But the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I\u2019ve proposed and looked at what Donald\u2019s proposed. And basically they\u2019ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would, in some instances, disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy were to go into effect, we would lose three and a half million jobs and maybe have another recession. They\u2019ve looked at my plans and they\u2019ve said, \u201cOkay, if we can do this,\u201d and I intend to get it done, \u201cwe will have 10 million more new jobs,\u201d because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it\u2019s real. .\nHillary Clinton: ( 13:58 ) I think it\u2019s important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad. And here\u2019s what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That\u2019s a lot of jobs. That\u2019s a lot of new economic activity. So I\u2019ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do. And I am determined that we\u2019re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we\u2019ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place. .\nDonald Trump: ( 14:33 ) She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country, that was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now look, I\u2019m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we\u2019re putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can\u2019t do what you\u2019re looking to do with 20 trillion in debt. .\nDonald Trump: ( 14:59 ) The Obama administration, from the time they\u2019ve come in, is over 230 years worth of debt. And he\u2019s topped it. He\u2019s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven and a half years to be semi exact. So I will tell you this, we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentive to build new companies or to expand because they\u2019re not doing it.

Senator Ron Johnson faces accusations from the Congressional Integrity Project that he may have sought a change in the Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2017 tax bill to enrich himself personally.\nRon Johnson, who has led attacks on Joe Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son Hunter, began sale of company months after insisting on change of tax law.\nRon Johnson, the senator from Wisconsin who has led the Republican campaign in the Senate of making unfounded claims about Joe Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son Hunter, is facing a host of questions about his own ethics, including whether he personally benefited from a change in tax law that he sought in 2017.\nA letter sent by Johnson to the Senate ethics committee in May has revealed the senator began the process of selling a company he partly owned in February 2018, just months after he insisted the Trump administration change a portion of the tax law in a way that ultimately benefited the sale.\nThe issue has become a focus of the Congressional Integrity Project, a Democratic watchdog group that is seeking to expose allegations of corruption within the Republican ranks.\nAt the center of claims made by the watchdog group are allegations that Johnson may have sought out a change in the Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2017 tax bill to enrich himself personally.\nQuestions began swirling around Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sale of stock in Pacur in March, when it was first disclosed. Press reports questioned whether the timing of the sale reflected insider information Johnson had gleaned about the Covid-19 pandemic in his role as head of the Senate homeland security committee. In response to those questions, Johnson sent a letter to the Senate select committee on ethics, saying that he signed an engagement letter with Wells Fargo on 26 February 2018 to act as an adviser and investment banker to find an investment partner or acquirer for Pacur. The statement seemed to rule out that the sale had any connection to Covid-19.\nBut the revelation raised a host of other questions. Four months earlier, Johnson became the first Republican senator to announce that he would vote against Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax bill if it did not give better treatment to so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpass-through\\xe2\\x80\\x9d entities, or companies that are taxed at rates for individual taxpayers but whose profits are distributed to owners. Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s threat paid off and a change to improve the tax rate for pass-throughs was added to the law, which Johnson supported.\nThe change was recognized at the time as increasing the value of pass-through entities. Johnson sold his stock in his own pass-through company, Pacur, a plastics company he previously ran with is brother-in-law, on 2 March 2020, generating profits of as much as $25m on the sale. In 2017, Johnson said his stake was worth between $1m and $5m.\nIn a new report, the Congressional Integrity Project \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which does not release the names of its funders \\xe2\\x80\\x93 also suggests that Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adult children have benefited from his public role. It said that Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three adult children purchased a building in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in 2017 using a trust set up by their parents. The building later won historic designation from the Wisconsin Historical Society \\xe2\\x80\\x93 making it eligible for tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though the process bypassed Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own State Historic Preservation Office.\nWhile the project ought to have been ineligible for tax credits because construction was being performed on the property before its application to the Wisconsin Register of Historic Places was completed, that policy appears to have been set aside in the case of the new event space, called The Howard.\nEmails obtained by the Congressional Integrity Project show that an official from the preservation office said he did not want to make the situation difficult for the buyers because of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnicality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and because the buyers \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforgot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the WEDC application.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlso an FYI in case you do not recognize the owner Carey Sharpe is Senator Ron Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said an email from Mark Buechel, a senior preservation architect for the State Historic Preservation Office, to a colleague.\nThe tax credits were approved, the Congressional Integrity Project claimed, shortly before the then governor, Scott Walker, lowered the tax credits available for projects like The Howard.\nA spokesman for Johnson denied that Johnson was involved in his children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business and shrugged off claims that the tax change he sought may have helped the senator personally.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you aware that 96% of all businesses in America are pass-through businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the corner coffee shop, the auto shop, your hair salon, etc \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that Senator Johnson was seeking more equitable treatment for them in light of the tax cuts C-corp businesses (like Amazon, Apple, GM, etc.) were getting?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the spokesman said.\nThe person added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFar from the scandal you seem to imply, pass-through income is taxed on a business owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal return. Before the 2017 reform, it was taxed at the same rate as other earned income \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in Senator Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, that would be the highest tax bracket, one that even now is 37%. What he won for that 96% of all businesses that are pass-through is that their business earnings now face a top tax rate of 30% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 still far above the 21% top rate levied on C-corps, but less of a disadvantage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nJohnson has led a campaign in the Senate to launch unfounded allegations against Joe Biden\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son, Hunter.

Ron Johnson on defense in the home stretch of the midterms, the Wisconsin conservative is suddenly under the microscope on a social issue that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rarely focused on during his decade-plus in office. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s far from clear whether he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take that baby step to the center ahead of a November contest against Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opened a slight lead in public polls. .\nJohnson surprised many fellow senators last month when he said he saw \\xe2\\x80\\x9c no reason \\xe2\\x80\\x9d to oppose what he described as unnecessary House-passed legislation designed to protect same-sex marriage, which could come to the floor as soon as next month. Then, when pressed later, he hedged on whether he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d vote yes or merely present.

The [same-sex marriage bill] is just another example of Democrats creating a state of fear over a settled issue in order to further divide Americans for their political benefit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d CityBase Screendoor .\nBacking the same-sex marriage bill, which Schumer has vowed to call a vote on without committing to a time frame, would be an unusually bipartisan move for the MAGA-world favorite. And if Johnson does vote yes, it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the only front where he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s avoiding the unpopular side of a major issue: Asked recently by POLITICO if Donald Trump should seek another term, the senator demurred that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to the former president. .\nTaking up same-sex marriage legislation in September would give Democrats a plum opportunity to squeeze Johnson on an issue that more than 70 percent of Americans support, weeks before he faces off against Barnes. Even so, Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Democratic home-state colleague, Sen. Tammy Baldwin \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading the effort to get the 10 Republican votes necessary to avoid a filibuster \\xe2\\x80\\x94 isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t counting on him to bring it home. .\nNo matter where Johnson falls on the same-sex marriage bill, Democrats and Republicans alike underscored that the onetime Tea Party icon and occasional GOP gadfly isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about to execute a full rebrand or centrist makeover. Yet as he trails Barnes in recent public polling, with one survey showing him behind by seven points, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t appear eager to hand Democrats a line of attack on social policy that has never been the center of his attention, especially when his favorability rating is already underwater. .\n Wisconsin Lt. Gov. and Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Mandela Barnes speaks at a rally at John Marshall High School Friday in Milwaukee, July 15, 2022. | Morry Gash/AP Photo .\nJohnson hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t taken a high-profile position on same-sex marriage in some time. During his 2010 Senate bid, Johnson said on his campaign website that marriage is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbetween one man and one woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He said in 2014 that he maintained that view but told CNBC that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif the voters decide that they want gay marriage, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to oppose it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nSame-sex marriage is unlikely to play a decisive role in the Wisconsin Senate race, where inflation remains a top issue, followed by gun violence, crime and abortion, according to a recent poll from Marquette Law School. But that same survey also holds warnings for Republicans: Sixty percent of registered Wisconsin voters oppose the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to overturn while 33 percent support it. Among the independents who are key to a Johnson or Barnes victory, 62 percent oppose the reversal and 31 percent back it.\nThe poll also found that nearly two-thirds of Wisconsin voters don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to see Trump run in 2024, though a majority of Republicans do, putting Johnson in a bind in the general election.\nIndeed, abortion remains the centerpiece of Democratic messaging against Johnson with Barnes hitting him as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cputting women and doctors at risk by supporting a federal abortion ban.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d When asked to clarify his stance on a federal abortion ban, Johnson suggested it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up to the states for now but that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaybe sometime in the future, there might be a role for Congress again to try to bring maybe a little more order to the process.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBut Democrats contend that same-sex marriage falls within the same umbrella as abortion rights, putting Johnson and other Republicans on the back foot with women and independent voters.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is part of a picture that people are painting about Republicans, that they are extreme on a wide variety of issues,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe problem for Republicans is they actually are extreme so it becomes pretty difficult, two-and-a-half months before the election, for [Arizona GOP Senate nominee] Blake Masters or Ron Johnson to suddenly position themselves as center-right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nMaddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for Barnes, referred to same-sex marriage and abortion as she slammed Johnson for \\xe2\\x80\\x9crefusing to stand up for our rights and freedoms,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adding that he is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cout of touch with working people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nMeanwhile, Republican consultants interviewed didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see a broader strategy behind Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s noncommittal stance on the same-sex marriage bill. One suggested it was as simple as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was on his mind that day, and a reporter asked him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBill McCoshen, a Wisconsin-based GOP strategist, said that Johnson is a true \\xe2\\x80\\x9clibertarian\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on same-sex marriage and predicted he would back the legislation if \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafted correctly in the way he could support.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nBaldwin and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) are currently working on an amendment that seeks to attract more GOP votes by emphasizing that the bill will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot take away any religious liberty or conscience protections,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d according to Baldwin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spokesperson. But Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is drafting his own competing proposal that his office said would seek to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprohibit the federal government from discriminating against persons based on their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions about marriage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\nWhich leaves Republicans to count on voter worries about a lousy economy, and social issues receding from the headlines, to help carry Johnson to a third term. They argue he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been down in the polls in previous cycles, only to make a fall comeback and win.\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the economy is worse in October \\xe2\\x80\\x94 gas prices being higher, inflation being higher or at least consistently high \\xe2\\x80\\x94 social issues are not going to be front and center,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said McCoshen. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDemocrats are trying to make them front and center right now when there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little bit of relief on gas prices. ...

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is calling President Biden a liar after being repeatedly characterized as a Republican seeking to end key entitlement programs.\nDuring his Wednesday speech in Madison, Wisconsin, Biden acknowledged the \""spirited debate\"" he had with House Republicans during the State of the Union address Tuesday night \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and others booed and shouted that he was a \""liar\"" for claiming Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare entitlements.\nRefusing to back down at the Wisconsin rally, the president pulled out a brochure with the 12-point plan to \""Rescue America\"" put forward by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., which Biden and Democrats have asserted lays out a proposal that would to end without Congressional action.\nThe president then read a placard with a 2022 quote from Johnson, in which the Republican lawmaker called for Social Security and Medicare entitlements to be transitioned from mandatory to discretionary spending, which would require Congress to budget for those programs annually.\nPresident Biden holds a copy of a Sen. Rick Scott proposal during a speech Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023, in Wisconsin. (Fox News).\nBiden\\'s accusation was in reference to August 2022, when Johnson suggested that Social Security and Medicare should no longer exist as federal entitlement programs. Johnson specified that he believed the programs should instead be approved annually as discretionary spending.\n\""If you qualify for the entitlement, you just get it no matter what the cost,\"" Johnson said at the time. \""And our problem in this country is that more than 70% of our federal budget, of our federal spending, is all mandatory spending. It\\'s on automatic pilot. It never, you just don\\'t do proper oversight.

He lied last night, and he lied again today. I never suggested putting Medicare & Social Security on the chopping block.

The envelope has warnings of criminal penalties for anyone who fraudulently endorses the check. It also warns that if the recipient is deceased, the check should be placed in the return mail. The distinctive green checks feature an engraving of the Statue of Liberty and the Treasury Seal. (NoDerog).\nWhen pushing his bill as a senator, Biden said \""it requires every program to be looked at freshly at least once every four years.\"".\n\""I want to save these programs. I have simply pointed out the greatest threat to these programs is out of control debt and deficits.

He even backed gargling mouthwash to ward off the novel coronavirus, forcing Listerine to intervene . In more conventional political stupidity, he\\'s also backed breaking the nation\\'s promises to its seniors that they can depend on Medicare and Social Security.\nAnd last May, Johnson had this to say: \""Regarding reports that I received an FBI briefing warning me that I was a target of Russian disinformation, I can confirm I received such a briefing in August of 2020,\"" he told the Washington Post . He added that the briefers didn\\'t provide him with specific evidence of this, so he dismissed the \""defensive briefing\"" as a scheme orchestrated by Democrats and the media. (In entirely unrelated news, Johnson returned from a trip with a Republican delegation to Moscow for the Fourth of July in 2018 to say the impact of Russia\\'s election meddling had been overblown and Congress should reevaluate the sanctions it levied in response. His colleagues on that trip did not share this sentiment, and it was Johnson\\'s comments that got a re-airing on Russian state media.).\nAnyway, Johnson is running for re-election at the moment, and in a debate Thursday night , his Democratic opponent Mandela Barnes brought up that FBI briefing. Johnson\\'s response was...something.\nThis content is imported from twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\nNot a good sign when the audience is cackling at you. If you\\'re going to allege a conspiracy against you, it helps not to sound like some guy on a street corner. (By the way, there\\'s no indication that Johnson thought he was working in Russia\\'s interests or did so on purpose. See also. ) But again we get this fascinating view of the FBI from Republican officeholders: that the famously liberal Bureau, led by a director appointed by Trump, was out to frame Republicans as Russian agents. Or maybe these G-men went rogue, in Johnson\\'s estimation, because they just hate Trump and love Joe Biden so much? It\\'s strange to hear in a week where we learned that, according to an email to FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate from a redacted source , \""there is, at best, a sizeable percentage of the employee population that felt sympathetic to the group that stormed the Capitol.\"".\nRemember that stuff about our last shred of freedom? Ten years on from Johnson\\'s comments, Obamacare is still around\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and quite popular \\xe2\\x80\\x94and we still seem to have a democratic republic. That\\'s no thanks to Johnson, of course, who peddled the lie that the election was stolen.

Rick Scott wants Florida lawmakers to revisit the 2011 elections overhaul , which was widely blamed for problems with early voting during last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s presidential election. In an interview on Miami-based WPLG Channel 10, Scott stressed he wants local supervisors to have the option to implement the most early voting hours in Florida history. \""What I think we ought to be doing is give the flexibility to our supervisors of elections, most of them, as you know, are elected county by county, but say you can do anywhere from eight to 14 days, six to 12 hours a day,\"" Scott said in the Jan. 18, 2013, interview, \""so a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had.\"" Scott, who refused to extend early voting in 2012 despite long lines at some polls, is also calling on the Legislature to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day -- the day when African-American groups hosted popular \""Souls to the Polls\"" events. Here we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll examine whether Scott is right to say his proposal would be the most hours for early voting. Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history with early voting is short. Former Gov. Jeb Bush signed early voting into law in 2004. That law required early voting to start 15 days before an election , with at least eight hours per weekday and eight hours total for each weekend. Voters had 104 early voting hours. Even though election supervisors asked for more hours and more locations, Bush and the GOP-led Legislature passed a new law in 2005 that reduced hours and confined voting to election offices, city halls and libraries. Under the new law, early voting lasted 14 days, for eight hours on weekdays and a total of eight hours on the weekend. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 96 hours. In the 2008 presidential election, voters had more time to vote early thanks to an emergency extension \\xc2\\xa0ordered by Gov. Charlie Crist (read that executive order .) Many news accounts put the total number of early voting hours in 2008 at 120, but the Department of State calculates it at 116. In 2011, the Legislature passed a sweeping elections law \\xc2\\xa0that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. (Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a related check \\xc2\\xa0on that.) So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. The Legislature is poised to tweak the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s early voting system again in 2013 because of the long waits to vote in some places during the 2012 presidential election. Scott, echoing proposals from the elections supervisors association, recommended the Legislature give supervisors the ability to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. He also wants to add more early voting sites. So under Scott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). On the flip side, the fewest number of hours they would be required to offer is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours). Activists behind the liberal campaign Pink Slip Rick disapproved of Scott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal, saying Scott should have restored the number of days for early voting to 14, the way it was before the 2011 election law. \""Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting,\"" said Amy Ritter, executive director of Florida Watch Action, the liberal group behind Pink Slip Rick. A few election supervisors we interviewed about Scott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan said they welcomed the idea of tailoring early voting to their home county\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs. \""We kind of came to the conclusion that obviously, with Florida being such a huge and diverse state, one size does not fit all,\"" said Brian Corley, Pasco County supervisor of elections. Corley, who heads up legislative affairs for the state supervisors association, said he does not think Pasco would need the full 168 hours, but \""it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice to have the option, if need be, for a major presidential election.\"" A spokeswoman for Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes said her office had not yet begun planning for the scenario under Scott\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan but would probably go back to 14 days of early voting, the way things were before the Legislature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2011 law. \""We would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to HB 1355,\"" said public services director Mary Cooney in an email. Our ruling.\n Scott said that his proposal would allow \""a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had\"" for early voting. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right that his proposal would give supervisors of elections the option to offer 168 hours of early voting, and that would be a record.\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\n We should note that supervisors would also have the option to only offer 48 hours of voting, which is less than previous law. But Scott was very careful with his wording, noting that 168 hours was the maximum and outlining the specific days and hours.\n A claim from his critics, Pink Slip Rick, said the law \""only mandates 48 hours of early voting.\"" We rated that Mostly True , because it didn\\'t leave open the possibility of more hours.

Memos from 2008 and 2009 obtained by Wikileaks strongly suggest, but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prove without a doubt, that the State Department helped block the proposed minimum wage increase. The memos show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage hike and met multiple times with factory owners who directly lobbied against it to the Haitian president.\nIn 2011, Wikileaks made nearly 2,000 cables available to the progressive magazine, The Nation, \\xc2\\xa0 and Haiti Libert\\xc3\\xa9 , a weekly newspaper in Port-au-Prince. \\xc2\\xa0.\nThe two media outlets assessed the cables and found, among many other revelations , that the \""U.S. Embassy in Haiti worked closely with factory owners contracted by Levi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom to aggressively block a paltry minimum wage increase\"" for workers in apparel factories.\nThe Wikileaks cables show U.S. Embassy officials began monitoring the minimum wage issue as early as 2008, when the Haitian Parliament began discussing doubling or tripling the daily minimum wage of 70 Haitian gourdes to keep up with inflation. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s roughly equal to $1.75 a day, or about 22 cents per hour.\n(Some context here: Three quarters of Haitians live on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 World Food Program , while garments constitute about 90 percent of Haiti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exports, according to the Guardian . Haiti increased the daily minimum wage to the equivalent of $5.11 in 2014.).\nBut back in 2008 and 2009, embassy officials repeatedly told Washington that a hike would hurt the economy and undermine U.S. trade preference legislation known as HOPE.\nThe program, shorthand for the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, gives garments manufactured on the island duty free access to U.S. markets. Levi Strauss, Haneswear, Nautica, and Dockers are just some of the American companies that benefit from HOPE. Congress passed HOPE II in 2008, extending the program for another 10 years.\nIn January 2008, Ambassador Janet Sanderson wrote that representatives of the business community \\xe2\\x80\\x94 including the man tasked with implementing HOPE \\xe2\\x80\\x94 had met with embassy officials and criticized Haitian President Ren\\xc3\\xa9 Pr\\xc3\\xa9val\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to raise the minimum wage as the wrong medicine for the ailing economy.\nAn unsigned embassy cable sent to Washington in December 2008 echoed the private sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assessment and reported that increasing the minimum wage would \""have significant impact\"" on business.\nThe State Department continued to promote HOPE as an economic boon for the island. In memos prepping U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and Clinton for their visits to Haiti, charg\\xc3\\xa9 d\\'affaires Thomas Tighe told the diplomats to \""urge\"" \\xc2\\xa0the Haitian government take advantage of HOPE and HOPE II.\nAfter advising a congressional delegation to Haiti almost exactly the same thing, Sanderson told Washington that Haitian Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis was onboard with HOPE, \""although pending legislation to nearly triple the minimum wage would likely set back those efforts in the short term.\"".\nDeputy Chief of Mission David Lindwall put it most bluntly, when he said the minimum wage law \""did not take economic reality into account but that appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.\"".\nNonetheless, the Haitian Parliament voted to triple the daily minimum wage to 200 gourdes ($5 a day, or about 62 cents per hour) in May 2009. As the bill awaited President Pr\\xc3\\xa9val\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signature, students protested over the delay while factory owners criticized the legislation.\nThe U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, continued to lament the hike and raised concerns about the stability of the region that they hoped Pr\\xc3\\xa9val would help address, according to the cables. Pr\\xc3\\xa9val, as they say, leaned in.\nSanderson, in a June 10 memo , cited a study by the Haitian Association of Industry (ADIH) stating that the new minimum wage \""would result in the loss of 10,000 workers in the sector\"" and noted that ADIH has met with Pr\\xc3\\xa9val three times.\n\""A more visible and active engagement by Pr\\xc3\\xa9val may be critical to resolving the issue of the minimum wage and its protest \\xe2\\x80\\x98spin-off\\' \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or risk the political environment spiraling out of control,\"" she wrote.\nOn June 17 , Tighe told Washington that industry and USAID studies found that a 200 gourdes minimum wage \""would make the sector economically unviable and consequently force factories to shut down.\"".\nHe also noted that ADIH members and HOPE factory owners told U.S. officials that in lieu of greenlighting the legislation as is, Pr\\xc3\\xa9val would instead propose a lower, phased-in minimum wage for the textiles sector (100 gourdes in 2009, 125 gourdes in 2010, and 150 gourdes in 2011).\nProtesters continued to call for Pr\\xc3\\xa9val to sign the original bill, with some demonstrations escalating into violence, as parliament considered the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amendments.\nIn a June 24 cable to a congressional delegation, Tighe said the demonstrations added uncertainty to the political and security situation in Haiti and \\xc2\\xa0\""job creation under HOPE II may be threatened by a bill Parliament passed May 5 to nearly triple the minimum wage.\"".\nWhen the delegation met with Pr\\xc3\\xa9val the next day, the president parroted this line and encouraged the congressmen \""to write to Haitian members of Parliament to express concern about the devastating impact a sector-wide increase in wages would have on job security and job creation,\"" according to a memo from Tighe .\nBy July, Pr\\xc3\\xa9val was a formal and vocal opponent of the 200 gourds wage, warning of the consequences for jobs and emphasizing the importance of the assembly sector for exports, according to cables.\n\""This is the only issue in recent memory where the president has made a strong effort, by negotiating with stakeholders and using the media, to effect a legislative outcome,\"" Tighe said .\nIn the fall of 2009, Pr\\xc3\\xa9val and Parliament agreed to enact the $5 daily wage for all sectors except textiles, which got a $3 wage. But was the State Department right in opposing the increase?.\n\""I have no idea what would happen if Haiti did have a $5-a-day minimum wage,\"" Adam Davidson of NPR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Planet Money said in 2011. \""But I do think it\\'s reasonable to assume that some factories would close and far fewer new ones would be built. Far fewer Haitians would be allowed to take that first tentative step on to the ladder of industrial development.\"".\nCamp said, \""In 2009 ... Hillary Clinton was at the State Dept working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents.\"".\nLeaked cables show that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti opposed the minimum wage hike that the Haitian parliament passed in 2009, and discussed the issue with business groups.\nHowever, the cables do not contain conclusive evidence that the State Department actively pressured Haiti to block the increase nor do they prove that Clinton personally played a role.\nUpdate, April 21, 2016:\\xc2\\xa0 After we published this fact-check, the State Department told us it had no public, official position in the Haitian minimum wage debate.\n\""The U.S. Department of State did not officially oppose or support the three-step proposed minimum wage increases in Haiti \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in 2009, 2010, and 2012 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as this was an internal matter,\"" a spokesperson said.\nThe State Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public stance does not alter the content of the memos, however. They show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage increase.\n Says Melania Trump\u2019s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. .\n The language that's part of the president's National Security Council memo \""is identical to the language\"" used by President George W. Bush in 2001 and President Barack Obama in 2009. .\n \""My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.\"" .\n \""One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases.

House Speaker Michael Madigan appeared at a House committee hearing to introduce new legislation that adds specific language on sexual harassment to state employee and lobbyist ethics laws. It also sets up required training and reporting procedures on sexual harassment for state elected officials, lobbyists and employees. But another speaker at the same hearing said this action, though laudable, was arriving far too late. In emotional testimony, crime victim advocate Denise Rotheimer delivered detailed allegations of improper behavior toward her by Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago, as she worked with him to get a bill passed in the legislature. Rotheimer described a circuitous path as she tried to file a complaint about Silverstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alleged harassment only to see her case gather dust. Normally, such complaints would go to the Office of Legislative Inspector General, but there has been no legislative inspector general since Dec. 31, 2014 . It was the responsibility of the House and Senate to fill the vacancy, but it never got done.\nMadigan, however, said the lack of an inspector general for just shy of three years was no cause for alarm. \""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regrettable that we have not had an inspector general, but I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to know that the Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function,\"" Madigan said. He said the ethics commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive director, Randy Erford, \""has provided for the commission to continue to function\"" and had fielded 26 complaints since 2015. Madigan also said the commission is empowered to appoint a temporary inspector general, but had not done so.\nThis made little sense to us. How could the ethics commission \""continue to function\"" in any meaningful way if there was no one to investigate complaints of ethical violations brought to it? Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the primary purpose of any ethics commission to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations? And if it was functioning, why did Rotheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case languish until she went public with her allegations?.\nWe should note up front that no sooner did Madigan conclude his testimony than lawmakers moved swiftly to get an inspector general in place. In a meeting on Saturday, Nov. 4, the eight-member Legislative Ethics Commission voted unanimously to appoint former Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie B. Porter as temporary legislative inspector general through June 30.\nSo Illinois now has someone to receive and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Just three days later, on Nov. 7, the General Assembly passed legislation revising the ethics code that applies to elected officials, state employees and lobbyists to include clear language specifying behavior that qualifies as sexual harassment. It also waived the one-year statute of limitations that would have nullified complaints filed more than a year before Porter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment.\nA day after Rotheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony, Silverstein stepped down from his Majority Caucus Chair leadership post -- which added $20,649 to Silverstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual base pay of $67,836 -- as Cullerton prepared to remove him.\nBut none of this erases the nearly three-year void in which no one was assigned to field and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers.\nAs described on the Legislative Ethics Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website and in Illinois statutes, the duties of the commission rely heavily on the presence of a Legislative Inspector General. This includes conducting administrative hearings and making rulings \""only upon the receipt of pleadings filed by the Legislative Inspector General and not upon its own prerogative\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Any other allegations of misconduct received by the Commission from a person other than the Legislative Inspector General shall be referred to the Office of the Legislative Inspector General.\"".\nMadigan said the commission had continued to receive reports -- 26 of them, though published reports said there were 27 -- even when there was no inspector general. But the law makes clear that those allegations were to be referred to the inspector general. Further, the law says the commission can act on cases only after they have gone through the inspector general.\nOther duties listed on the commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s site pertain to administrative functions like publishing manuals and guides, submitting reports, employee training and preparing public information materials on ethics compliance. By law, the commission is required to meet monthly or \""as often as necessary.\"".\nThe office of Legislative Inspector General had been vacant since Jan 1, 2015. Though Illinois law says the legislative inspector general is to be appointed by \""joint resolution of the Senate and the House,\"" lawmakers never filled the vacancy.\nRepublicans had accused Madigan, generally regarded as the most powerful politician in Springfield, if not the entire state, of sandbagging the appointment. Illinois News Network quoted ethics commission member Rep. Chad Hays, R-Catlin, voicing that complaint:.\nOn his Facebook page, Hays said he and another ethics commissioner, Rep. Norine Hammond, pressed for the inspector general position to be filled. \""My read on the matter is that the Speaker has thwarted efforts to finalize this dynamic,\"" Hays said. \""No rationale for foot dragging on this matter is acceptable. The length of time that the position has remained unoccupied is absurd.\"".\nSenate President John Cullerton on Nov. 1 said in a press release that three candidates for the job had turned it down in the past year:.\n\""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our duty to fill that post.

Rotheimer described a circuitous path as she tried to file a complaint about Silverstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alleged harassment only to see her case gather dust. Normally, such complaints would go to the Office of Legislative Inspector General, but there has been no legislative inspector general since Dec. 31, 2014 . It was the responsibility of the House and Senate to fill the vacancy, but it never got done.\nMadigan, however, said the lack of an inspector general for just shy of three years was no cause for alarm. \""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regrettable that we have not had an inspector general, but I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to know that the Legislative Ethics Commission continues to function,\"" Madigan said. He said the ethics commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive director, Randy Erford, \""has provided for the commission to continue to function\"" and had fielded 26 complaints since 2015. Madigan also said the commission is empowered to appoint a temporary inspector general, but had not done so.\nThis made little sense to us. How could the ethics commission \""continue to function\"" in any meaningful way if there was no one to investigate complaints of ethical violations brought to it? Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the primary purpose of any ethics commission to investigate and mete out discipline for ethics violations? And if it was functioning, why did Rotheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case languish until she went public with her allegations?.\nWe should note up front that no sooner did Madigan conclude his testimony than lawmakers moved swiftly to get an inspector general in place. In a meeting on Saturday, Nov. 4, the eight-member Legislative Ethics Commission voted unanimously to appoint former Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie B. Porter as temporary legislative inspector general through June 30.\nSo Illinois now has someone to receive and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers. Just three days later, on Nov. 7, the General Assembly passed legislation revising the ethics code that applies to elected officials, state employees and lobbyists to include clear language specifying behavior that qualifies as sexual harassment. It also waived the one-year statute of limitations that would have nullified complaints filed more than a year before Porter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment.\nA day after Rotheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony, Silverstein stepped down from his Majority Caucus Chair leadership post -- which added $20,649 to Silverstein\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual base pay of $67,836 -- as Cullerton prepared to remove him.\nBut none of this erases the nearly three-year void in which no one was assigned to field and investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers.\nAs described on the Legislative Ethics Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website and in Illinois statutes, the duties of the commission rely heavily on the presence of a Legislative Inspector General. This includes conducting administrative hearings and making rulings \""only upon the receipt of pleadings filed by the Legislative Inspector General and not upon its own prerogative\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Any other allegations of misconduct received by the Commission from a person other than the Legislative Inspector General shall be referred to the Office of the Legislative Inspector General.\"".\nMadigan said the commission had continued to receive reports -- 26 of them, though published reports said there were 27 -- even when there was no inspector general. But the law makes clear that those allegations were to be referred to the inspector general. Further, the law says the commission can act on cases only after they have gone through the inspector general.\nOther duties listed on the commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s site pertain to administrative functions like publishing manuals and guides, submitting reports, employee training and preparing public information materials on ethics compliance. By law, the commission is required to meet monthly or \""as often as necessary.\"".\nThe office of Legislative Inspector General had been vacant since Jan 1, 2015. Though Illinois law says the legislative inspector general is to be appointed by \""joint resolution of the Senate and the House,\"" lawmakers never filled the vacancy.\nRepublicans had accused Madigan, generally regarded as the most powerful politician in Springfield, if not the entire state, of sandbagging the appointment. Illinois News Network quoted ethics commission member Rep. Chad Hays, R-Catlin, voicing that complaint:.\nOn his Facebook page, Hays said he and another ethics commissioner, Rep. Norine Hammond, pressed for the inspector general position to be filled. \""My read on the matter is that the Speaker has thwarted efforts to finalize this dynamic,\"" Hays said. \""No rationale for foot dragging on this matter is acceptable. The length of time that the position has remained unoccupied is absurd.\"".\nSenate President John Cullerton on Nov. 1 said in a press release that three candidates for the job had turned it down in the past year:.\n\""It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our duty to fill that post. I take responsibility for my role in that lapse, and I apologize for it,\"" Cullerton said. \""These corrective actions are a first step in changing an unacceptable culture that has existed for too long.\"".\nMadigan said the Illinois Legislative Ethics Commission continued to function for nearly three years while the Office of Legislative Inspector General was vacant.\nTo the extent that the eight-member commission continued to schedule monthly meetings and\\xc2\\xa0saw to internal matters, it did \""continue to function.\"" This included its executive director receiving numerous reports of alleged ethics violations.\nBut without an inspector general, it could not function in its capacity to take substantive action on alleged ethics violations. This is why Denise Rotheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint saw no action until she went public with her allegations in a House committee hearing.\n#MeToo?\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bIt\u2019s\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bTime\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bto\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bDemand\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8b#NoMore\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bin\\xe2\\x80\\x8b \\xe2\\x80\\x8bIllinois , open letter to Illinois General Assembly, Oct. 24, 2017; accessed Oct. 31-Nov. 7, 2017.\nSenate President announces leadership change, harassment awareness training, anticipated inspector hiring, press release, Senate President John Cullerton, Nov. 1, 2017; accessed Nov. 6-7, 2017.\n \""The candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, \u2018The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.\u2019 \"" .\n These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard.

We need your help. .\n \""There\u2019s actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail.\"" .\nCruz, the Texas Republican seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2018, said in an interview aired June 11, 2018, that when Barack Obama was president, families entering the country were able to stay together because adults were released rather than detained. For longer than that, immigrants entering the country illegally as families were rarely criminally prosecuted , and many parents and children were placed in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported.\nOf late, though, the government has cracked down on parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission. In April 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would go to detention centers, leaving their newly unaccompanied children to be managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\""You know, you think about it, when someone gets arrested for a crime -- let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say an American citizen gets arrested for a crime, for murder, for burglary, for whatever \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re arrested for a crime, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re separated from your children, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re put in prison. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the only caregiver for that child, then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to find alternative care for those children. That is often another family member or, if need be, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a foster family or some other means to care for kids. That is the inevitable consequence of somebody being arrested for a crime.\n\""This is an issue that, I think, the media has largely constructed because what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shifted is that the (President Donald) Trump administration is endeavoring if people cross illegally to arrest them, not to let them go--and so if they have kids, you know, there is actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail.\"".\nWe sought detail about the described order; Maria Jeffrey in Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Senate office told us by email that Cruz was referring to a 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department.\nWe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spot language in the January 1997 agreement in Flores v. Reno that explicitly bars children from staying with parents who have been detained or jailed. ( See our summary of the agreement here .).\n\""Absolutely not,\"" Denise Gilman , who heads an immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said by email, a conclusion also aired by Peter Schey of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights, which was involved in\\xc2\\xa0the litigation that led to the agreement.\nMuzaffar Chishti , a New York lawyer for the Migration Policy Institute, called Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim an \""inverse interpretation\"" of the Flores agreement. \""He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically saying a court order that mandates protecting children is the one that says you must separate families,\"" Chishti said by phone. Put another way, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law said by email that the Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but Su said it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t condone or require the separation of children from parents.\nWe read the agreement, which says it sets out national policy for the detention, release and treatment of minors in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the government agency overseeing immigration matters before Congress after 9/11 reorganized and renamed departments under the new Department of Homeland Security.\n\""The INS,\"" the agreement states, \""shall place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age and special needs\"" provided the minor is poised to make timely appearances before immigration authorities and her or his well-being is protected.\nFor instance, it says INS facilities will provide \""contact with family members who were arrested with the minor\"" and segregate unaccompanied minors from unrelated adults.\nAlso, the agreement says, where the INS finds the detention of a minor isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t required to secure his or her timely appearance, it shall release the minor \""without unnecessary delay.\"" The minor, the agreement says, should be released, in order of preference, to a parent, a legal guardian, an adult relative or an adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian or parent. Subsequent choices, the agreement says, extend to licensed programs or, ultimately, another adult or entity seeking custody as an alternative to long-term custody and when \""family reunification does not appear to be a reasonable possibility.\"".\n The Justice Department has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalling parents that are concerned about what their kids are being taught, they are labeling them terrorists.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\nInstructions to INS \""service officers\"" in the agreement include a section titled \""family reunification,\"" which says: \""Upon taking a minor into custody, the INS, or the licensed program in which the minor is placed, will promptly attempt to reunite the minor with his or her family to permit the release of the minor\"" in accord with the agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order-of-preference list. \""Such efforts at family reunification,\"" the instructions say, \""will continue so long as the minor is in INS or licensed program custody.\"".\nWe asked Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aide to point out the part of the agreement requiring the separation of children from parents. By email, Jeffrey noted the mandate that minors be placed in the \""least restrictive\"" setting and the section about minors being released to family members if possible.\nJeffrey further pointed out that the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 held that the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. In that dispute, over the Obama administration placing children with their parents in family detention centers, the appeals court upheld a lower court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refusal to amend the Flores agreement to accommodate family detention--after which, Su told us, the Obama administration chose to simply release such parents and children.\nJeffrey wrote that Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""point is simple and 100% correct: When the parents are detained, the Flores agreement compels placing the child with another family member or in another less restrictive setting.\"".\nSu alerted us to another arguably influential factor; a 2008 law requires immigration officials holding a minor to transfer the minor to the care of HHS within 72 hours \""after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child,\"" the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 states.\nGilman said Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim misleads in part by suggesting parents are getting shuttled into criminal jails and then children, newly unaccompanied, quickly must be handed off to the refugee resettlement office.\nWhat actually happens, Gilman wrote, is that parents and children are detained in a border facility and children are taken from parents while the family is at the facility, before criminal charges are brought. Next, Gilman wrote, children are taken into custody and away from the facility by refugee resettlement staff. Only then, Gilman said, are the parents criminally prosecuted before being given a sentence of time served, \""which really is just the time spent at the border facility,\"" Gilman said.\nNext, Gilman said, parents are returned to the border facility \""but the child is already gone.\"" At that point, the parents are typically sent to an adult immigration detention facility to spend several months--even if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re successful in passing an asylum screening interview and getting released on bond, Gilman wrote.\nSu called Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim technically correct but misleading in that it leaves the inaccurate impression that the government, by policy and law, has no choice but to separate children from parents.\n\""The Trump administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands were not forced,\"" Su wrote. \""There are multiple ways that separation could be avoided and the nation\\'s interest in immigration adjudication and removal could still be maintained. But the \\xe2\\x80\\x98zero tolerance\\xe2\\x80\\x99 policy of detaining and criminally prosecuting all immigrants, even those who arrived with children, is what has led to this.\"".\nSumming up, Su said the 2008 law, Flores agreement and court rulings effectively bar the government from sending a detained parent and child to an adult prison together. By policy, Su said, the Trump administration made clear it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in favor of releasing parents and children--which left it with the options of sending parents to prison and releasing children or sending parents to prison and sending children to child detention facilities overseen by the government.\nSu said Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim, intimating the government has had no choice but to separate children from parents, also overlooks the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power to release children to other family members or guardians or even to expand family detention centers so long as they fulfill the agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \""least restrictive setting\"" requirement.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0.\n\""So yes,\"" Su said, \""Cruz is right that once you have make the decision to send the parents to jail, separation may be necessary because Flores generally forbids the government from detaining children in jail,\"" Su wrote.\n\""Although given the horrors of separation, and the rumors of children not being reunited with their parents even after removal,\"" Su said, \""it may be that keeping parents and children together in jail would be the \\xe2\\x80\\x98least restrictive setting\\xe2\\x80\\x99 if the other option is separation. It is important to note that, from my reading, neither the Flores settlement nor the litigants and judge involved foresaw that the settlement would lead to separation of parents of children,\"" Su said. \\xc2\\xa0.\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an element of truth to Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation of the 1997 Flores agreement requiring children to be released or placed in least restrictive settings. As he said, children can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be jailed with their parents. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true in any situation in which a parent is sent to jail.\nHowever, the\\xc2\\xa0agreement doesn\\'t mandate the\\xc2\\xa0separations occurring on the border, which have stepped up due to a Trump administration change in enforcement policy. If anything, the agreement focuses on ways to protect immigrant children and to reunite them with their families.\nMOSTLY FALSE \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
