This is especially troubling given that by 2015 the Philadelphia Police Department had instituted all of the corrective measures which it had agreed to in the settlement.<b>BLOOMBERG, on the stop-and-frisk policing policy when he was New York City mayor: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened, however, was it got out of control and when we discovered \xe2\x80\x94 I discovered \xe2\x80\x94 that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of them out.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Democratic debate Wednesday.</b>Bloomberg has defended himself as other Democrats and President Donald Trump have bashed the tactic as racist and unconstitutional. <b>Bloomberg says he ""inherited"" the stop-and-frisk policy and that he ""cut it back by 95%"" by the time he left office.</b><b>The Democratic presidential candidate also made the dubious claim that he cut stop and frisk by ""95%"" during his time as mayor.</b>;<b>Mike Bloomberg Claims He Cut Stop-and-Frisk by 95 Percent \xe2\x80\x94 After Increasing It Sevenfold Bloomberg drastically ramped up an NYPD program to stop and frisk mostly black and Latino men.</b> Now, he\xe2\x80\x99s misleading the public about the history.Time has not been kind to the advocates of stop-and-frisk. Today, crime rates have reached historic lows , and voters have turned their attention elsewhere. <b>Stop-and-frisk is now frequently denounced as unjustified and racist, as it was during the recent presidential campaign of former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg.</b> But that should not be the final word.<b>Questions (Q1): The mayor of a certain town wants 80% of its population to be vaccinated.</b> But she suspects that the true proportion of vaccinated citizens is less than that.

(a) Based on the sample, construct a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of the town's population that is vaccinated.The NYPD has conducted millions of stop-and-frisks in New York City over the last two decades. The majority of those stopped\xc2\xa0are people of color, and a vastly disproportionate number are Black. There is no evidence that ramping up stops makes New Yorkers safer. <b>But we do know that many of these stops have been unlawful and that some have led to violent police misconduct.\xc2\xa0The following is an analysis of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s stop-and-frisk data, including a list of stops by year.</b>Mike Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance in a Democratic presidential debate involved him fending off attacks on his record on the stop-and-frisk policy in New York. <b>The former mayor said too many people were stopped and that he\xe2\x80\x99s apologized for it, but he also claimed that stops were cut back drastically once he learned about it.</b>Data shows that police disproportionately targeted African Americans and Latinos. <b>A federal judge in 2013 ruled that the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk tactics violated the constitutional rights of minorities in the city.</b>;Perhaps the most startling finding of the ACLU report is that during the summer of 2014, CPD conducted more than a quarter million stops of civilians that did not lead to an arrest. <b>When comparing that number of stops to population in Chicago versus New York City at the height of that city\xe2\x80\x99s controversial use of the stop-and-frisk practice, Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as often as people in New York.</b> Stops per 1000 residents was 93.6 in Chicago, compared to 22.9 (at the highest point in 2011) in New York City. The New York police have been forced to curb significantly their use of stop-and-frisk after a federal judge found the use in that city to be unconstitutional.This electronic database was implemented in January 2014. On Feb. 24, the ACLU-PA released its fifth court-mandated report concluding that the data still reflects high levels of unlawful stops, with 39 percent of stop and frisks being conducted without reasonable suspicion. <b>Previous reports have shown that the excessive and unlawful practice of stop and frisk has improved in recent years; data from 2011 showed that 50 percent of stop and frisks were conducted without reasonable suspicion.</b> Despite this decline in unlawful stop and frisks, ACLU-PA continues to threaten further legal action and calls for greater accountability measures for the PPD: “Without strong accountability measures, the high level of violations of constitutional rights will likely continue.” Read more about Sunlight’s work with criminal justice data.By now it’s well known that stop-and-frisk disproportionately targets Black and Latino communities. But the policy is even more destructive than you think. To see how stop-and-frisk was implemented, we looked at the raw NYPD data on stop-and-frisk in 2011. <b>That was the peak year for stop-and-frisk in New York City, when police made 685,724 stops—almost 2,000 stops every single day.</b>;",0,8,6

Randy Price , No: 2:22-cr-00097 (decision below).;<b>This article is about background checks for private sales of firearms in the United States.</b> <b>For background checks in general, see Background check .</b><b>Instead, research suggests universal background checks can be effective when combined with licensing strategies, such as permit-to-purchase.</b> <b>With permit-to-purchase, a gun buyer must pass a background check to obtain a permit to then purchase a firearm.</b> Regulated and unregulated gun markets .<b>Universal background checks are popular and enjoy political momentum.</b> Poll after poll shows they win near-universal approval. According to a Quinnipiac University poll conducted immediately after the school shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, 97 percent of American voters said they approved of the policy, with identical levels of support among respondents living in households with a gun.<b>Proponents of \xe2\x80\x9cUniversal\xe2\x80\x9d background checks claim the measure solves the problem of access to firearms by prohibited persons but the glaring problem with \xe2\x80\x9cUniversal Background Checks\xe2\x80\x9d is they are unenforceable without a mandatory national firearm registry, which federal law expressly prohibits.</b> Law abiding gun owners are well aware that historically firearm registration leads to confiscation.State and local officials can implement higher age restrictions on gun ownership but cannot implement lower age restrictions on gun ownership. \xe2\x80\x9cRight to carry\xe2\x80\x9d laws that determine whether a person can carry guns in public are decided by state and local governments. <b>Background checks for gun purchases.</b><b> Poll: Most gun owners favor modest restrictions but deeply distrust government Overwhelming majorities want to see universal background checks, raising the age to buy any kind of gun to 21 and red flag laws.</b> But just a quarter trust the government to look out for them.The increase in partisanship in the U.S. over the last several decades has made it much harder for legislators to compromise and enact change on a variety of issues. One of these issues is gun control, where Americans are split along ideological, geographical, and socioeconomic lines. This divide makes it extremely tough for legislators to enact legislation to curb the multitudes of suicides, murders, and mass shootings due to gun violence. <b>But while there exists a lot of disagreement over many gun control policies, there is one that Americans in wide margins agree on and that is the necessity of universal background checks.</b><b>The new rule also requires gun dealers to give serial numbers to any firearms in their inventory that do not currently have serial numbers, regardless of how the firearm was made.</b><b>Most hunters know that purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer requires the purchaser to pass a background check conducted through the federal instant check system.</b> <b>In many states, however, purchasers can also buy guns in private transactions that do not require the buyer to pass a background check.</b><b>Currently, Federal law requires that someone with a Federal Firearms License (FFL) must conduct a background check before transferring a gun to someone.</b> A transfer can include selling, loaning, giving, etc. <b>So, if you buy a gun from a gun store, pawn shop, or other similar establishment, you must submit to a background check.</b><b> Why the battle for universal background checks for gun sales is so complicated What exactly is a \'universal background check\' for gun sales,and why has it been so hard for federal legislation to mandate such checks?</b><b>""The claim we looked at from Senator Fitzgerald was that any universal background checks involve gun owners having to submit their serial numbers to state and federal officials,"" said Greg Borowski with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.</b><b>Background checks are the foundation of any comprehensive gun violence prevention strategy.</b> <b>Current federal law requires that background checks be conducted whenever a person attempts to buy a gun from a licensed gun dealer.</b> This is to ensure that the buyer is not legally prohibited from having the gun.<b>In order to sell a gun, all U.S. licensed gun dealers must run a potential purchaser through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, a provision based in a federal law that was passed in 1993.</b><b>Current federal law requires background checks to be performed for anyone purchasing a firearm at a federally licensed gun dealer–however only 40% of guns sold in the US are sold through a federally licensed dealer.</b><b>Universal background checks would close the loophole that currently allows prohibited purchasers to acquire guns by requiring background checks on all gun sales and transfers between private parties, including at gun shows and online.</b> <b>Universal background checks act as the foundation for other evidence-based gun violence prevention policies that will work together to make gun violence rare and abnormal in all communities.</b> <b>Congress should pass universal background checks, thus requiring every individual wishing to purchase or transfer a gun to undergo a background check, with certain limited exceptions.</b> <b>In the absence of federal action, states should continue to pass their own universal background check laws.</b><b> Not saying I\xe2\x80\x99m for universal background checks but as far as I can tell it will just extend background checks to private sales (which if I\xe2\x80\x99m correct (and i certainty may not be) are already state mandated by some states).</b><b> Universal background checks involve asking people ""to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official,"" and that violates the Second Amendment.</b>;",0,7,1

This spike was particularly acute in major cities across the country.Lawmakers from both parties have come to realize that locking people up is an expensive, ineffective means to fight crime. Some conservative states like Texas have led the way, undoing many of the harsh policies passed in the 1980s and 1990s. <b>States have seen their prison populations and crime rates decline simultaneously.</b> Unfortunately, however, both President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are stout reform opponents, threatening the small progress that’s been made.<b> Crime Has Declined Overall During The Pandemic, But Shootings And Killings Are Up The pandemic has forced people to change their lives dramatically, which has contributed to the crime rate dropping.</b> The bad news: an uptick in shootings and killings.<b>both violent and property crime rates incrased fairly steadily from the arly 1960 through the early 1990s but dropped considerably over the course of the 1990s -crime rose in 1960s,1970s, and 1980 but dropped in 1990s.</b>;<b>More than 20 major cities have reduced police budgets in some form, and activists are fighting to ensure that is only the start.</b><b> ""Crime is escalating to a level we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.""</b><b>The U.S. borders are guarded by a vast and well-funded national security agency that has grown far larger and more powerful in recent years.</b><b>A measure to provide more money for local police departments has become mired in a long-running debate among Democrats about the politics of crime, as Republicans step up attacks.</b><b>Rebecca Hamlin, who studies immigration politics as a professor with the University of Massachusetts Amherst and wrote a book on the labeling of migrants, told Newsweek that the political usage of the term ""open border"" does not reflect reality, saying the Biden administration\'s policies are relatively restrictive compared to past presidential administrations.</b><b>Under conditions of intense political polarization, we find some Americans gravitating toward more restrictive policies and others toward greater liberalization of immigration.</b> We are in a struggle for hearts and minds on the question of immigration, a key issue in U.S.politics today, the issue that has galvanized the 40 percent of Americans who support Trump and the Republican Party. What is so remarkable is that a short time ago this was a country where many took pride in our immigrant heritage, celebrated ethnic diversity and religious pluralism, and (quite problematically) claimed the mission of defending democracy and human rights around the world. While our country has a long history of racism and xenophobia, beginning with the conquest of the native peoples and the enslavement of black people, racist ideology was not for half a century part of legitimate political discourse.<b>Democrats tried to strike a delicate balance with this package: While it includes more grant money for police, it also contains bills that would invest in reform efforts activists favor such as community-based violence interventions and first responders who are trained specifically to address mental health crises .</b> By tackling both, they hope to show their commitment to law enforcement while also acknowledging progressive concerns about the need for alternatives and accountability.<b>We found that despite conventional wisdom to the contrary, Democrat-run cities employ far more police officers and spend far more money on policing per capita than Republican-run cities.</b> In fact, police forces in Dem cities are 75% larger than police forces in GOP cities. <b>And Democrats spend about 38% more per person on policing than Republicans do.</b> <b>On average, Democrat- and Republican-run cities all saw an increase in police funding in 2022, with Democrats actually increasing police budgets by slightly more.</b>;<b> Rising Violent Crime Is Likely To Present A Political Challenge For Democrats In 2022 Violent crime is on the rise in many urban areas across the country, giving Republicans what they believe is an opening in key swing districts that could decide control of Congress next year.</b>“I don’t think there’s any data that would allow us to draw a causal conclusion here,” said David Weisburd , executive director of the Center for Evidence Based Crime Policy at George Mason University. <b>“Somehow arguing that Democrats cause crime or something of that sort just doesn’t fit the history of crime prevention in the U.S.”.</b><b>The issue of public safety may be about to play its most significant role in our politics since the mid-1990s, the beginning of a decadeslong decline in crime that steadily eroded its political salience.</b><b>In recent weeks, a crime wave has been spreading across the country, especially in urban areas controlled by Democrats.</b> It is concentrated in retail establishments and includes sophisticated \xe2\x80\x9csmash and grab\xe2\x80\x9d attacks by seasoned criminals.<b>Years of research done by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett of the Equality Trust in the U.K. found that as inequality goes up, so does crime--particularly violent crime.</b>Homicide rates, an important indicator of violent crime, are lower in societies with strong democratic institutions\xc2\xa0and cultural values of nonviolence and equality. <b>Though data limitations make conclusions about causality difficult to reach, current research suggests that nations undergoing transitions from autocracy to democracy experience the highest homicide rates.</b> Meanwhile, strong democracies and strong autocracies tend to have the lowest homicide rates.We have been told over and over again how Democrats are soft on crime. <b>We have been told how Democratic cities and states have higher crime rates.</b> How murder is rampant in Democratic-controlled cities and states.The current narrative around crime and murder is convenient and wrong. Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re watching CNN or Fox News, or getting news online or from a traditional newspaper, you would think that the increase in murder is a phenomenon found mostly in liberal cities. <b>Many have tried attributing this increase to Democratic policies, specifically police reform.</b> Republican lawmakers and ad makers have contributed to this narrative through clever messaging and strategies.<b>Long seen as a political wedge for Republicans to use against Democrats, crime is increasingly a subject of concern within the Democratic Party and the big cities that make up much of its political base.</b><b>Criminals adapted to the new policy with a surge of nonviolent, quickly executed crimes.</b> Car theft in 2021, after the law changed, rose 50% . Catalytic converter theft was up an astonishing 10,000% over 2019 by mid-June. Smash-and-grab robberies, especially of pot shops and parking lots , soared.\xe2\x80\x9cDefund the police\xe2\x80\x9d was more than just a catchphrase for the radical left. <b>Democratic cities across the country reduced funding for their police forces over the past two years.</b> Minneapolis, which saw some of the year\xe2\x80\x99s most violent riots, cut its police budget by $8 million. Los Angeles slashed police funding by $150 million, and New York City shrank the NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s budget by $1 billion.<b>""Those on the Left know that their soft-on-crime policies have wreaked havoc in the cities where they have implemented those policies,"" the report says.</b> Pictured: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, speaks during a ceremonial groundbreaking at the Obama Presidential Center on Sept. 28, 2021, in Chicago. (Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images) \t\t\t . Violent crime in the United States shot up last year as the pandemic raged. <b>Major cities across the country saw a more than 30% jump in homicides as well as increases in aggravated assaults, according to a January report from the National Commission on Covid-19 and Criminal Justice.</b><b>In Democrat-dominated cities, violent crime rose far more than the national average.</b> Last year, murder rose 50 percent in Chicago, 44 percent in New York, and 38 percent in Los Angeles. The murder rate in Baltimore was higher than El Salvador\xe2\x80\x99s or Guatemala\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 nations from which citizens can claim asylum purely based on gang violence and murder.But crime is also politically potent, as Republicans grasp, and is thus fertile ground for attacks both fair and demagogic. (Just because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a simple, quick answer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t claim you do.) <b>In key races, Republicans have accused Democrats of being soft and ineffective on crime.</b> They\xe2\x80\x99ve attacked incumbents for presiding over rising violence and challengers for having supported cuts in police spending.<b>Democratic politicians singling out Republican states for their crime issues fail to adequately address the pertinent and increasing issue in their own cities, according to experts.</b><b>The surge in crime we’ve been witnessing in New York (murders up 14 percent over last year during the first three months of 2021) and Chicago (homicides up 33 percent) and Los Angeles (homicides up nearly 36 percent) is evidence that, while progressives may know how to get elected, they don’t have a clue about how to govern.</b><b> ""Crime is escalating to a level we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.""</b>;",0,11,22

The astronomically high tax rates of the time—the top rate of the income tax was an incredible 91%—was the reason, Dillon assured the president, that the nation could not shake the economic slows. <b>As soon as people started doing well, given such high progressive tax rates, their earnings hit the tax structure, and severe disincentives to work and invest kicked in.</b><b>Banks and mortgage lenders became increasingly predatory with their lending practices in the years leading up to the Great Recession.</b> Mortgages became easier to get, with fewer standards in place to ensure borrowers could repay them.

The allied forces took the city of Sevastopol, the home of the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s Black Sea Fleet, after a long siege, and by the war\xe2\x80\x99s end, the Crimea lay in ruins.The Ottoman Empire was the dominant force in the region for several hundred years, but the expansion of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s southern frontier, begun in earnest in the late 17th century by Peter I (the Great), frequently brought the two powers into conflict. Over the next two centuries, Russia and the Ottoman Empire engaged in a series of wars for control of the Black Sea region. One of those conflicts, fought from 1768 to 1774, concluded with the Treaty of K\xc3\xbc\xc3\xa7\xc3\xbck Kaynarca (1774), which ceded to Russia fortresses on the Kerch Peninsula and established an independent Crimean Tatar state. <b>In 1783 Catherine II (the Great) annexed the peninsula, and it became Russian territory.</b><b>The transfer of the Crimean oblast in the Soviet Union in 1954 was an administrative action of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet that transferred the government of Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR .</b><b>Crimea had been part of Russia for 200 years until 1954, when it was gifted to the Soviet Republic of the Ukraine by the then Russian Premier, Nikita Khrushchev.</b> <b>This was to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historic decision by Ukraine to unify with tsarist Russia.</b> <b>At that time, it would have been impossible to foresee that the Soviet Union would collapse and split into separate republics, that the borders would have to be renegotiated and that Ukraine would again be an independent country.</b>During the Russian Civil War , Crimea changed hands many times and was where Wrangel \'s anti-Bolshevik White Army made their last stand in 1920, with tens of thousands of those who remained being murdered as part of the Red Terror . <b>In 1921, the Crimean ASSR was created as an autonomous republic of the Russian SFSR .</b> <b>During World War II , Crimea was occupied by Germany until 1944.</b> <b>The ASSR was downgraded to an oblast within the Russian SFSR in 1945 following the deportation of the Crimean Tatars by the Soviet regime, and in 1954, Crimea was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR as part of celebrations of the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav , called the ""reunification of Ukraine with Russia"" in the USSR.</b><b> ""Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954.</b> <b>Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people.""</b>The Ukrainian revolution ousted a president who, while no doubt hopeless, nonetheless enjoyed a democratic mandate. <b>Until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Ukraine had been more of a region than a country and had been controlled by, or part of, other countries since the 12th century.</b> <b>Crimea, historically part of Russia, was only transferred to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev, as recently as 1954 .</b> Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol, which, for Russia, remains a strategically important warm water port.<b>Why did Khrushchev transfer Crimea to Ukraine in 1954?</b> Historians do not have any uniform opinion about that. This fact is mostly attributed to the well-known extravagance of the First Secretary of the CC of the CPSU (Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) or to his desire to atone for his guilt towards the Ukrainians because of the mass repressions in which Khrushchev was involved in the past. Meantime, we believe that the reply is to be found elsewhere \xe2\x80\x93 in the history of construction of the North Crimean Canal.<b>In March, it will be eight years since the day Crimea returned to the Russian Federation.</b> <b>This ended its 60-year history as part of Ukraine, which began, not on February 19, 1954, but a little earlier.</b> What does Ukraine have to do with it?.<b>In 1736-1737, the Russian army invaded Crimea and went through it.</b> But the Russians couldn’t maintain supply lines, because the Russian territories were too far away, separated from Crimea by the vast territory of the Wild Fields – roughly, the Pontic steppe of Ukraine, north of the Black Sea and the Azov Sea, as well as South and East Ukraine.<b>By a decree issued February 19, 1954 of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Crimea was transferred from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR.</b> This decree was passed amid solemn circumstances. There were many speeches, which as far as one could tell had one purpose: to explain to the peoples of the USSR the reasons which made this act essential. According to the speakers the chief reasons were these: 1) The Crimea\'s economy is closely linked with the economy of the Ukrainian Republic; 2) The Crimea forms, as it were, a natural extension of the southern Ukrainian steppes.;",0,33,15

Critics of Islam fail to appreciate how diverse and varied Islam can be. You can generalize about the beliefs and actions of all or most Muslims, just as you can about any religion, but there are many concepts and beliefs that only apply to some or just a few Muslims. <b>This is especially true when it comes to Muslim extremism, because Wahhabi Islam, the primary religious movement behind extremist Islam, includes beliefs and doctrines not found elsewhere.</b><b>Wahhabism derives its name from its founder\xc2\xa0Mohammed Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and is a strict form of Islam practised in Saudi Arabia.</b><b>Answer Wahhabism is an intolerant and aggressive form of Sunni Islam practiced primarily in Saudi Arabia, but also to a lesser extent in Qatar with some influence in the surround nations.</b> It seeks to purify Islam from any practices or innovations that do not come from the teachings of Muhammad. The term Wahhabi is from the name of the Muslim scholar Muhammad bin Abd al Wahhab, who lived from 1703 to 1791 and who advocated this radical approach. Zealous followers of Wahhab are sometimes referred to as Unitarians or Salafiyyun (from the word for \xe2\x80\x9cfollow\xe2\x80\x9d).<b>Founded in the 18th century by Muslims seeking a return to Koranic literalism, Wahhabism is one of the strictest sects of Islam.</b> The founder, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab, sought the protection of an emir, Muhammad ibn Saud, and the two joined forces to spread the doctrine throughout the Arabian Peninsula.

Ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines for these communities can help address the disparate health effects of the virus and achieve herd immunity. The Biden administration has identified vaccine equity as a priority, but states and local jurisdictions vary in how and the extent to which they prioritize equity. <b>Given that vaccine roll-out in the U.S. is inherently local, understanding how vaccination rates vary at the local level is important for informing outreach efforts and addressing equity.</b>At this early stage, two key factors have emerged as explanations for this implementation gap. <b>First, West Virginia was the only state in the country to opt out of the vaccine distribution partnership between the federal government and two national pharmacy chains\xe2\x80\x94CVS and Walmart\xe2\x80\x94for vaccinating residents at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.</b> Instead, the state relied on a network of

states are far behind the White House\'s goal of vaccinating people against COVID-19.</b> It\'s becoming a block-by-block, house-by-house effort to encourage people to get vaccinated.<b>According to data from Johns Hopkins University, vaccine hesitancy continues to be much more prevalent in conservative-leaning states, particularly in the South.</b><b>A new Health Testing Centers study about vaccination rates found that more than half of U.S. states have experienced a decline over the past decade.</b> <b>The research focused on vaccination rates reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for MMR, DTAP, Varicella, Hepatitis B and Polio among kindergarten kids in all states with the exception of Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina and Wyoming (these states did not report their data to the CDC).</b> <b>The study notes that vaccination rates among kindergartners have fluctuated considerably in recent years and that while annual

What might happen if he refuses to accept the results?<b>In the United States , a presidential transition is the process during which the president-elect of the United States prepares to take over the administration of the federal government of the United States from the incumbent president .</b> <b>Though planning for transition by a non-incumbent candidate can start at any time before a presidential election and in the days following, the transition formally starts when the General Services Administration (GSA) declares an \xe2\x80\x9capparent winner\xe2\x80\x9d of the election, thereby releasing the funds appropriated by Congress for the transition, and continues until inauguration day , when the president-elect takes the oath of office , at which point the powers , immunities, and responsibilities of the presidency are legally transferred to the new president.</b><b>In passing the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, Congress explained: \xe2\x80\x9cAny disruption occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States and its people.\xe2\x80\x9d To promote the orderly transfer of power, Congress established a framework for the federal government to prepare for a transition from one president to another.</b><b>“Six months before an election, the President must establish a White House Transition Coordinating Council, chaired by a senior employee of the Executive Office of the President” .</b><b> The law governing the transition of presidential power \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t require there to be an absolute winner.</b> It says the \xe2\x80\x98apparent\' winner.\xe2\x80\x9d .<b>The complicated, often contentious transition of power from president to president is steeped in complex laws and traditions.</b> <b>Since the first presidential transition in 1797, the United States has followed these laws and traditions that govern the peaceful transition of power, although at times, with some dispute.</b>;<b> The law governing the transition of presidential power \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t require there to be an absolute winner.</b> It says the \xe2\x80\x98apparent’ winner.\xe2\x80\x9d .<b> The law governing the transition of presidential power \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t require there to be an absolute winner.</b> It says the \xe2\x80\x98apparent\' winner.\xe2\x80\x9d .;A voter must file a challenge within five days of the secretary of state or governor announcing the election results.

The judge of the superior court has 10 days to arrange a hearing, and then must decide whether to confirm the results of the election or annul and set aside the results. <b>If a judge determines that a candidate other than the declared winner has in fact received the most votes, the judge will declare that candidate the winner.</b>You might also hear the term ""projected winner."" This means the vote count is not complete, but the polls are closed and there is enough information to make a strong prediction. <b>An ""apparent winner"" means the count is complete in a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s favor, but the final results may hinge on a recount.</b> A ""winner"" is clearly ahead and it is almost certain this candidate will win.\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the problems we\xe2\x80\x99re having now is the failure of the administration to recognize. <b>The law says that the General Services Administration has a person who recognizes who the winner is, and then they have access to all the data and information the government possesses to be prepared.</b> <b>It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require there to be an absolute winner.</b> It says the apparent winner,” said Biden.Sweepstakes are great marketing promotions that provide entrants into a game of chance. <b>The winning entrant receives a prize that is typically predetermined by the sponsor.</b> Sweepstakes are governed by different laws and regulations within the United States.

Some of this research involves taking deadly viruses and enhancing their ability to spread quickly through a population—research that took place over the objections of hundreds of scientists, who have warned for years of the program\'s potential to cause a pandemic.<b>The U.S. federal government should have stopped funding research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2015 when China reduced its cooperation with the French in building and operating the lab, according to the leader of an investigation into COVID-19\xe2\x80\x99s origins by the State Department under the Trump administration.</b><b> ""Why did the US (NIH) in 2017 give $3.7m to the Wuhan Lab in China?</b> <b>Such grants were prohibited in 2014.</b>Backing the measure is the White Coat Waste Project , an animal rights group that 2 years ago publicized NIH’s funding of WIV. Justin Goodman, the group’s senior vice president, says that “taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to fund … cruel, wasteful, and dangerous animal experiments in hostile countries … where there’s no real transparency and accountability.” (The proposed measure, however, does not specifically mention animal studies. )The ban’s potential impact isn’t clear. <b>WIV is largely funded by the Chinese government, and researchers there have received no U.S. funding since NIH, citing compliance issues, suspended a small subcontract for studying bat coronaviruses in July 2021.</b>;<b>Trump responded: ""The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million.</b> I\'ve been hearing about that. And we\'ve instructed that if any grants are going to that area we\'re looking at it, literally about an hour ago, also early in the morning, we will end that grant very quickly. But it was granted quite awhile ago.<b>NOTE: The federal government does not offer grants or “free money” to individuals to start a business or cover personal expenses.</b> For personal financial assistance, the government offers federal benefit programs . These programs help individuals and families become financially self-sufficient or lower their expenses . What you might see about grants online or in the media may not be true.<b> White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said Monday that he expects Obama will issue even more grants of commutations and pardons before leaving office.</b><b>Or suppose a past president wanted to give federal education grants to universities that refuse to follow the civil rights laws, in violation of Title VI.</b> That president could claim enforcement discretion to \xe2\x80\x9cnegotiate\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the civil rights laws, rather than cutting off funds entirely as Congress required. Under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 rule here, President Nixon would have had unreviewable discretion to do just that. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s orders granting discriminatory southern universities a reprieve were struck down by the courts in a case called Adams v. Richardson (1973).

The funding pause was lifted in response to today\xe2\x80\x99s release of the Department of Health and Human Services Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (HHS P3CO Framework).\xc2\xa0 The HHS P3CO Framework describes a multi-disciplinary review process, involving the funding agency and a Department-level review group, that considers the scientific merits and potential benefits of the research, as well as the potential to create, transfer, or use an enhanced potential pandemic pathogen.\xc2\xa0 This framework formalizes robust oversight for federally funded research with enhanced pathogens of pandemic potential.\xc2\xa0 It is the product of an extensive deliberative process undertaken by experts throughout the public and private sectors, and is aligned with the Recommended Policy Guidance for Departmental Development of Review Mechanisms for Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight (P3CO) .It’s unclear what other funding the president may be including in his figure. An April 16 Fox News story cited another $3.4 million grant , regarding a behavioral study, that may have included some funding that went to the Wuhan lab. But the grant, which was awarded to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, hasn’t been terminated. <b>It was originally for 2014-2019 and a second related grant was approved this year.</b><b>On Dec 19, 2017, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that they would resume funding gain-of-function experiments involving influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.</b> A moratorium had been in place since October, 2014. At the time, the NIH had stated that the moratorium \xe2\x80\x9cwill be effective until a robust and broad deliberative process is completed that results in the adoption of a new US Government gain-of-function research policy\xe2\x80\x9d. This process has now concluded.<b>The grant cancellation came at a time when then-President Donald Trump and others questioned the U.S. funding to a lab in Wuhan, while exaggerating the amount of federal money involved.</b>The US government has lifted its controversial ban on funding experiments that make certain pathogens more deadly or transmissible. <b>On 19 December, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that scientists can once again use federal money to conduct \xe2\x80\x98gain-of-function\xe2\x80\x99 research on pathogens such as influenza viruses.</b> But the agency also said that researchers\xe2\x80\x99 grant applications will undergo greater scrutiny than in the past.<b>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is dropping a controversial, 1-month-old plan to cap the amount of support an individual scientist can receive in order to spread funds to more investigators.</b> Instead, the agency will eventually devote $1 billion a year\xe2\x80\x94about 3% of its $34 billion budget\xe2\x80\x94specifically to funding proposals from early- and midcareer investigators.

A transcript of that conversation is below, condensed and edited for length and clarity.<b>Both of these theories could be true (not to mention a whole host of other explanations ), but it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that something bigger is at play here since the polls misfired in similar ways in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections: Pollsters may be systematically missing certain types of Republican support.</b>As with our first poll , we contacted the most active political pollsters in our database. 1 This time, 24 responded, on questions about ethics and about FiveThirtyEight\xe2\x80\x99s pollster ratings and Senate forecast . <b>Their answers reveal the thinking of two dozen people who conduct many of the polls that help inform horse-race coverage of major elections.</b> Their work is a primary factor driving our and others\xe2\x80\x99 models forecasting November\xe2\x80\x99s vote for Senate control.<b> \tTo be fair to pollsters, many Americans demand more certainty and precision from political polls than they do from other disciplines of social science.</b> Just a couple of percentage points can make all the difference in an election.While some challenges to polls are ever-present (e.g., respondents not answering carefully or giving socially desirable answers), the risk that bad actors could compromise a public opinion poll is, in some respects, a new one. It is a consequence of the field\xe2\x80\x99s migration toward online convenience samples of people who sign themselves up to get money or other rewards by taking surveys. This introduces the risk that some people will answer not with their own views but instead with answers they believe are likely to please the poll\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor. <b>It also raises the possibility that people who do not belong in a U.S. poll (e.g., people in another country) will try to misrepresent themselves to complete surveys and accrue money or other rewards.</b><b>This is not to suggest that the general quality of polling data is declining or that the problems facing pollsters have no answers.</b> <b>Still, consumers of polling data need to be more careful than ever.</b><b>The idea is that poll respondents score higher on social trust than the general population, and because of that, they’re not a representative sample of the population.</b> That could be skewing the results.<b>One way to test how much people actually believe something, al-Gharbi wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cis to look out for yawning gaps between rhetoric and behaviors.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact that roughly 2,500 people participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection suggests that the overwhelming majority of Republicans do not believe the election was stolen, no matter what they tell pollsters, in al-Gharbi\xe2\x80\x99s view.</b><b>\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing polls are unable to accurately measure is voter turnout,\xe2\x80\x9d Brady said.</b> \xe2\x80\x9cAnother key variable is voter turnout.

There are a lot of ways to try to do that.The memo released on Tuesday noted that low-propensity voters — those who are expected to turn out rarely — broke more for Republicans than for Democrats. <b>But the larger culprit, the pollsters said, was likely a failure to accurately capture the attitudes of certain voters.</b><b>That is making them more difficult for pollsters to reach because people will often not answer calls from unfamiliar numbers.</b>;<b>Gallup has been synonymous with polling for decades.</b> But the pollster that made its name forecasting a Franklin Roosevelt win over Alf Landon in 1936 has decided, at least for now, to stop polling the presidential horse race in favor of focusing on issues. It won\xe2\x80\x99t poll the 2016 primaries and may not poll the general election.A lot of people wonder about the accuracy of the polls, and it would be a big deal if the pollsters themselves were just as skeptical. <b>We decided to drill down on Deace\xe2\x80\x99s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data, and that Gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust its methodology.</b>;Sanders eked out a narrow victory. <b>Of the many reasons pollsters might have been off , this may be one of them: There\'s more to polling than the margin of error.</b>The failure of the last-minute polls in Britain to accurately call the general election of 2015 and again in the Brexit referendum in June 2016, provides some insights for the US presidential election. <b>The 2015 failure prompted the British Polling Council to set up an inquiry into what went wrong.</b> <b>Four possible explanations outlined in their preliminary report , published in January 2016, of what went wrong in Britain may be relevant to the US presidential election: a late swing, sampling problems, herding behaviour and mis- or \xe2\x80\x9cover-reporting\xe2\x80\x9d.</b><b>But there are tantalizing reasons to suspect these polling numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t a mirage\xe2\x80\x94that this time, history may take a year off.</b> One of the biggest boons that Republicans received in 2016 and 2020 was Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the ballot: Some voters, it seems, really do only turn out to vote for their guy, a fact that often boosts downstream Republicans.

Great Britain began to abandon its protective tariffs in the first half of the 19th century after it had achieved industrial preeminence in Europe. Britain\xe2\x80\x99s spurning of protectionism in favour of free trade was symbolized by its repeal in 1846 of the Corn Laws and other duties on imported grain. One of the most famous tariffs is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 . Initially intended to protect American farmers from the post- World War II influx of European agricultural imports, the bill eventually approved by Congress added high tariffs on many other imports. When European countries retaliated, the resulting trade war restricted global trade, harming the economies of all countries involved. <b>In the United States, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was considered an overly-protectionist measure that worsened the severity of the Great Depression .</b><b>One thing you hear all the time is that protectionism caused the Great Depression.</b> I’ve always seen this as an attempt at a Noble Lie; there’s no good reason to believe that it’s true, but it has been used to scare governments into maintaining relatively free trade.<b> The Great Depression was marked by a severe outbreak of protectionist trade policies.</b> But contrary to the presumption that all countries scrambled to raise trade barriers, there was substantial cross-country variation in the movement to protectionism. Specifically, countries that remained on the gold standard resorted to tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls to a greater extent than countries that went off gold. Gold standard countries chose to maintain their fixed exchange rate and reduce spending on imports rather than allow their currency to depreciate.<b>The Great Depression was a breeding ground for protectionism.</b> Output fell, prices declined, and unemployment rose, pressuring governments to do something to revive their economies, even if that meant limiting imports. <b>But contrary to popular perception, some countries went much further down this protectionist road than others, according to The Slide to Protectionism in the Great Depression: Who Succumbed and Why?</b><b>\xe2\x80\x9cThe general contraction of trade led by trade barriers did harm the world economy and probably made the Great Depression worse,\xe2\x80\x9d Irwin said.</b><b>Home > Journals > The Journal of Economic History > Volume 70 Issue 4 > The Slide to Protectionism in the Great Depression:...</b><b>The canard circulates that trade protectionism, in the form of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, caused or helped to cause the Great Depression.</b> This myth does not survive even cursory examination of the actual evidence.Because of these unspeakable traumas, the Great Depression and its causes have remained at the forefront of economic study and debate.

Ben Sasse (R-NE), quoted by the Washington Post , on President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs.;<b> While both total protectionism and free trade have been tried in the past, the results were usually harmful.</b> As a result, multilateral \xe2\x80\x9c free trade agreements ,\xe2\x80\x9d or FTAs, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the 160-nation World Trade Organization (WTO) have become common. In FTAs, the participating nations mutually agree on limited protectionist practices tariffs and quotas. Today, economists agree that FTAs has averted many potentially disastrous trade wars.Protectionism occurs when countries place restrictions on imports into the economy. This can involve higher tariffs (a type of tax on imports) or quotas and embargoes. Other forms of protectionism can be less obvious, such as domestic subsidies to give industries unfair advantages. <b>The main effect of protectionism is a decline in trade, higher prices for some goods, and a form of subsidy for protected industries.</b><b>can you please explain from the economic point of view, why protectionism is bad?</b> If sometimes it is sensible to protect some industries to avoid unemployment, loses of some professionals, death of the industry and decreasing independence?Which is better protectionism or free trade?

The agreement also recognized the need of LDCs to improve their economies and reduce poverty , which made immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions difficult.

What is striking about these books \xe2\x80\x94 all quite recently written and published \xe2\x80\x94 is the anachronism of their geographic premise. <b>With millions of Muslims now living in North America and Western Europe, the old dichotomy of Islam and the West exists no more.</b> This presence of Muslims in the West has profound significance for both civilizations involved, Western and Islamic, and it has a potential for both good and ill.<b>Some two hundred million Muslims live in India, making up the predominantly Hindu country\xe2\x80\x99s largest minority group.</b> <b>For decades, Muslim communities have faced discrimination in employment and education and encountered barriers to achieving wealth and political power.</b> They are disproportionately the victims of communal violence. <b>Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling party have moved to limit Muslims\xe2\x80\x99 rights, particularly through the Citizenship Amendment Act, which allows fast-tracked citizenship for non-Muslim migrants from nearby countries.</b><b> Feeling condemned for crimes they didn\xe2\x80\x99t commit, some Muslims changed their names and clothing to conceal their identities, while others clung even tighter to their faith.</b> A few became outspoken advocates for the community.<b>It is important to understand that, just because migrants do not flee persecution, they are still entitled to have all their human rights protected and respected, regardless of the status they have in the country they moved to.</b> <b>Governments must protect all migrants from racist and xenophobic violence, exploitation and forced labour .</b> Migrants should never be detained or forced to return to their countries without a legitimate reason.<b>Now there will be an exception for members of six religious minority communities - Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian - if they can prove that they are from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh.</b> They will only have to live or work in India for six years to be eligible for citizenship by naturalisation, the process by which a non-citizen acquires the citizenship or nationality of that country.IMPACT : The Naturalization Era (1790\xe2\x80\x931952) was a defining period for immigration and conceptualizations of citizenship in the United States. <b>During this era, Muslim immigration and naturalization were limited by laws that barred or severely restricted immigration from Muslim-majority areas of the world and court rulings that reserved naturalization rights for white individuals.</b> <b>In the midst of the civil rights movement, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 opened the doors to increased immigration from Muslim-majority countries.</b> In April 2021, the US House of Representatives passed a bill titled the NO BAN Act, which would limit the ability of any US president to impose a travel ban on the basis of religion.\xc2\xa0 .<b>Almost six years later, a study shows that there are a great deal more Muslims in Germany than in 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 and that the population has become less homogenous.</b><b>While migration is a positive and empowering experience for many, it is increasingly clear that a lack of human rights-based human rights-based migration governance at the global and national levels is leading to the routine violation of migrants\xe2\x80\x99 rights in transit, at international borders , and in the countries they migrate to.</b><b> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome 25 million Muslims live in the 28 Member States of the European Union.</b> The vast majority of these Muslims came seeking work and they were needed as they worked in sectors usually referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult, dirty and dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d. <b>In the 80\xe2\x80\x99s, they started to be perceived not as Immigrants from Morocco, Pakistan or Turkey but as \xe2\x80\x9cMuslims\xe2\x80\x9d, eventually threatening the social fabric of European societies.</b> The terrorist attacks by tiny groups of Islamist fanatics and the radicalisation of \xe2\x80\x9cthousands\xe2\x80\x9d of native Muslim Europeans added fuel to the surging anti-Muslim sentiment in Europe.<b>On Saturday, 8 September 2018, the Worldwide Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, the Fifth Khalifah (Caliph), His Holiness, Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad (aba) delivered a landmark address about the world\xe2\x80\x99s immigration crisis and the subsequent rise of the far-right in the Western world before an audience of more than 1,000 dignitaries and guests.</b> This was on the second day of the 43 rd Annual Convention (Jalsa Salana) of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Germany. The full transcript of the address by His Holiness on this occasion is presented below.<b>Since 2015, hundreds of thousands of Muslim economic migrants, claiming to be asylum seekers, have continued to flood each year into Germany.</b> The results have not been good.

The closest analogy to what we experienced in the U.S. in 2020 is the 1918-19 influenza pandemic , which also broke out during an election year and killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.Countries have taken many precautions to guarantee safe in-person voting, including requiring masks and staggering voting hours. Some have successfully expanded voting by mail. <b>Challenges remain in holding elections during a pandemic, including lack of funding, technical glitches, low turnout, and legitimacy concerns.</b> In the United States, voting rules and practices vary widely.<b>Historically the consequences of pandemics are complex and difficult to predict.</b> Some diseases like H1N1 disappeared from the public consciousness when they subsided. But many diseases never go away and their social and political impacts persist.<b>But in the 2020 that’s actually happening, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything–from how the campaign is conducted to how we vote to what we value.</b> It has canceled conventions, relegated fundraising and campaigning to the digital realm, and forced many states to rapidly change how people get and submit their ballots, with unpredictable and potentially disastrous results. The acute crises have refocused the nation’s attention, bringing issues like public health and economic and racial inequality to the fore and prompting the public to revisit what characteristics it wants in its leaders.Many political scientists believe that an increase in information leads to electoral participation (Carpini et al., 1996). However, those who lack sufficient information tend to align with \xe2\x80\x9copinion leaders\xe2\x80\x9d by following perceptions of knowledge or partisanship (Katz et al., 1966). Other factors, such as directionally motivated reasoning (Flynn et al., 2017), selective exposure (Guess et al., 2018), and correction-induced misperceptions (Nyhan et al., 2010), may also play a role in individual perception. <b>With the COVID-19 pandemic characterized by uncertainty about the disease and best welfare practices, the public is vulnerable to partisan-driven misinformation at the intersection of public health and politics.</b>As public health experts continue to issue widespread reminders to American citizens about the need for social distancing, about two-thirds of U.S. adults (66%) report that they now no longer feel comfortable entering a polling place.

Most COVID-19 deaths occur in people older than 65. .<b>Still, you might wonder about the benefits and risks of childhood vaccines.</b> <b>Here are answers to some common questions about childhood vaccines.</b>What we are just recently learning is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more happening when a vaccine is given. It started with epidemiological observations at the population level, that is, by studying the effect of vaccines on overall health, and discovering that something is missing in this equation. <b>We get effects on overall mortality that we cannot at all explain based on just the specific protective effect of the vaccine against the disease.</b>But as with many scientific studies that have sociological components, it is hard to separate causation and correlation. <b>For instance, it may be that those who are regularly vaccinated are healthier and more aware of their health in general, and thus less likely to contract COVID-19 as a result.</b> If the two facts are causally linked, it may well be that\xc2\xa0those other vaccinations actually are slightly protecting the populace against COVID-19, perhaps through some immune mechanism.People considering a COVID-19 vaccine may worry about complications and side effects. <b>Yet for almost all individuals, the known risks of getting COVID-19 far outweigh any potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccine.</b>For example, campylobacter, an intestinal bacterial\xc2\xa0infection, can cause GBS, a disease of the peripheral nervous system. Influenza virus can exacerbate symptoms of multiple sclerosis, a disease of the central nervous system. And Coxsackie virus can cause diabetes, a disease that occurs when the body reacts against cells in the pancreas that make insulin. <b>Because natural infections can lead to autoimmune conditions, people can reasonably wonder whether vaccines can also cause autoimmunity as well.\xc2\xa0 .</b>FACT: Evidence continues to indicate that getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the best protection against getting COVID-19, whether you have already had COVID-19 or not. <b>study published in August 2021 Getting vaccinated provides greater protection to others since the vaccine helps reduce the spread of COVID-19.</b>Vaccine uptake is considered as one of the most effective methods of defending against COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).

Additionally, progress in closing gender and racial wage gaps throughout this period has been either nonexistent (for racial gaps) or disappointingly slow (for gender gaps).The authors hear a lot from executives that they are currently having to stomach massive pay increases for lower-level workers. But the data doesn’t support that. <b>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks wages and salaries for production and non-supervisory workers.</b> <b>The inflation-adjusted wages of these production workers has increased by a little under 9% since 1970, while the equivalent increase for all employees in the private sector has been 76%.</b><b>For years it was the central question in an otherwise impressive recovery by the American job market: Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t wages rising faster?.</b><b> Increasing the federal minimum wage is once again in play, with Biden and key congressional Democrats pushing to raise it in stages to the $15 target by 2025.</b> The House is expected to pass legislation containing the hike next week, but the effort could be derailed in the Senate with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema expressing opposition to the move.<b>Since the early 1970s, hourly inflation-adjusted wages received by the typical worker have barely risen, growing only 0.2% per year.</b> Assigning relative responsibility to the policies and economic forces that underlie rising inequality or declining labor share is a challenge. <b>International trade and technological progress have played significant roles, putting downward pressure on the wages of low-skilled workers.</b> <b>We also know that educated workers have fared better; the wages received by those who finished their education with a four-year college degree grew from 134% of high school graduates’ wages to 168%.</b><b>To hear politicians tell it, wages are rising at the fastest rate in a decade, are the same as they were 45 years ago and are at a 60-year low.</b> And all three claims could be correct, depending on what measure is used to justify it.<b>On the other hand, Americans are deeply indebted, many are stuck with part-time jobs , and wage gains have been so disappointing, their weakness has challenged fundamental premises of mainstream economics : Simply put, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be able to pay workers this little when the unemployment rate is this low.</b><b>A widespread misconception about the market economy is that it was responsible for low wage rates from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution through the early twentieth century.</b> One answer to that claim, as all respectable economic historians now concede, is that the Industrial Revolution introduced the era of rising living standards for the great mass of the population.How prevalent is this situation and how much is the shortfall? <b>We find that a majority of employed workers’ real (inflation-adjusted) wages have failed to keep up with inflation in the past year.</b> <b>For these workers, the median decline in real wages is a little more than 8.5 percent.</b> Taken together, these outcomes appear to be the most severe faced by employed workers over the past 25 years.As the cost of everything from fuel to food increases, the value of the dollar decreases.

As a result, the majority of Russian exports consisted of energy products as well as high-tech military equipment.Much of Putin\xe2\x80\x99s authority at home rests on his ability to deliver steadily improving living standards as the upside of his authoritarian rule. But Russians of all income classes are tightening their belts. <b>The sanctions have already cost the Russian economy 9 percent of GDP, according to the IMF.</b> <b>Since Russia\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of Crimea in February 2014, the ruble has lost 50 percent of its value.</b><b> The readiness of China and India to snap up cheap Russian oil has helped, but Nechaev and other analysts say Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy has started to decline and is likely facing a prolonged period of stagnation as a consequence of Western sanctions.</b><b>Nine months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Russian economy is doing better than expected.</b> <b>The predicted collapse has been avoided, and the forecasted 8–10 percent fall in GDP for the year has been reduced to a 3–4 percent drop.</b> Following World War II, the Soviet Union emerged as a global superpower to rival the United States. <b>But after the Soviet Union crumbled in the early 1990s, Russia had to reinvent its economy.</b> Markets Insider compiled 13 surprising facts about Russia\'s economy.

How the government reacted to these developments, and how the Russian economy has changed in response, has been a fascinating history to watch unfold.;<b> The ruble lost about 25% of its value to trade at 104 to the dollar at 12:15 p.m.</b> ET after earlier plummeting as much as 40%. The start of trading on the Russian stock market was delayed, and then canceled entirely, according to a statement from the country\xe2\x80\x99s central bank.<b>Many of the sanctions were aimed at inhibiting parts of the Russian economy\'s ability to do business.</b> Russia\'s economy is less reliant on imports than most other large, advanced economies and emerging markets, the report notes, but some sectors are highly exposed, especially the manufacturing of transportation equipment, chemicals, food products and IT services. Sanctions did a good job initially of restricting Russian access to key imports , such as parts for manufacturing. Still, despite the initial shock, Russia pivoted quickly, and began importing more goods from nations like China, Belarus and Turkey, which are not participating in the sanctions regime.Building foreign reserves could have been a way for the Kremlin to guard Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy against sanctions, by giving the central bank more ammunition to protect the value of the ruble. <b>The ruble lost half its value against the U.S. dollar after Russia annexed Crimea, forcing Russia\xe2\x80\x99s central bank to spend $130 billion to stabilize the currency.</b>There are a whole bunch of other rationales and dilemmas going into the Russia sanctions \xe2\x80\xa6 the threat of nuclear escalation, the issue of global economic stability. Russia is a massive commodity exporter. <b>The sanctions are already having large effects on markets and on commodity prices .</b> Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the efficacy concerns.<b>The ruble fell about 30% against the dollar Monday — making it worth less than 1 U.S. cent — after the U.S., European Union and United Kingdom announced moves to block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system and to restrict Russia\'s use of its massive foreign currency reserves.</b> The system is used to move billions of dollars around more than 11,000 banks and other financial institutions around the world.<b>The strength of the Russian ruble following heavy-handed sanctions by the U.S. and other European nations shows that there is a high level of opposition to the USD hegemony, and the BRICS nations see this as an opportune time to capitalize on the growing level of dissatisfaction towards the U.S.</b><b> Published by , Mar 27, 2023 Read more Estimated change in gross domestic product (GDP) due to potential Western sanctions in Russia in 2022, by target sector* .</b>dollar exchange rate was stable through 2020 and 2021 apart from a depreciation at the height of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020. <b>However, within two weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, the ruble depreciated sharply from 80 rubles/dollar to 120 rubles/dollar.</b>As the West moved to cut off Russia\xe2\x80\x99s access to its foreign reserves, limit imports of key technologies and take other restrictive actions, the Kremlin launched some drastic measures to protect the economy. <b>Those included hiking interest rates to as high as 20%, instituting capital controls and forcing Russian business to convert their profits into rubles.</b><b>The measures announced by the U.S. and its allies over the weekend include targeting the ability of Russia\'s central bank to support the country\'s currency, the ruble, which fell about 30% against the U.S. dollar on Monday to less than 1 cent.</b> It regained some ground after Russia\'s central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% to shore up the currency.<b>The economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies have sent Russians scrambling to spend their rubles while withdrawing dollars, euros and\xc2\xa0other currencies\xc2\xa0from banks as the value of their local cash plunged.</b>Russia\xe2\x80\x99s financial sector has been slammed by war and sanctions.

These sanctions were driven by Executive Orders (E.O.) 13660, 13661, 13662, and 13685 issued by the President of the US between March 2014 and December 2014.<b>In recent days [and weeks], the United States and its key partners and global allies have imposed unprecedented economic pressure on Russia and Belarus.\xc2\xa0 As a result, sanctions evasion may occur through various means, including through currently unsanctioned Russian and Belarusian banks or other financial institutions that retain at least some access to the international financial system.</b><b>Even as Russia marks a historic default on its debt , the nation\'s currency is gaining strength.</b> The ruble hit a new high against the dollar this week, continuing its streak as the best-performing currency in the world this year.<b>The military invasion of Ukraine by Russia has given rise to a continuous swath of far-reaching sanctions on Russia and Russian entities by Canada, the US, the EU, and other countries that touch on the global reach of Canadian business, including transactional, financial, and contractual matters for oil and gas companies, mining companies, commodity producers, technology and goods producers, service suppliers, financial institutions, shipowners, charterers, insurers, ports and cargo owners, among other parties collaterally impacted by the sweeping multijurisdictional sanctions.</b>;",0,2,8

Yet prisons and jails are notorious for making communication difficult or impossible. <b>People are incarcerated far from home and visitation access is limited, phone calls are expensive and sometimes taken away as punishment, mail is censored and delayed, and video calls and emerging technologies are all too often used as an expensive (and inferior) replacement for in-person visits.</b><b>The prison calling system in the US is a web of complicated policies.</b> Each state makes its own rules which accounts for most of the confusion. What may be applicable in Florida might be frowned upon in Washington. Yet there are also regulations that hold true for the whole country.A surging inmate population in the 1980s led to a boom in for-profit prisons. <b>Today, privately run prisons have become the government\xe2\x80\x99s default detention centers for undocumented migrants.</b>Overall, 28% of U.S. adults say people convicted of crimes spend too much time in prison, while 32% say they spend too little time and 37% say they spend about the right amount of time, according to a Pew Research Center survey of 10,221 adults conducted in July 2021. The question was asked as part of a broader survey examining differences in Americans\xe2\x80\x99 political attitudes and values across a range of topics. <b>The survey asked about prison time in a general way and did not address penalties for specific crime types.</b><b>Communication with the outside world is crucial for people in jail.</b> <b>This includes individuals facing deportation while detained in immigration detention centers, who do not have the right to court-appointed counsel.</b><b>A(n) _____ is a process of prison and jail administration in which correctional officers are in continuous visual contact with inmates during the day.</b> a. operant conditioning approach b. rehabilitation approach c. direct supervision approach d. participatory approach.Nearly 200 people responded to a Marshall Project callout sharing the routes they travel to visit incarcerated family members. <b>In interviews, many of them said they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the time, money, childcare or car to make the journey to these facilities as often as they would like.</b> Others said they could not afford to visit at all.That\xe2\x80\x99s why programs that help inmates re-enter society are critical. From state to state, re-entry programs vary. Not all states have them. <b>And different branches of the criminal justice system have different ways of addressing re-entry, frequently leaving former inmates with few lifelines to help the rehabilitation process.</b><b>Prisoners must be allowed reasonable access to an attorney, but otherwise, phone rules are largely up to the discretion of the individual prisons or states.</b><b>Federal Bureau of Prisons inmates cannot pick up the telephone to call their friends or loved ones whenever they want.</b> <b>Similarly, inbound calls and cell phones are not permitted in federal prisons.</b> There is a monitored\xc2\xa0prison phone\xc2\xa0system available for inmate use, however, which allows inmates limited outbound telephone privileges from their housing units. <b>Using this system, inmates may make outgoing calls to contacts on a pre-approved list of contacts.</b><b>Although correctional officials claim that they can be used for fraud and extortion, just as state provided phones are, the fact remains that most prisoners understand that these phones are too valuable as family communication tools to be put at risk by committing other crimes.</b><b>More information about incarcerated people\xe2\x80\x99s right to communicate with the outside world can be found in The Jailhouse Lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 Manual .</b><b>Freedom for Immigrants maintains the most up-to-date map of the U.S. immigration detention system.</b> <b>The map tracks the more than 200 immigrant prisons and jails in the U.S. as well as the Freedom for Immigrants National Visitation Network .</b>;",0,2,7

John Kennedy (D) in Chicago. <b>Nixon was the first American presidential candidate to lose an election despite carrying a majority of the states.</b><b>The widespread rejection of the election result among Republicans reflects a new and dangerous dynamic in American politics: the normalization of false and increasingly extreme conspiracy theories among tens of millions of mainstream voters, according to government scholars, analysts and some lawmakers on both sides of the political divide.</b> The trend has deeply troubling long-term implications for American political and civic institutions, said Paul Light, a veteran political scientist at New York University (NYU).;<b>More women than ever before have won major party primaries for governor, U.S. Senate and House this year \xe2\x80\x94 paving the way for November battles that could significantly increase the number of women in elected office and change the public debate on issues such as health care, immigration, abortion rights, education and gun control.</b> Some of these candidates could also play a pivotal role in whether Democrats are able to take control of the U.S. House.<b>In a historic victory for female candidates, at least 117 women won elections across the country Tuesday night, taking over high-level political positions including House seats, Senate seats, and governorships.</b> <b>Next year, a record number of women candidates, most of them Democrats, will be in Congress.</b><b>A record number of Black women have won election to Congress this year, building upon the historic strides seen during the midterm election two years ago.</b><b> Among gubernatorial races 9 women were elected.</b> Forty-five women of color were elected this November: Forty-three to the House, Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hi) and Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM). Senator Tammy Duckworth\'s (D-IL) seat was not up for reelection, bringing the total women of color in Congress to at least 45.<b> A Record Number Of Women Will Serve In Congress (With Potentially More To Come) A record-breaking year of female candidates and nominees will culminate in a record-breaking number of female legislators on Capitol Hill next year.</b><b>You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably already heard that more women are running for Congress in 2020 than in any other election cycle \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s saying a lot, given the record-breaking number of female candidates in the 2018 midterms.</b> However, that cycle had an indisputable blue tinge , whereas this year, the share of female candidates who are Republican also shot up, thanks in part to a growing list of organizations committed to recruiting and supporting Republican women\xe2\x80\x99s candidacies.<b>By press time, at least 92 had won in the House and 10 had won in the Senate (joining 10 already in the upper chamber) for a total of 112 women \xe2\x80\x94 the most women to serve in Congress at once in history.</b> (The previous record was 107.)<b>In the last midterm elections, Democratic women won a historic number of congressional races.</b> <b>Two years later, the GOP had its own \xe2\x80\x9c Year of the Woman .\xe2\x80\x9d But now that the 2022 primaries are long over, we can say that any signs that Republican women would continue to gain on their Democratic counterparts were likely a flash in the pan, not a watershed.</b><b>But the nationwide ballot also saw Kamala Harris set to become the first woman vice-president and a record number of women voted into Congress - the part of the US government that writes and passes laws.</b>Her victory highlights a dominant theme of this year’s primary season. <b>After running for office in record numbers, women are now winning Democratic nominations at a record rate.</b> <b>In Democratic primaries that have featured at least one woman and one man but no incumbent, women have won the most votes 71% of the time, according to Dave Wasserman, an analyst for the Cook Political Report, a Washington-based newsletter.</b> <b>The situation is different on the Republican side, where women have won 35% of those scenarios.</b><b>There will be more women of color sworn in to the 117th U.S. Congress than ever before, with at least 51 women of color elected.</b> Ballots are still being tallied in two close races, so the number could climb.<b> More Republican women than ever before are winning primaries for US House, which has traditionally been the biggest obstacle to getting women elected to a GOP conference that\xe2\x80\x99s still overwhelmingly male and white.</b>;",0,17,17

Also, a movement to improve the basic education of the population has emerged, with a growing belief that all people have the right to an education.T he yields from investing in girls\xe2\x80\x99 education are substantial. <b>An educated girl is likely to increase her personal earning potential, as well as reduce poverty in her community.</b> <b>According to the World Bank, the return on one year of secondary education for a girl correlates with as high as a 25% increase in wages later in life.</b> The effects carry from one generation to the next: educated girls have fewer, healthier and better educated children.Benefits of economic empowerment Women’s economic empowerment is central to realizing women’s rights and gender equality. <b>Empowering women in the economy and closing gender gaps in the world of work are key to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 1 When more women work, economies grow.</b> <b>2 3 4 Increasing women’s and girls’ educational attainment contributes to women’s economic empowerment and more inclusive economic growth.</b> 5 6 Women’s economic equality is good for business.<b>I am delighted to be here today and to have the opportunity to share my thoughts on a very important topic: how India can accelerate its growth through encouraging greater economic participation by women.</b><b>Both advanced and developing countries stand to gain if women participate in the labor force at the same rate as men, work the same number of hours as men, and are employed at the same levels as men across sectors.</b> <b>Even without full parity, countries can grow the global gross domestic product (GDP) by $12 trillion by matching the rate of progress toward parity of their region\'s fastest-improving country.</b> See the methodology for more on the factors that influence how much a country gains.<b>Ensuring that all girls and young women receive a quality education is their human right, a global development priority, and a strategic priority for the World Bank.</b><b>Look no further than the declining fertility rate, or the number of live births a woman is expected to have over her lifetime.</b> It tracks closely with birth rates and since 1950, the worldwide fertility rate has dropped from an average of 4.7 children to 2.4 children. \xc2\xa0 The value of human capital \xe2\x80\x93 the share of human capital in total wealth \xe2\x80\x93 is 62 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s four times the value of produced capital and 15 times the value of natural capital.\xc2\xa0 Globally, we \xe2\x80\x93 governments, private sector, families, individuals \xe2\x80\x93 spend more than $5.6 trillion a year on education and training. <b>Countries spend 5 percent of GDP on education or 20 percent of their national budget.\xc2\xa0 Education employs about five percent of the labor force.</b> Moreover, private returns to schooling \xe2\x80\x93 what individuals receive in the labor market \xe2\x80\x93 have been increasing.\xc2\xa0 Returns are increasing by more than 20 percent in Africa and more than 14 percent in East Asia and the Pacific.\xc2\xa0 The big change recently has been that the returns to tertiary education are now highest. Skills demanded by the labor market are changing One of the reasons for the change in the returns pattern is the race between technology and education, as labor markets adjust to automation.\xc2\xa0 In this new world, the ability of workers to compete is handicapped by the poor performance of education systems in most developing countries.\xc2\xa0 Technological change and global competition demand the mastery of competencies and the acquisition of new skills for many.<b>From Canada, Japan, Norway to Australia, young women on average earn almost 15 percent less than men, even though they are more educated, said the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</b>Put simply, globalization is the connection of different parts of the world.

Globalization is most often used in an economic context, but it also affects and is affected by politics and culture. <b>In general, globalization has been shown to increase the standard of living in developing countries, but some analysts warn that globalization can have a negative effect on local or emerging economies and individual workers.</b>Educating girls across the world is a mission we really care about at Kaplan. We believe that studying just for the love of learning is worthwhile. However, the effect it can have on not only the life of the individual, but also society as a whole, is truly amazing. <b>Here, you can read how providing a better education for girls can transform entire economies, and has helped shape the modern world.</b><b>Giving women greater economic empowerment means enabling women to increase their right to economic resources and their control over meaningful decisions that benefit themselves, their households and their communities.</b> These include the right to control their own time, their income and access to participation in existing markets equally.

Noting that the \xe2\x80\x9cscreening of approved drugs to identify therapeutics for drug repurposing is a valid approach,\xe2\x80\x9d the NIAID researchers singled out CQ and one other drug in their closing paragraph as having noteworthy potential to \xe2\x80\x9creconfigure\xe2\x80\x9d the two coronavirus illnesses \xe2\x80\x9cinto a less virulent subclinical infection\xe2\x80\x9d resulting in less adverse disease outcomes.<b>Randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</b> Yet social media posts are claiming the drug works, and conservative outlets have touted an unpublished, and much-criticized, observational study as evidence of the drug’s effectiveness.<b> \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the one (hydroxychloroquine) survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape.</b><b>Compared to a placebo, hydroxychloroquine, a common prescription medication to treat malaria and rheumatic conditions, neither causes harm nor provides any clinical benefit to hospitalized adults with COVID-19.</b>;<b>The duration of intense grieving varied among those who took the survey, depending on what people had lost.</b> Nearly half of all people (48%) said their most powerful feelings subsided within the first 6 months, and two-thirds (67%) had recovered within 1 year. Pet owners were the most likely to recover quickly. Sixty-six percent of those who lost a pet said their intense grief lasted less than 6 months, compared to 48% of people who lost a close family member or friend to death and 45% who mourned the loss of a friendship/relationship.A 2002 poll conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago , as part of its General Social Survey, revealed similar results. <b>Seventy-two percent of those polled said they believed that there is a life after death, 17 percent did not, and 11 percent were undecided.</b> Clearly, the proportion of the U.S. population believing in an afterlife appears to have remained relatively consistent over three decades.This paper reports the impact of a major life event\xe2\x80\x93death\xe2\x80\x93on the physical, psychological and social well-being of the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s close friends. <b>We utilised data from a large longitudinal survey covering a period of 14 years (2002\xe2\x80\x932015) consisting a cohort of 26,515 individuals in Australia, of whom 9,586 had experienced the death of at least one close friend.</b> This longitudinal cohort dataset comprises responses to the SF-36 (health related quality of life measure) and allowed for analysis of the short and longer-term impacts of bereavement. In order to manage the heterogeneity of the socio-demographics of respondents who did/not experience a death event, we use a new and robust approach known as the Entropy Balancing method to construct a set of weights applied to the bereaved group and the control group (the group that did not experience death).Descriptive characteristics of the longitudinal cohort and repeat cross-sectional sample can be found in Table 7 . <b>At baseline, our sample contained more women than men and participants were aged 49–50 years on average.</b> Approximately half of the sample were working, half owned a home and half owned a car, with slightly higher proportions of home and car ownership in the longitudinal cohort.The NLMS is a large study of the effects of occupation, industry, income, education, and other socioeconomic factors on mortality. <b>Records from several Current Population Surveys of the Bureau of the Census (1979-1981) have been matched to the National Death Index to link individual social and economic data with mortality outcomes.</b> While the focus of this is on mortality, rather than quality or care of dying, the published reports do enhance our understanding of the role of social and economic variables on the age at death (Backlund et al., 1999; Johnson et al., 2000; Kaufman and Kaufman, 2001). This effort also highlights the value of linking the National Death Index with large ongoing national data collection efforts.In a survey study of more than 3,000 adults, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers compared psychedelic experiences with near-death experiences that were not drug related and found notable similarities in people\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes toward death. <b>Survey participants in both groups reported having less fear of death and dying after the experience.</b> They also reported that the experience had a lasting positive effect, providing personal meaning, spiritual significance and psychological insight.Classifying age groups by generation is most appropriate for social media surveys. For example,\xc2\xa0Gen-Zers and millennials are more likely to be social media savvy than the baby boomers or the silent generation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2. <b>By a Closed Age Group .</b>;<b>WHO does not recommend hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19.</b> <b>This recommendation is based on findings from 6 trials, with more than 6000 participants, who did not have COVID-19 and received hydroxychloroquine.</b> <b>Using hydroxychloroquine for prevention had little or no effect on preventing illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19.</b> <b>Taking hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 may increase the risk of diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, drowsiness and headache.</b><b>For most of us, the whole controversy over the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients seemed mostly political in nature and less so about the drug’s effectiveness.</b> Once Donald Trump came out in support of it, the gloves came off. At least half of the country decided that HCQ was not a scientific treatment for the coronavirus because the bad Orange Man was an anti-science president. Never mind that it was Trump who expedited the vaccine process to historic speed with Operation Warp Speed.<b>Multiple studies provide data that hydroxychloroquine (brand name: Plaquenil) does not provide a medical benefit for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.</b> <b>Hydroxychloroquine, an FDA-approved prescription drug used for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus, has been suggested as a possible treatment or preventive for COVID-19 based on demonstrated antiviral or immune system activity.</b><b>Randomized controlled trials — the highest standard of evidence — have found that hydroxychloroquine isn’t beneficial in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</b> Yet social media posts are claiming the drug works, and conservative outlets have touted an unpublished, and much-criticized, observational study as evidence of the drug’s effectiveness.;",0,0,12

There is a tendency among people who study this history to fixate on two canonical dates: 1979 and 1953. The former being the Iran hostage crisis, when radicalized students stormed the U.S. embassy and took American diplomatic personnel hostage for over a year, and the latter being the year in which the CIA-backed coup against the popular and constitutionally elected Prime Minister Mossadegh.<b> The US signs a \xc2\xa0 civil nuclear cooperation agreement \xc2\xa0with Iran.</b> The agreement provides Iran with technology and resources that eventually become the foundation for its controversial nuclear program, which it begins developing in the 1970s with support from the US.<b>Obama\'s administration orchestrated the landmark pact known as the Iran nuclear deal , which was finalized in July 2015 and aimed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions.</b><b>As a result of the Iranian takeover of the American Embassy on November 4, 1979, the United States and Iran severed diplomatic relations in April 1980.</b> <b>The United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran have had no formal diplomatic relationship since that date.</b> Switzerland is the U.S. protecting power and provides limited consular services to U.S. citizens in Iran.<b>Forty years after the 1979 Iranian Revolution , relations between the United States and Iran are as tense as they have ever been.</b> As Iran advances its nuclear program and trains proxy forces throughout the Middle East, the potential for conflict continues to increase. Iran has pursued a nuclear program since at least 1957, with varying degrees of success. By the late 1980s during a brutal war with Iraq , Iran decided to develop nuclear weapons to ensure its security and, consequently, Iran pursued nuclear agreements with China and Russia throughout the 1990s to support its ongoing research into the development of nuclear weapons.<b>From the CIA-orchestrated overthrow of Iran's prime minister in 1953, to tension and confrontation under President Trump, a look back over more than 65 years of tricky relations between Iran and the US.</b><b>The U.S. has had relations with Iran ever since the last quarter of the nineteenth century.</b> American missionaries have been in Iran even longer than that. But the United States\xe2\x80\x99 real engagement with Iran dates only from WWII. The relationship has generally been close, but it has been punctuated first by the involvement of the CIA in the coup of 1953 which overthrew a popular prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and then by the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which led to a breach in relations that has not yet been repaired.<b>A popular narrative to emerge during the past year of Iran-U.S. tensions is that on several occasions\xe2\x80\x94particularly after the killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in January\xe2\x80\x94Iran and the United States were on the \xe2\x80\x9c brink of war .\xe2\x80\x9d This narrative has been promoted by Iranian officials who encourage the belief\xe2\x80\x94as part of their efforts to deter the United States\xe2\x80\x94that a local clash could easily escalate to an \xe2\x80\x9c all-out \xe2\x80\x9d war.</b> It has likewise been promoted by President Trump, who stated in a private talk to TV anchors in February, with typical bravado, that war with Iran was \xe2\x80\x9c closer than you thought .\xe2\x80\x9d And it has been promoted by a variety of journalists , academics and think tank analysts . Yet, this widely accepted version of events distorts reality, precludes a clear-headed understanding of Iranian and U.S. actions, and hinders an effective policy response.<b>The United States and Iran sign the Cooperation Concerning Civil Uses of Atoms agreement as part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAtoms for Peace\xe2\x80\x9d initiative, under which developing countries receive nuclear education and technology from the United States.</b> It lays the foundation for the country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and the United States later provides Iran with a reactor and weapons-grade enriched uranium fuel. Their collaboration continues until the start of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s 1979 revolution.<b>American officials have suddenly raised the stakes in the long-simmering tensions between the United States and Iran , pointing to new intelligence that they say suggests an imminent threat to American interests in the Middle East.</b><b>The current United States administration has made its issues with Iran clear.</b> However, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to take a look at how the cultures of the United States and Iran differ and how social learning and organizational change can prevent us from the worst option, war.Any potential armed conflict between the United States, its allies, and Iran would likely result in a closure of the Strait of Hormuz. <b>Iran has repeatedly threatened to block the strait in the event that the United States or its allies attack it.</b> Other threats made by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have been directed towards Israel, which is the United States\xe2\x80\x99 greatest ally in the Middle East. Actually, Iran has already attacked Israel many times, though it usually does so using various proxies.<b>Relations between the United States and Iran have been fraught for decades \xe2\x80\x93 at least since the U.S. helped overthrow a democracy-minded prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, in August 1953.</b> <b>The U.S. then supported the long, repressive reign of the shah of Iran, whose security services brutalized Iranian citizens for decades.</b><b>Tensions between Iran and the United States have simmered for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but in recent weeks their longstanding tensions appear to be boiling over.</b><b>The nations had been in a decades-long state of hostility: from the 1979 hostage crisis (which saw 52 American diplomats and citizens held captive by pro-Islamic Iranian revolutionaries in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran) to the Iran-Contra affair of the Ronald Reagan era to the Bill Clinton administration banning the exchange of goods with Iran in 1995.</b> For Iranian-Americans, each event made it hard to keep ties with the country of their birth, or that of their relatives.<b> One of the reasons Iran has so often wrong footed the US is that the two nations have had no diplomatic relations at all since 1979.</b> And as Vinjamuri says, this has created \xe2\x80\x9can absolute absence of knowledge and understanding\xe2\x80\x9d of the Iranian view.

Globally, around 11 million people inject drugs. <b>Approximately 1 in 8 (or 1.4 million) of these people are living with HIV (UNODC World Drug Report, 2020), while 39.4% have viremic HCV infection (Grebely et al., Addiction, 2019).</b><b> Despite significant reductions in morbidity and mortality secondary to availability of effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection still accounts for 1.5 million deaths annually.</b> The majority of deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where rates of opportunistic co-infections are disproportionately high. In this review, we discuss the immunopathogenesis of five common infections that cause significant morbidity in HIV-infected patients globally. These include co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Plasmodium falciparum.<b> Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the cause of more than three-quarters of liver-related deaths in HIV-seropositive individuals and it is remarkable that today approximately one-quarter of HIV-infected individuals in Europe and the USA have a HCV coinfection.</b> HIV/HCV coinfected patients were more likely to develop cirrhosis, had an increased risk of developing AIDS, of HIV-related disease and of overall mortality. <b>How HCV may affect the course of HIV infection is not well known even if it was suggested that HCV co-infection is able to increase immune activation and to sensitize CD4+ T-cells towards apoptosis in the absence of HIV therapy.</b> <b>There are many evidences that the simultaneous presence of HIV infection accelerates the liver damage from HCV favouring the evolution to cirrhosis in co-infected patients.</b><b>WHO recommends that every person who may be at risk of HIV should access testing.</b> People at increased risk of acquiring HIV should seek comprehensive and effective HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. <b>HIV infection can be diagnosed using simple and affordable rapid diagnostic tests, as well as self-tests.</b> It is important that HIV testing services follow the 5Cs: consent, confidentiality, counselling, correct results and connection with treatment and other services.<b> Since the decline in HIV-related morbidity and mortality after introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996, liver disease caused by chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients infected parenterally with HCV in more developed countries.</b> <b>A third of HIV-infected individuals in Europe and the USA have HCV co-infection.</b> HIV accelerates HCV liver disease especially when HIV-associated immunodeficiency progresses. With the introduction of pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, greatly improved treatment options for patients with HIV and HCV co-infection have become available and have led to sustained virological response rates of up to 40%.<b> Co-infection with hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus is common in certain populations.</b> Among HCV (+) persons, 10 % are also HIV (+), and among HIV (+) persons, 25 % are also HCV (+).

Some people recover on their own, while others develop a life-threatening infection or further complications, including cirrhosis or cancer. <b>There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment remains low.</b><b>About 1% of persons living with HBV infection (2.7 million people) are also infected with HIV.</b> Conversely, the global prevalence of HBV infection in HIV-infected persons is 7.4%. <b>Since 2015, WHO has recommended treatment for everyone diagnosed with HIV infection, regardless of the stage of disease.</b> Tenofovir, which is included in the treatment combinations recommended as first-line therapy for HIV infection, is also active against HBV.<b>This guidance provides CDC recommendations for laboratory testing and follow-up of health care personnel (HCP) who have been potentially exposed to hepatitis C virus (HCV) through an exposure to blood or other infectious body fluid.</b> Although sharps injury prevention measures have led to overall decreases in exposures in recent decades, HCP blood and body fluid exposures and sharp object injuries continue to occur in health care settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, emergency departments, and during provision of in-home services.

Elsewhere, the issue is even more pronounced\xe2\x80\x94in Britain and Australia , the absence of a land border of the kind the United States has with Mexico and Canada means that nearly all illegal immigration comes in the form of visa overstays.<b>A rising share of U.S. unauthorized immigrants apparently arrived in the country legally but overstayed their visas .</b> Nearly all people apprehended while attempting to enter the country illegally at the U.S.-Mexico border are from either Mexico or Central America . This stands in contrast to the origins of visa overstays .<b>Legal immigration to the United States occurs through an alphabet soup of visa categories, but a small number of pathways.</b> Family relationships, ties to employers, or the need for humanitarian protection are the top channels for immigrants seeking temporary or permanent U.S. residence. And to a lesser extent, people can come if they possess sought-after skills or are selected in the green-card lottery. Visa categories have varying requirements, are subject to different numerical caps, and offer differing rights and responsibilities.An “overstay” is a non-immigrant visitor who was admitted for a specified time but remained longer without permission. <b>Most overstay data pertains to non-immigrant visitors who came here through the Visa Waiver Program , which allows eligible aliens from 38 countries to enter the United States as non-immigrant visitors without going through the visa process .</b><b> ""Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the U.S.) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa.""</b>;<b>Undocumented aliens come here from all over the world — and visa overstays are as great a problem as those illegal border crossings shown nightly on TV and debated endlessly in Congress.</b><b>Immigration agents catch an abysmally small percentage of the illegal immigrants who arrived on visas but overstayed their welcome, authorities admitted to Congress Tuesday, describing a loophole that those around the globe are increasingly using to gain a foothold in the U.S. .</b><b>Aims To Track Foreigners Who Arrive, But Never Leave Almost half of all undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. came legally \xe2\x80\x94 but then overstayed their visas.</b> <b>In an effort to curb those ""overstays,"" the Senate is considering a bill that mandates tracking visitors\' visas when they leave the country, not just when they arrive.</b> Pedestrians crossing from Mexico into the United States at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry wait to use biometric kiosks in San Diego. <b>A new study says visa overstays exceeded illegal border crossings.</b> Denis Poroy/AP hide caption toggle caption Denis Poroy/AP .<b>Congress Border wall debate ignores biggest source of illegal immigration: visa overstays But stopping travelers from overstaying their visas isn\xe2\x80\x99t a simple fix.</b><b>These immigrants, who enter countries legally on student, tourist, or work visas and then stay past their visa\xe2\x80\x99s expiration date, are often overlooked in the discussion of illegal immigration.</b> <b>But in the past 10 years, visa overstays in the United States have outnumbered border crossings by a ratio of about 2 to 1, according to Robert Warren, who was for a decade the director of the statistics division at the agency that has since been renamed U.S.</b> Citizenship and Immigration Services, and who is now a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, a New York\xe2\x80\x93based organization. <b>Elsewhere, the issue is even more pronounced\xe2\x80\x94in Britain and Australia , the absence of a land border of the kind the United States has with Mexico and Canada means that nearly all illegal immigration comes in the form of visa overstays.</b><b>There is no current comprehensive system to assure that the immigration authorities know whether persons who have been admitted as nonimmigrants remain in the country illegally.</b> <b>The illegal aliens who do not leave when their entry permit expires are referred to as overstayers.</b> The current debate on immigration reform has as a central issue the question of how to combat illegal immigration, and that debate usually revolves around the issue of border control.

This, the public-health experts I spoke with for this story all agreed, would be neither feasible nor desirable. <b>Broad restrictions on travel and large indoor gatherings, they said, also seem like nonstarters (though Seema Lakdawala, a flu-transmission expert at the University of Pittsburgh, suggested that companies might consider rescheduling their annual holiday party for the summer and moving it outdoors).</b> Even more moderate capacity limitations, though beneficial from a health perspective, Popescu told me, are \xe2\x80\x9ctricky for business.\xe2\x80\x9d.<b>Published August 31, 2022 2:53pm EDT Berkeley to require students who have not received flu shot to mask up Critics of the requirement sounded off on social media.</b><b>Having been introduced to the idea of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, some Americans are now considering a behavior scarcely seen in the United States but long a fixture in other cultures: routinely wearing a mask when displaying symptoms of a common cold or the flu, even in a future in which Covid-19 isn\xe2\x80\x99t a primary concern.</b><b>In some cases, wearing a mask might help protect you from the human influenza A and B viruses — the ones responsible for most seasonal outbreaks of the flu (influenza).</b> <b>But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) generally suggests that only health care workers who are in close contact with people with the flu wear masks.</b><b>What\xe2\x80\x99s also different this year is that there is no federal mandate to wear masks on public transportation .</b> And even though cases of the coronavirus have been ticking up, there is no suggestion that mandates will be reinstated.<b>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in May that fully vaccinated individuals didn\'t need to wear masks in most settings — but that guidance changed last week in light of new data and rising cases.</b> Health and Wellness Can Face Masks for COVID-19 Also Protect You from the Flu? <b>Here's how to keep yourself (and others) safe from influenza and COVID-19 this flu season.</b><b>Workers who perform certain types of healthcare tasks for patients who may have the flu are at a higher risk of exposure to the seasonal flu virus and need additional precautions to protect them from workplace infection.</b> This page gives employers and managers information about how to protect workers who perform tasks that require close contact with patients who may have the flu. It also lists precautions for tasks involving close contact with specimens or contaminated materials from flu patients. Workers who are at risk include those who perform direct patient care, aerosol-generating procedures, specimen analysis, and other patient support, like dietary and housekeeping services.<b>The Centers for Disease Control Prevention on Monday encouraged people to wear masks to help reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses this season as Covid, flu and RSV circulate at the same time.</b><b>There are no longer any states requiring people generally to wear masks in public places.</b> Several states still mandate masking for most people in certain high-risk settings, including health care and long-term care facilities .\xc2\xa0 .<b>The following interim CDC guidance was developed in response to questions about the role of masks for controlling seasonal influenza virus transmission.</b><b>Mask-wearing to protect against seasonal flu should work together with other measures, including vaccination, hand-washing, social-distancing and quarantining when you feel sick, says Ali Jaffry, M.D.</b> , infectious disease specialist at Palisades Medical Center. Best Way to Prevent the Flu .2 Administrative Requirements for Offering Vaccination The healthcare facility must offer a vaccination to a healthcare worker or patient. 3 Administrative Requirements for Ensuring Vaccination The healthcare facility must require a healthcare worker or patient to demonstrate proof of vaccination or immunity against a specific vaccine preventable disease. <b>4 Surgical Mask Requirements The healthcare worker must wear a surgical mask during influenza (flu) season if he or she has been exempted from or declined flu vaccination.</b><b>Asa Hutchinson announced that beginning on Monday, July 20, residents 10 years and older must wear masks when in the presence of non-household members and aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to socially distance.</b> The order is enforceable and offenders can be cited for a misdemeanor or fined.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s advice on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is simple: Wash your hands , practice social distancing and wear a mask . That last guideline, however, has been a sticking point. <b>Some states have had a mandatory order for everyone to wear a face mask in public since April , while others have yet to do that.</b>;Transmission-based precautions are a set of practices specific for patients with known or suspected infectious agents that require additional control measures to prevent transmission. <b>These precautions are used in addition to standard precautions.</b><b>The state lifted many of its remaining safety restrictions in June 2021.</b>;",0,2,3

[8] In addition, the child tax credit went from $500 to $1000, and the "" marriage penalty "" reduced. Since the cuts got implemented as part of the annual congressional budget resolution, which protected the bill from filibusters, numerous amendments, and more than 20 hours of debate, it had to include a sunset clause.<b> The Bush tax cuts were two tax code changes that President George W. Bush authorized during his first term.</b> <b>Congress enacted tax cuts to families in 2001 and to investors in 2003.</b> They were supposed to expire at the end of 2010. Congress extended them for two more years, and many of the tax provisions remain in effect and continue to affect the economy.<b>The president laid out the tax hikes as part of his $5.8 trillion budget blueprint for federal spending in fiscal 2023, which begins in October.</b> Under his proposal, taxes would rise by $2.5 trillion, marking the largest increase in history in dollar terms. The deficit would be $1.15 trillion.<b>\xe2\x80\x9cScott Walker has called for nearly $3 billion in tax cuts, loopholes and shifts that unfairly benefit the rich and big business and he needs to come clean about the drastic cuts to education, health care and police and fire protection he\xe2\x80\x99ll need to make to pay for them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now Executive Director.</b> \xe2\x80\x9cScott Walker owes the people of Milwaukee County real answers about his failed mismanagement and the harm caused to his constituents.\xe2\x80\x9d .<b>In 2014, Walker, who was then the chief deputy Nassau County executive, accepted a $5,000 cash payment from a contractor who was performing work pursuant to a contract for Nassau County.</b> In 2017, Walker learned that the United States Attorney\'s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the FBI had opened a grand jury investigation of potential corruption in Nassau County government, including the circumstances surrounding the $5,000 payment made by the contractor to the defendant. Walker spoke to the contractor on several occasions and attempted to persuade him to conceal the existence of the $5,000 payment from the grand jury, or to provide a false explanation to the grand jury concerning the transaction, for example, saying it was repayment of a loan. Walker arranged to meet the contractor in a park in Hicksville, New York, and at that meeting, gave the contractor an envelope containing $5,000 in an effort to make it appear as if the payment Walker accepted ""never happened.""<b>Walker set the tone and the agenda for sweeping conservative reforms over arguably the two most active terms in Badger State history and steeled the courage of the Republican lawmakers who swept into office in 2010\xe2\x80\x99s red wave.</b><b>Walker came nowhere near his vow to create 250,000 jobs during his first term.</b> However, during his eight years, unemployment plummeted as Wisconsin and the rest of the country bounced back from the Great Recession.<b>The 2022 Executive Budget includes the eighth consecutive County property tax reduction and provides the seventh straight property tax rate decrease for homeowners and businesses.</b> The 2022 property tax levy, the amount the County collects in property taxes, proposed in the Executive Budget is $99.8 million, $5.5 million less than the 2021 levy, representing the largest decrease in County history .;",0,0,3

(AP) -- Wisconsin's state budget condition has worsened to the point that Gov. Scott Walker and possibly the Legislature will need to take emergency steps to avoid being out of balance. The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau on Thursday released the new projections that show the two-year budget will be $143 million short of balancing by July 2013. <b>That's bad news for Walker, who faces a drive to recall him from office based largely around criticisms of choices he made in the two-year state budget passed last year.</b><b>Here\xe2\x80\x99s an overview of what Walker covered in his address, and what exactly is included in the 2015-2017 biennial budget proposal.</b> What did Walker talk about in his speech?<b>In June, Walker and Republican lawmakers passed a balanced budget according to the measure that is always used for state budgets - cash accounting.</b> That means essentially that the state will have cash left in its main account - an estimated balance of $68 million - when the budget ends on June 30, 2013.<b>When Scott Walker decided to drop the fiscal measures from his controversial bill and ram it through the state legislature, his goal to balance the state budget may have been put in jeopardy.</b>In this section, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find lowlights from Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s budgets, both as county executive and governor. <b>As governor, Walker\xe2\x80\x99s approach has been to reward the wealthy and corporations with tax cuts, both in the budget and through special legislation, while slashing funds to public education, technical colleges, public assistance programs, and the UW System.</b><b>In the 2010 race, Walker made an explicit promise , noted on his campaign website to ""require the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to balance every state budget, just as we require every local government and school district to do.""</b> This is known as the accrual accounting method, something also used by publicly traded companies.

In 2024, as few as six states will decide the contest. <b>Taking those out, the baseline map shows Republicans with 235 electoral votes and Democrats with 226.</b><b>The NBC News National Polling Average is based on an unweighted average of the 10 most recent publicly released public opinion polls that NBC News deems reliable.</b> <b>An organization\xe2\x80\x99s polls are deemed reliable based on methodology (excluding interactive voice response phone polls and opt-in online polls), past performance and transparency.</b><b> FEIST: This is going to be an election like no other.</b> You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that over and over. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that the counting or reporting of the votes are going to be a whole lot different. In fact, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s every reason to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be orderly.<b>The Republican president is being challenged by Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden, who is best known as Barack Obama's vice-president but has been in US politics since the 1970s.</b><b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The political environment for the 2022 midterm elections should work to the benefit of the Republican Party, with all national mood indicators similar to, if not worse than, what they have been in other years when the incumbent party fared poorly in midterms.</b>;<b>Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how errors in correctly representing the level of support for Joe Biden and Donald Trump in preelection polling could affect the accuracy of questions in those same polls (or other polls) that measure public opinion on issues.</b> <b>Specifically, if polls about issues are underrepresenting the Republican base the way that many 2020 preelection polls appeared to, how inaccurate would they be on measures of public opinion about issues?</b> We investigated by taking a set of surveys that measured a wide range of issue attitudes and using a statistical procedure known as weighting to have them mirror two different scenarios. One scenario mirrored the true election outcome among voters (a 4.4-point Biden advantage, and another substantially overstated Biden\xe2\x80\x99s advantage (a 12-point lead).<b>After the 2016 presidential election, some observers understandably questioned whether polling in the United States is still up to the task of producing accurate information.</b> <b>Errors in 2016 laid bare some real limitations of polling, even as clear-eyed reviews of national polls in both 2016 and 2018 found that polls still perform well when done carefully.</b><b>There\xe2\x80\x99s a simple, unassailable truth about polls in the last election: they routinely surveyed more Democrats than Republicans, leading, I believe, to skewed results - a massive head fake that rippled through the markets.</b> I recommend that you not react to polls. Or, better yet, see for yourself by finding the details of how each survey was conducted. <b>Here are a few recent examples of polls that garnered big headlines but that might just be inaccurate.</b><b>Sample Answer: Public opinion polls are not always accurate because they can reflect bias depending upon the sampled polled, as when the sample is too narrow and is not accurately reflective of the population.</b> <b>Also, respondents are not always truthful; this can impact the accuracy of the poll.</b> <b>Finally, the reliability of polls can be questioned.</b> <b>Some polls may be worded oddly or in a confusing manner.</b><b>If 2016 taught us anything, it\'s that pre-election polls can be wildly unreliable.</b> Here\'s how to make sense of the data-heavy madness.<b>With fluctuations in overall \xe2\x80\x9c polls of polls \xe2\x80\x9d as the referendum approaches, can these polls be trusted \xe2\x80\x93 particularly given the glaring failures to predict the outcome of the 2015 UK general election.</b><b> Polls can use samples that are too small or don’t accurately represent the population; for example, over sampling democrats Survey questions can ask leading questions framed in a way to get the answer desired Large segments of the population may be left out by certain polling methods; for example, those who don’t use the web often or who don’t answer unknown numbers on calls Poll results can be recorded in a dishonest or sloppy way Polls reflect only a snapshot in time that may be distorted by a recent event, such as a mass shooting or terrorist attack Political correctness and militancy of prominent liberals often lead to answers that don’t reflect the respondent’s true feelings Polls can leave out possible answers, forcing respondents to pick from remaining answers that don’t include what they really believe Poll results can be presented in a misleading way; for example, leaving out poll disclaimers or the impact of “undecided” & “no opinion” answers The poll may not reflect the portion of the population that really matters; for example, a national poll doesn’t matter for a local election; a poll of “all adults” or “registered voters” doesn’t matter as much as “likely voters” never The media cherry picks which polls to present as “news” and which ones to leave out, choosing those that meet their story narrative objective Investors Business Daily .</b>;",0,8,9

In such cases, the noncustodial parent will usually be given a basic set of visitation rights. Visitation rights are what enable a parent to visit and spend time with a separated couple\xe2\x80\x99s children.<b>Child custody when one parent is in jail can be a complicated matter.</b> <b>To many, it sounds logical that when one parent gets locked up in prison, they lose their parental rights.</b> However, this is not always the case.<b>Child Protective Services can take your child from home only if the agency has a court order authorizing it to do so or if a CPS caseworker believes that an emergency situation exists to warrant an “emergency removal.”.</b><b>If the act that constitutes the violation of a protection order is itself a felony, the adverse party can be punished by imprisonment in the state prison ""for a term equal to and in addition to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute"" for the act that constitutes the violation.</b>If you are involved in a divorce in the State of Texas, chances are you are going to have a “Morality Clause” slapped on you. What is a “Morality Clause”? <b>Well, in simple terms, it is a prohibition against a parent allowing anyone with whom they are involved in a dating or romantic situation to spend the night while the divorce is ongoing.</b> The intent and purpose of the clause are well-meaning and noble.As opposed to Child Support Services actions, discussed below, a custodial parent can also bring an action for contempt against the noncustodial parent. <b>This is common if the original order to establish child support was issued by a superior court, such as through a divorce or legitimation action.</b>;March 3, 2017 \xe2\x80\x93 The Trump administration is considering a proposal to begin separating children from their mothers at the border as a way to deter future migrants, Reuters reports . <b>The policy would allow the government to keep parents in custody while they await asylum hearings or contest deportation.</b><b>Programme \t Children separated from their families Children can be separated from their families for a variety of reasons and in such instances the care provided must be the best for their continued well-being.</b>Administration officials explained that the goal of the program is 100 percent prosecution of all who enter the U.S. illegally. <b>When adults are prosecuted and jailed, their children will be separated from them, just as would happen for a U.S. citizen convicted and jailed.</b><b>And they had to separate all of the children.</b><b> Immigrant Children Separated From Parents At The Border: What We Know The Trump administration Wednesday reversed a policy of separating families at the border, which had meant children were held at detention facilities and moved to shelters.</b> What comes next is unclear.<b>In 95% of cases where women are imprisoned, children have to move out of the family home.</b> Research suggests the separation and upheaval has a lasting impact.On this point, the secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, is right. <b>Family separation is a fact of life here, happening hundreds \xe2\x80\x94 if not thousands \xe2\x80\x94 of times a day.</b> \xe2\x80\x9cIn the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe call that law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d.The Trump administration launched a ""zero tolerance"" policy on the southwest border in April. <b>But officials floated the idea of separating children from parents at the border more than a year earlier as a way to deter illegal crossings.</b><b>Over a recent six-week period, nearly 2,000 children were separated from their parents after illegally crossing the border, figures released on Friday said.</b><b>In one photo, a little girl looks up at a U.S. Border Patrol agent, her expression filled with grief as her mom is arrested.</b> In secretly captured recordings, voices of toddlers inside detention centers cry out for absent parents.<b>A pproximately 5,500 migrant children have been separated from their parents by the Trump Administration — not 2,800 as originally estimated — according to the ACLU who received a court-ordered accounting of each of the families by the government on Thursday.</b> <b>The accounting shows an additional 1,556 children were separated and approximately 1,000 children have been separated from their parents since the practice was declared over by the Trump Administration in June 2018.</b><b>In this post, we’re answering a question we received from Shari Best: Why do they take the children away from their parents at the border?</b><b>In the past, immigrants charged with this misdemeanor were able to stay in shelters with their children while waiting for further direction.</b><b>Under federal law , the temporary detention, care and placement of unaccompanied children falls in the hands of the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of Health and Human Services.</b> Unaccompanied minors from Mexico and Canada go through a screening and repatriation process at the border. Children from other countries, however, are placed into one of about 100 shelters nationwide while they work their way through the immigration system.<b>What consequences would a parent face if they forced their own child to live in a cage?</b> Their actions would be considered child abuse and neglect, and such conduct is condemned by our institutions!<b>For imprisoned mothers, one of the greatest punishments incarceration carries with it is separation from their children.</b> As one mother put it, ""I can do time alone OK. But its not knowing what\'s happening to my son that hurts most"" (Baunach, 1988, p. 121, cited in Garcia Coll et al., 1998). <b>As this quote suggests, when parents are incarcerated, ""what\'s happening"" to their children is a great concern.</b>;",0,2,8
