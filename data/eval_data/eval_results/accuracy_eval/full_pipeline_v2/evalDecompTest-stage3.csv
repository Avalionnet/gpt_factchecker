Weiner.The Constitution provides that the President and Vice President have four-year terms and are eligible to be re-elected. Starting with George Washington as the first President, no person ever attempted to serve more than two terms as President until in 1940 Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected to a third term and then a fourth term in 1944. In response to Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s longevity, Republicans proposed the Twenty-second Amendment which was adopted in 1951 limiting the President to no more than two terms. Consequently, the transference of presidential power occurs frequently and has generally gone smoothly, if not always cordially.Despite President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses the election, he does have a team cooperating on a plan with a team from the Biden campaign.

Lee\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the institution of slavery. It has been falsely claimed by some that Lee never owned enslaved people. Others, often confusing the enslaved people owned by Lee with the enslaved people who he managed at Arlington House, falsely claim that Lee owned hundreds of enslaved people. The specifics of Lee\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with slavery are complicated.Lee\xe2\x80\x99s views on slavery are also central to his story because they influenced decisions that would have profound consequences for the United States. Slavery shaped his resolution to fight for the South. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s opinions also served as a beacon for generations of Southerners as they struggled to comprehend the tragedy of the war. Without an understanding of Lee\xe2\x80\x99s racial attitudes, it is impossible to make sense of either his own actions or his strong impact on Southern society.In short, many Virginians, including some who were very close to Lee, did not abandon the United States during the secession crisis.After white nationalists protested the City of Charlottesville’s plan to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E.

It\xe2\x80\x99s reminiscent of what Mexico experienced during the presidency of Felipe Calder\xc3\xb3n from 2006 to 2012.FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday said there is ""no question"" that cartel activity from Mexico is ""spilling over"" into the U.S. \xe2\x80\x93 as the country faces a historic crisis at the southern border triggered by a massive surge in migration .Even as travel is discouraged to all of Mexico because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. State Department continues to update its warnings concerning kidnappings and other crimes in the country’s states.<b>A Mexican state governor issued a warning about traveling to the border, citing recent spikes in cartel violence.</b> The alert comes soon after Gulf Cartel gunmen killed 15 innocent civilians in Reynosa and Los Zetas kidnapped more than 100 individuals in Nuevo Laredo.<b>Amid announcements of new safety concerns in Mexico at the start of 2023, the official U.S. State Department travel advisories remained as they had been for several months, with six states in the “do not travel” classification.</b>As Americans prepare to pack up their books and hit the beaches, many are hearing an increasingly strong warning from the U.S. government: Think twice before traveling to Mexico.An apparent case of mistaken identity of two Americans and a local bystander in a Mexican border town earlier this month, reigniting an intense debate over what the United States can do to stem drug cartel violence that\xe2\x80\x99s plagued its southern neighbor and also caused immense suffering north of the border.26) Certain organizations like Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel present more of an imminent threat than foreign terrorists entering through the southern border.Fourth, the Mexican government has long opposed the addition of the cartels to the FTO list. President Obrador has already publicly stated his opposition to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s idea. When interviewer Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly asked Trump whether the United States would use drones (presumably armed ones) against the cartels, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say no. There must be great apprehension in Mexico that the United States might violate Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty in hot pursuit of the cartels.<b> The State Department has issued warnings advising against travel to Mexican border states and the president has considered labeling cartels as terrorist organizations.</b> But Trump officials continue to downplay the violence in cities where ""remain in Mexico"" is in place.<b> Says the cartels are so bad in a Mexican border state that the U.S. government issued a ‘Do Not Travel’ warning -- the same warning it issued for Syria.</b>In fact, during the violence in Tijuana and Mexico’s Baja this weekend, the U.S. Embassy ordered Americans to stay inside. We are literally hiding from the people killing thousands and thousands of Americans every year. It should come as no surprise.What if \xe2\x80\x9crather than just interdicting at the border, we go to the source and declare Mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations under U.S. law? Would you consider that?\xe2\x80\x9d U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, asked Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. Part of L\xc3\xb3pez Obrador\xe2\x80\x99s plan was to form a National Guard which, in theory would be deployed to hotspots throughout the country to improve security. However, thousands of those troops were given the mission of stopping the flow of Central American migrants, not curbing crime: A 15,000-strong contingent was sent to the U.S.-Mexico border in June. An additional 2,000 members of the guard were sent to Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s southern border with Guatemala, adding to the 4,500 troops already spread across the area.Country Summary : Violent crime \xe2\x80\x93 such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery \xe2\x80\x93 is widespread and common in Mexico. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico, as travel by U.S. government employees to certain areas is prohibited or restricted. In many states, local emergency services are limited outside the state capital or major cities.<b> Says the cartels are so bad in a Mexican border state that the U.S. government issued a ‘Do Not Travel’ warning -- the same warning it issued for Syria.</b>;",0,9,13

After the election, Ed Klein, a discredited author known for peddling extremely dubious claims about political figures, claimed on Fox & Friends that Obama and his aides were actually using that new home for \xe2\x80\x9csetting up what they\'re calling a shadow government,\xe2\x80\x9d which is \xe2\x80\x9calmost an insurgency,\xe2\x80\x9d to oppose Trump once he became president. The claim remained generally dormant until February 2017, when Paul Sperry, a New York Post columnist who was formerly the Washington bureau chief for far-right conspiracy theory outlet WorldNetDaily , published a column claiming that Obama had \xe2\x80\x9can army of agitators\xe2\x80\x9d against Trump whom he would command \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a bunker less than two miles from the White House,\xe2\x80\x9d adding it would \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively be a shadow government.\xe2\x80\x9d The conspiracy theory spread among far-right and fake news outlets before reaching more traditional right-wing media. Fake news websites further expanded on the conspiracy theory later in the year, suggesting \xe2\x80\x9cshadow president\xe2\x80\x9d Obama was violating the Logan Act, a law barring private citizens from interfering with American foreign policy. He’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda.Obama\'s post-presidency plans are to continue living in Washington D.C. until his youngest daughter, Sasha, graduates high school in 2019. But on Fox & Friends , Ed Klein, an author who has been accused of fabricating claims about politicians, said that Obama and his aides were ""setting up what they\'re calling a shadow government,"" in the house. In February 2017, The New York Post reported that Obama was controlling ""an army of agitators"" and running a shadow government ""from a bunker less than two miles from the White House."" The claim spread across far-right blogs and websites. He’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda.\xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama himself said he was gonna stay in Washington until his daughter graduated. I think we oughta pitch in to let him go somewhere else because he\xe2\x80\x99s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly told a gathering in his home state on Saturday.
