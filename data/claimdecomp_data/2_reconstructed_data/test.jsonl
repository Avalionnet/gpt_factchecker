Andy Barr \"would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops\" and that he took \"$36,550 from payday lenders.\"","person":"With Honor","venue":"stated on September 10, 2018 in a TV ad:","justification":"With Honor says Barr \"would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops\" and that he received $36,550 in campaign donations from payday lenders.\nIt is true that Bar has accepted $36,550 in donations from payday lenders. But the other part is more complicated.\nBarr voted for legislation that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s power over payday lending agencies, which could indirectly affect military families as the agency fields complaints from the community.\nHowever, a 2006 law provides servicemembers protection, with a 36 percent cap on the interest small-dollar lenders could charge families.\nSo while the CFPB could have provided more protections to the military community than the 2006 law, the ad makes it appear as if Barr\u2019s actions were connected to legislation specifically about veterans.\nWe rate it Half True.","full_article":"The \"cross-partisan\" group With Honor, which\u00a0formed to support military veterans running for Congress, has backed Democratic challenger and Marine veteran Amy McGrath.\nMcGrath is running against Republican incumbent Andy Barr for the U.S. House seat in central Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District.\nThe September ad lambastes Barr\u2019s support of the payday lending business.\nThe ad says that Barr has accepted campaign donations from payday lending organizations and that he would let them take advantage of service members and their families.\n\"In Kentucky, we respect our troops, but Congressman Andy Barr would let shady payday lenders take advantage of them,\" the ad says. It goes on to say that he took \"$36,550 from payday lenders, then let them stick our troops with outrageous fees. It\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with Congress.\"\nIt is no secret that payday lenders routinely sock consumers with excessively high charges and fees. But did Barr \"let them\" stick military families with outrageous fees, while also taking money from them for his campaign?\nYes and no.\nFirst, some background\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \"payday loans are small-dollar, short-term, unsecured loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck or regular income payment.\" Payday loans often include very high interest rates or fees.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama through the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010,\u00a0launched the nation's first program for supervising \"non-bank\" financial services, which include payday loan providers, as well as debt collectors, mortgage companies and credit-score companies.\nSo what did Barr do, exactly?\nAt issue is Barr\u2019s 2017 vote for the Financial CHOICE Act, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Barr was one of seven original cosponsors of the bill.\nThe bill would make sweeping changes and repeal provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, in part by weakening the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nUnder the plan, the agency would lose its oversight of payday lenders. There is a line in the legislation that says, \"the agency may not exercise any rulemaking, enforcement, or other authority with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans.\u2019\u2019\nWith Honor spokeswoman Ellen Zeng also pointed to a June 2017 Military.com article that grappled with whether the bill would undo certain protections for active and retired service members and their families.\nThe bureau has played a major role in \"providing restitution and help to troops taken advantage of by illegal financial practices,\" the article states.\nOne program, in the bureau's\u00a0Office of Servicemember Affairs department, has fielded over 74,000 complaints about predatory financial practices from the military community since 2011, a 2017 CFPB report says, resulting in more than $130 million in relief to affected service members.\nBut then there\u2019s the Military Lending Act\nBarr\u2019s campaign released a statement after the ad aired calling it misleading. There are\u00a0existing laws that protect military families from payday lenders, the campaign said.\nThe 2006 Military Lending Act\u00a0put a 36 percent cap on the amount of interest small-dollar lenders could charge on loans to military families.\nWhen veterans groups raised concerns about the Financial CHOICE Act, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who sponsored the bill and chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said it would not touch protections for veterans.\n\"The Financial Choice Act does not weaken the laws that specifically protect active-duty and retired members of our armed forces,\" he said in a June 2017 statement.\nZeng says the group stands by the ad, as the bill would have drained the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she says plays a vital role in protecting military veterans and their families from predatory payday lenders.\nDid Barr collect over $36,000 from payday lenders?\nThis part is pretty straight-forward. Yes, he did.\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database of campaign finance data, Barr has accepted $36,550 from PACs and individuals associated with the payday lending industry since his 2014 campaign. He has received $7,500 from payday lenders in 2018."}

But it doesn\u2019t say how much he was paid for consulting for the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns.\nIn short, Baldwin cites no evidence to show how much money Nicholson was paid consulting for those companies. And we don\u2019t know whether Nicholson\u2019s work had anything to do with the layoffs and the shutdowns. There\u2019s simply no evidence of what he did for those companies.\nBaldwin\u2019s statement contains only some element of truth  \u2014 our definition of Mostly False.","full_article":"U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin used a TV ad to attack both Republicans who are seeking to unseat her, but the Wisconsin Democrat trained her heavier fire on former Marine Kevin Nicholson.\nNicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are vying in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary. The winner will take on Baldwin Nov. 6, 2018.\nIn Baldwin\u2019s ad, released online on July 31, 2018, the narrator asserts:\nNew reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.\nSo, Baldwin is portraying Nicholson as being paid big money to play a role in shutting down plants and laying off people.\nThere is a connection.\nBut there is less here than meets the eye.\nAssociated Press story\nTo back up the narrator\u2019s statement, this headline from an Associated Press news story is shown on the screen: \"Nicholson consulted for companies that shed jobs.\"\nThe AP said in the story, posted eight days before the launch of the ad, that the story was based on information provided by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge. American Bridge also produced a video that makes an attack on Nicholson similar to the one in the Baldwin ad.\nAccording to the AP article, Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states as they moved to save money and shift production overseas.\nExamples included a company that bought Brillion Iron Works near Green Bay through a subsidiary in September 2016 and two weeks later announced it was shutting down the plant, resulting in a loss of 345 jobs.\nTo be clear:\nThe article said Nicholson did consulting for companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.\nBut it did not say that Nicholson provided any consulting on those decisions.\nThe article also said Nicholson has reported being paid $362,417 in salary and $808,180 in fees (which is a total of more than $1.1 million) from 27 clients between January 2016 and November 2017. But the article did not say how much he was paid for the companies that did the layoffs and shutdowns.\nWhat we don\u2019t know\nAn executive for ghSMART, the company that employs Nicholson, told us ghSMART helps companies \"interview, evaluate and develop their senior leadership\" and \"has never advised any clients on whether to close a plant or conduct employee layoffs.\"\nAnd Nicholson\u2019s campaign has reiterated those points, while also going so far in condemning the AP article as to call the reporter a \"liberal hack.\"\nBut Nicholson and his company have also described their work as being more broad, involving more than merely advising about executive leadership.\nThe AP pointed out that, according to the ghSMART website, the firm works with companies and investors on \"management assessment and organizational change initiatives.\" Nicholson himself, the AP noted, has said his job involves helping companies design strategies for growth, assisting with mergers and acquisitions, and problem solving. And Nicholson\u2019s campaign has described his work as \"helping companies solve their toughest problems.\"\nIn short: We simply don\u2019t know what Nicholson may have advised the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns."}

Significantly, agencies say, anyone getting such a call should hang up and consider filing a complaint with an independent arm of the U.S. Treasury.\nWarning message\nWe transcribed the warning, which was left as a voice mail on a cell phone with a number starting with the 512 area code. In the message, an automated voice said:\n\"We have received a notification regarding your tax filings from the headquarters which will get expired in next 24 working hours. And once it gets expired after that, you will be taken into custody by the local cops as there are more serious allegations pressed on your name at this moment. We would request you to get back to us so that we can discuss about this case before taking any legal action against you.\"\nFederal agency battles criminal callers\nNext, we hunted for governmental guidance about such calls.\nIn a March 2016 press release, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration stressed that if the IRS wants a taxpayer\u2019s attention, the first contact is generally through the U.S. mail. Also, the IRS \"will not ask for payment using a prepaid debit card, a money order or a wire transfer. The IRS also will not ask for a credit card number or your bank information over the phone,\" TIGTA said.\nAt the time, TIGTA said it had fielded reports of some 5,500 victims collectively paying about $29 million \"as a result of the scam in which criminals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials and demanding that they send them cash via prepaid debit cards, money orders or wire transfers from their banks.\"\nIn December 2017, TIGTA issued a fresh release stating that from October 2013 through mid-November 2017, more than 2.1 million taxpayers reported receiving phone contacts from scammers--with over 12,400 victims collectively reporting payments of more than $61.6 million due to the scam.\nThe TIGTA inspector general, J. Russell George, said in the release that such scammers \"are only succeeding with a handful of victims. On average, between 30 and 40 new victims each week report that they paid the impersonators money. This is a vast improvement over the hundreds of new victims who were reporting last year that they paid the impersonators money.\"\nWhen we emailed our transcript of the April 2018 phone message to TIGTA, spokeswoman Karen Kraushaar replied by email: \"TIGTA has made many arrests in connection with this scam and has numerous investigations underway. To date, as a result of our efforts, a total of 111 individuals have been charged in federal court for their involvement in IRS impersonation scam activity. \u00a0Even so, we are still receiving reports that between 4,000 and 10,000 taxpayers are receiving calls each week, so our work is ongoing.\"\nState and local agencies comment\nWe also shared our transcript of the phone message with the Austin Police Department and the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which has a consumer protection function.\nLisa Cortinas of the APD emailed us a 2017 APD press release describing a scam in which callers purported to represent the IRS with the incoming phone number showing up as an APD number. \"These scammers are not legitimate,\" the release said.\nKayleigh Lovvorn of the attorney general\u2019s office told us by email: \"This is a very common \u2018IRS scam\u2019 that usually increases at tax time across the entire country.\" Lovvorn pointed out a 2017 Paxton press release stating: \"Scam artists tell consumers that they owe back taxes and threaten to have them arrested if they don\u2019t provide immediate payment.\"\nAdvice: Hang up\nThe TIGTA inspector general said in the agency\u2019s 2016 release: \"If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS or in a new twist, the Treasury Department, and uses the threat of legal action if you do not pay immediately, that is a sign that it is not the IRS calling, and your cue to hang up.\n\"Again,\" George said then, \"do not engage with these callers. If they call you, hang up the telephone.\" The APD and Paxton releases each had the same advice."}

He did make it clear that he would try to take advantage of a downturn in the housing market, but any good investor would try to do that.\nWarren\u2019s statement puts Trump\u2019s comments in the wrong context, but she has a point about his buying philosophy. Warren's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/e349a2cd-2c08-4616-9147-8f8045f5dcdb","full_article":"Sen. Elizabeth Warren's speech at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia was designed, in part, to convince Americans that the Republican nominee Donald Trump was no friend of the average person.\nWarren said Democrats fought to get health insurance for more Americans, refinance student loans, end tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas, raise the minimum wage and create a strong consumer agency \"so big banks can't cheat people.\"\n\"Where was Donald Trump? In all these fights, not once did he lift a finger to help working people,\" she said.\n\"Look at his history,\" Warren continued. \"Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap.\"\nShe was referring to the Great Recession, in which the housing mortgage crisis played a major role.\nDid Trump really get excited when the 2008 housing occurred because he saw it as a business opportunity?\nWe touched on this before when Hillary Clinton claimed in a television commercial that \"In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash.\" We ruled that claim Mostly True. But this claim is different.\nWarren's statement suggests that Trump was excited for the crash after it happened or while it was happening. But the only evidence we've seen predates the worst of the recession.\nWe asked Warren's spokeswoman for evidence but didn't hear back.\nHere's what we know.\nThe Trump statement in partly question is rooted in an audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, the controversial project that promised to have Trump teach enrollees how to become wealthy. It has been the subject of three lawsuits from former \"students\" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire.\nThe audiobook is from 2006, when it was not obvious that the real estate market was about to tank but there was concern that inflated prices had produced a bubble that might burst, dropping values.\nIn the recording, Trump is being interviewed. He's asked, \"There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?\"\n\"Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,\" Trump responded. \"You know, if you're in a good cash position \u2014 which I'm in a good cash position today \u2014 then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\"\n\"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money,\" he said in the section posted by CNN.\nHowever, Trump immediately added: \"At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit.\"\nSo Trump didn't think the crash was going to happen.\nThe only other piece of evidence we've seen: A year later, in 2007, Trump told the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down.\n\"People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,\" he told the paper. \"I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\"\nBut once again, it's clear that Trump wasn't predicting the scope of the housing crisis.\n\"Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst,\" the story begins. \"The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts. . . \u00a0'We're talking very minor (problems) compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said.\"\nThe Globe and Mail story said he was advising investors to take advantage of the situation by buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.\nIt's all part of the philosophy that any wise investor uses: buy low and sell high.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to our request for reaction to Warren's statement."}

But, looking back at news reports over the last year, Obama has never explicitly said it was the top national security threat.\nRather, he has said global warming is a threat to the whole world.\nIn an April 2015 weekly address, he said \"there\u2019s no greater threat to our planet than climate change.\"\nIn May 2015,\u00a0Obama also said during a U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement address that climate change \"is one of those most severe threats.\"\n\"So I\u2019m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security,\" Obama said. \"And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country.\"\nWe should also point out that the U.S. military has focused on the potential threat of climate change going back to President George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\nIn a December 2015 interview, Obama defended his remarks on climate change, noting at the same time that while terrorists will be \"defeated,\" climate change is the \"kind of crisis that we can\u2019t deal with through the deployment of Marines.\""}

Kamala Harris has taken a strong stance on gun control, but has she actually threatened to send police to your house to take your guns?\nThe short answer is no. But that hasn\u2019t stopped social media users from spreading a fabricated quote attributed to her that suggests otherwise.\n\"If elected & you don\u2019t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door,\" reads a post attributed to Harris, the newly selected running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.\nHarris didn\u2019t say this. And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim appears to be a mischaracterization of a pledge Harris made during a CNN Presidential Town Hall in April 2019.\n\"Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action,\" Harris said during the town hall.\nHarris continued, clarifying what her executive action would encompass.\n\"And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns,\" Harris said. \"I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license.\"\nDuring the town hall, Harris did not discuss confiscating guns using law enforcement officers. What\u2019s more, a commitment to use \"executive action\" can refer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported.\nAt another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she would also use executive action to implement \"a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country.\"\nIn a follow-up question, Harris was asked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, \"Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to people\u2019s houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here?\"\nHarris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both \"found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others\" and were also \"on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction.\"\n\"I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. We\u2019re talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues,\" Harris said.\nHarris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests.\nAny other evidence? No.\nWhen we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us to an article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, found here.\nIn it, debate moderator David Muir of ABC\u2019s World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future president\u2019s \"constitutional authority\" to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing.\nWhen asked if Biden\u2019s stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, \"I mean I would just say, \u2018Hey Joe, instead of saying no we can\u2019t, let\u2019s say yes we can.\u2019\" Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.)\nOther fact-checking organizations debunked similar claims that circulated online in 2019, but Harris\u2019 new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge. Fact-checking organizations have continued debunking the claim after it reappeared."}

But states would still be responsible for administering elections.\nWhat\u2019s more, this is far from the first time Congress has considered measures to make the voting process more uniform.\nWe rate this claim False.","full_article":"Congress is fighting once again over the best way to provide relief to Americans as the coronavirus continues to infect people across the country and clobber the economy.\nHouse Democrats passed a $2.2 trillion relief package on Oct. 1, 2020, that would provide another round of enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, as well as support for schools and businesses.\nThe vote came amid frayed talks with the White House and just hours before President Donald Trump announced he had tested positive for COVID-19. (Trump has since called the talks off, then suggested he wanted to continue negotiations)\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, who voted against the House stimulus package, characterized the legislation in an Oct. 4, 2020, newsletter as a \"partisan spending bill\" and pointed to several provisions he deemed \"egregious.\"\nOne of them: The bill, he said, \"strips states of their right to administer elections.\"\nIs Grothman right?\nWhat the bill says\nWhen asked for evidence to support Grothman\u2019s claim, a spokesman referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to several provisions in the bill related to elections.\nAmong them:\nStates would be required to create contingency plans for federal elections in the event of an emergency or natural disaster and update that plan at least every five years. States that don\u2019t meet those requirements could face civil action from the attorney general.\n\n\nStates must provide early voting at least 15 days before an election and allow voting to occur at least 10 hours each day.\n\n\nThey would not be permitted to require identification to obtain an absentee ballot or require a witness signature for an absentee ballot to be counted.\n\n\nElection officials would be required to accept ballots mailed on or before Election Day and received within 10 days after the election.\n\n\nStates that require voter identification at the polls would have to give voters the opportunity to provide a signed statement attesting to their identity.\nDemocrats first introduced these requirements, dubbed the American Coronavirus\/COVID-19 Election Safety and Security Act, as part of the HEROES Act they unsuccessfully pushed earlier this year.\n\"I\u2019d also like to add that states may already have some of these same procedures in place,\" Grothman spokesman Timothy Svoboda said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"However, that does not change the fact that the authority would now be at the federal level.\"\nBarry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he thinks under the measure states could tailor the rules to their own needs, but noted the bill is a \"pretty substantial involvement of the federal government.\"\n\"In some other states, it would require a significant change of their laws,\" he said\nThat said, the measure doesn\u2019t tackle some key aspects of the voting system, such as residency requirements or who can work at the polls.\nAnd the measure would only apply to federal elections, which occur in November every two years. States could still create their own rules for local elections.\nThe rights of states\nWho\u2019s really in charge of elections, anyway?\nThe U.S. Constitution says state legislatures can prescribe the \"times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,\" but goes on to give Congress the ability to make or alter such rules. According to an analysis of the clause, Congress\u2019 primary duty is to uphold the integrity of the election process and right to vote.\n\"States, territories, and the District of Columbia have primary responsibility for administering elections in the United States, but Congress retains authority over the time, place, and manner of federal elections,\" states a July 16, 2020 memo from the Congressional Research Service.\nThe memo goes on to say that Congress could consider expanded mail voting requirements in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but noted that \"states, territories, and the District of Columbia \u2026 might reject new federal requirements as an infringement on their authority to conduct elections or new funding that comes attached to such requirements.\"\nBurden said Congress has taken a larger role in federal elections over time, often to provide a more uniform voting experience and protect vulnerable groups.\nThe Help America Vote Act, for example, created mandates for voting equipment and required states to implement a computerized voter registration list, among other provisions.\nStill, Burden said, \"states will always run their elections.\"\nLet\u2019s return to Grothman\u2019s claim, that the measure \"strips states of their right to administer elections.\"\nMerriam-Webster defines \"administer\" as \"to manage or supervise the execution, use, or conduct of.\"\nNothing about the House-passed legislation takes away the ability of states to administer elections. Grothman may oppose the proposed requirements, but suggesting states will lose that right and responsibility is simply not accurate."}

Clinton\u2019s answer was longer and more nuanced.\nDuring a January 2013 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Johnson did repeatedly press Clinton about not making contact with Americans in Benghazi to \"ascertain immediately that there was no protest.\" Clinton did give her exasperated answer (which has been hashtagged and criticized).\n\"Ron's questioning from start to finish was about how a simple phone call could have led to the truth \u2014 a fact that clearly got under Secretary Clinton's skin just as he described,\" Brian Reisinger, Johnson\u2019s spokesman, told us.\nBut Johnson\u2019s account requires some more context, as Clinton answered the senator\u2019s question twice before her infamous comment.\nHere is a transcript of their exchange, per PolitiFact Wisconsin, with the parts Johnson highlighted in bold:\nJohnson: \"Okay, when you read the ARB (State Department Accountability Review Board), it strikes me as how certain the people were that the attacks started at 9:40 Benghazi time. When was the first time you spoke to \u2014 or have you ever spoken to \u2014 the returnees, the evacuees? Did you personally speak to those folks?\"\nClinton: \"I\u2018ve spoken to one of them, but I waited until after the ARB had done its investigation because I did not want there to be anybody raising any issue that I had spoken to anyone before the ARB conducted its investigation.\"\nJohnson: \"How many people were evacuated from Libya?\"\nClinton: \"Well, the numbers are a little bit hard to pin down because of our other friends \u2014 \"\nJohnson: \"Approximately?\"\nClinton: \"Approximately, 25 to 30.\"\nJohnson: \"Did anybody in the State Department talk to those folks very shortly afterwards?\"\nClinton: \"There was discussion going on afterwards, but once the investigation started, the FBI spoke to them before we spoke to them, and so other than our people in Tripoli \u2014 which, I think you\u2019re talking about Washington, right?\"\nJohnson: \"The point I\u2019m making is, a very simple phone call to these individuals, I think, would\u2019ve ascertained immediately that there was no protest prior to this. This attack started at 9:40 p.m. Benghazi time, and it was an assault. I appreciate the fact that you called it an assault. But I\u2019m going back to then-Ambassador (Susan) Rice five days later going on the Sunday shows and, what I would say, is purposefully misleading the American public. Why wasn\u2019t that known? And again, I appreciate the fact that the transparency of this hearing, but why weren\u2019t we transparent to that point in time?\"\nClinton: \"Well, first of all, senator, I would say that once the assault happened, and once we got our people rescued and out, our most immediate concern was, number one, taking care of their injuries. As I said, I still have a DS (Diplomatic Security) agent at Walter Reed seriously injured \u2014 getting them into Frankfurt, Ramstein to get taken care of, the FBI going over immediately to start talking to them. We did not think it was appropriate for us to talk to them before the FBI conducted their interviews. And we did not \u2014 I think this is accurate, sir \u2014 I certainly did not know of any reports that contradicted the IC (Intelligence Community) talking points at the time that Ambassador Rice went on the TV shows. And you know I just want to say that people have accused Ambassador Rice and the administration of misleading Americans. I can say trying to be in the middle of this and understanding what was going on, nothing could be further from the truth. Was information developing? Was the situation fluid? Would we reach conclusions later that weren\u2019t reached initially? And I appreciate the \u2014 \"\nJohnson: \"But, Madame Secretary, do you disagree with me that a simple phone call to those evacuees to determine what happened wouldn\u2019t have ascertained immediately that there was no protest? That was a piece of information that could have been easily, easily obtained?\"\nClinton: \"But, senator, again \u2014 \"\nJohnson: \"Within hours, if not days?\"\nClinton: \"Senator, you know, when you\u2019re in these positions, the last thing you want to do is interfere with any other process going on, number one \u2014 \"\nJohnson: \"I realize that\u2019s a good excuse.\"\nClinton: \"Well, no, it\u2019s the fact. Number two, I would recommend highly you read both what the ARB said about it and the classified ARB because, even today, there are questions being raised. Now, we have no doubt they were terrorists, they were militants, they attacked us, they killed our people. But what was going on and why they were doing what they were doing is still unknown \u2014\"\nJohnson: \"No, again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that \u2014 an assault sprang out of that \u2014 and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact, and the American people could have known that within days and they didn\u2019t know that.\"\nClinton: \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they\u2019d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The IC has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we\u2019ll figure out what was going on in the meantime.\"\nJohnson: \"Okay. Thank you, Madame Secretary.\"\nSo the transcript makes a few points fairly clear:\nJohnson was the guy who got Clinton riled up by asking why she didn\u2019t call Benghazi survivors;\n\n\nClinton did say \"What difference at this point does it make?\" in response to that question.\n\n\nBut Clinton also did provide Johnson other answers. She said her priority was figuring out how to rescue those still at the compound and how to treat their injuries, not pressing them for information. She said it wasn\u2019t appropriate for the State Department to talk to them before FBI interviews. Finally, she said her department and the administration were still trying to sort out the confusion in the days following the attacks."}

And to stay here?\nThe evidence\nWhen asked for backup for the claim, Johnson\u2019s staff pointed to a variety of situations and scenarios, including legal precedents (the 1997 Flores settlement); the Homeland Security Act; and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\nAn email from Johnson\u2019s office also pointed to the issues of unaccompanied minors, immigration court capacity and hearings on border security, as well as \"credible fear\" claims.\nLet\u2019s sort this out.\nIt\u2019s important to note Johnson\u2019s claim focuses on those seeking asylum status. That is different than those who may seek to enter the country as refugees or other immigration channels.\nFor example, the difference between asylees and refugees is procedural, according to AllLaw.com, a website that includes links to legal information, forms, and news. A person who requests asylum in the United States is called an asylee. A person who requests protection while still overseas, and then is given permission to enter the U.S., is called a refugee.\nAn asylee, or a person granted asylum, is authorized to work in the United States, can apply for a Social Security card, can request permission to travel overseas and can petition to bring family members to the United States. Asylees may also be eligible for federal or Office of Refugee Resettlement benefits, such as Medicaid or Refugee Medical Assistance.\nAfter one year, an asylee may apply for permanent resident status (i.e., a green card). Once the individual becomes a permanent resident, he or she must wait four years to apply for citizenship.\nTestimony from border patrol agents and federal officials at Senate Homeland Security Committee hearings has included first-hand testimony from border agents and federal officials on the migrants presenting themselves at the border, citing fear of being accosted, forced into or killed by Central American gangs.\nOthers have claimed they cannot return to their country of origin because of fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a political social group, or political opinion.\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website details a variety of guidelines on how to proceed when migrants arrive at the border seeking asylum, including details on the definition for \"credible fear of persecution or torture\":\nQ. \u00a0\u00a0What is a Credible Fear of Persecution?\nA. \u00a0\u00a0A \"significant possibility\" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to your country.\nQ. \u00a0\u00a0What Is a Credible Fear of Torture?\nA. \u00a0\u00a0A \"significant possibility\" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country.\nAsylum denials\nContrary to what Johnson\u2019s claim suggests, denials of asylum by immigration judges have been rising.\nAs of the end of September 2016, overall asylum denial rates for fiscal year 2016 had risen to 57 percent. The total number of asylum denials from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2016 was 125,066, or 49.8 percent, according to Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse TracImmigration.\nAmong the number of Immigration Court asylum cases decided during fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2016, Mexico had the highest number of denials, with 12,028, or 89.6 percent. Others with high rates of denials include El Salvador with 11,546, or 82.9 percent; Honduras with 7,350, or 80.3 percent; Haiti with 1,599, or 80.1 percent; and the Dominican Republic, with 407 denials, or 87 percent.\nA 2017 analysis by Reuters illustrated that the difference between an asylum seeker being granted residency or ordered deported depends largely on which judge hears the case, and where.\nSyracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TracImmigration), confirmed that report.\nThe median level of asylum decision disparity that asylum seekers face is now over 56 percentage points. That is, the assignment of the judge for the typical asylum seeker could alter the odds of receiving asylum by this magnitude. For example, while the specific ranges differed by court, the typical asylum seeker might have only a 15 percent chance of being granted asylum all the way up to a 71 percent chance depending on the particular judge to whom their case is assigned.\nIn addition, Johnson\u2019s argument that \"we don\u2019t send them back\" comes with a major caveat. Under international law, the United States can\u2019t simply \"send them back,\" according to a Yale Law School report:\nSummary removal procedures put the United States at risk of violating the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids states from forcibly repatriating individuals who have legitimate claims for international protection. To satisfy its obligations under the Refugee Convention, the United States must provide arriving noncitizens a genuine opportunity to pursue asylum claims prior to their removal.\nA Trump directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the United States and promptly deporting those whose claims are rejected.\nUnaccompanied minors\nThings work somewhat differently when children -- \"unaccompanied minors,\" in immigration parlance -- arrive at the border themselves.\nThose procedures are covered by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\nIn those cases, the children are screened and may be placed in the care of a sponsor \u2013 usually a parent, relative, or family friend \u2013 who can care for them while their immigration cases proceed.\nIf the child fails to show up for a hearing, he or she can be ordered deported. However, deporting unaccompanied minors who are no shows in court is no easy task, because some do not stay at the addresses provided to the government and disappear into the general population.\nExpert opinion\nWe also turned to Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, who made it clear it\u2019s not as simple as saying the right words and being allowed to stay.\n\"If they pass the credible fear interview, they will be placed in removal proceedings and have an opportunity to apply for asylum in immigration court. If their case is denied, they will be deported,\" he said. \"In some cases, (authorities) may choose to parole the person into the country instead of keeping him or her detained, but that is very much the exception, not the rule.\""}

The declines toward the end of his tenure came as the city faced public criticism over the policy and a lawsuit that questioned the legality of the police behavior and its impact on minorities. So while there was ultimately a sharp decline, Bloomberg had presided over a sharp increase in stop and frisks for most of his time as mayor.\nBloomberg\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.","full_article":"Mike Bloomberg\u2019s first appearance in a Democratic presidential debate involved him fending off attacks on his record on the stop-and-frisk policy in New York. The former mayor said too many people were stopped and that he\u2019s apologized for it, but he also claimed that stops were cut back drastically once he learned about it.\n\"What happened, however, was it got out of control,\" Bloomberg said Feb. 19 in Las Vegas. \"And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out.\"\nStop and frisk didn\u2019t start with Bloomberg, but it did grow significantly under his tenure as mayor from 2002 to 2013. The practice allowed police to stop, question and frisk any person they believed was involved in criminal activity or in possession of a weapon. Data shows that police disproportionately targeted African Americans and Latinos. A federal judge in 2013 ruled that the New York Police Department\u2019s stop-and-frisk tactics violated the constitutional rights of minorities in the city.\nIs it true that stop and frisks dropped 95% during Bloomberg\u2019s tenure?\nThere\u2019s a way to calculate such a reduction. But it\u2019s just one snapshot of the mayor\u2019s 12 years in office. Another snapshot shows stop and frisks rose 600%. The decline during Bloomberg\u2019s later years as mayor came amid a public outcry about the policy and an impending lawsuit challenging the police department\u2019s tactics in carrying it out.\nRELATED: Mike Bloomberg\u2019s record on stop and frisk\nHis campaign said his claim relied on data for the first quarter of 2012 and the last quarter of 2013.\nFrom January to March 2012, the New York Police Department recorded 203,500 stops, compared with approximately 12,500 stops from October to December 2013. That\u2019s close to a 95% drop.\nWhat happened in the years before that while Bloomberg was still mayor?\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union compiled data using NYPD\u2019s annual reports and found that, in Bloomberg\u2019s first 10 years in office, stop and frisk numbers increased significantly. In 2002, there were 97,296 stops recorded \u2014 that increased more than 600% by 2011, when there were nearly 686,000 stops. Stops fell dramatically in 2013 to just under 192,000.\nBloomberg consistently supported the stop-and-frisk policy during his time in office and defended it\u00a0 for years after.\nIn May 2012, Bloomberg dismissed critics of the practice as a vocal minority.\nIn August 2013, after a federal judge ruled that the NYPD engaged in unconstitutional behavior under the policy, Bloomberg claimed the judge \"ignored the real-world realities of crime\" and that the city did not get a fair trial. \"You\u2019re not going to see any change in tactics overnight,\" he told the New York Times.\nIn July 2013, Bloomberg told the New Yorker: \"I would suggest to the next mayor, whoever it is, that saving lives is the most important thing, more so than pandering. Stop-and-frisk has been shown to be\u2014not the only, but the most effective tool in getting guns out of the hands of kids.\"\nBloomberg publicly apologized for the policy for the first time a week before launching his presidential campaign in November 2019."}

Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease, and the CDC gives this exact timeframe on its website.\nWe rate her claim True.","full_article":"The paid medical experts of TV channels are seeing a lot of time on the airwaves lately as they diagnose the country\u2019s measles flare-up.\nIt wasn\u2019t too long ago that they were explaining risks of the Ebola virus killing thousands of Western Africans and the chances it could spread throughout the United States. This time around, the health pundits have spent considerable time spelling out the differences between the two scary diseases.\nEbola, which has a low risk of spreading through the United States, is passed through direct contact with bodily fluids and not through the air.\nMeasles, which was eliminated from the United States in 2000 due to wide vaccination, is a very different virus, explained CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Unlike Ebola, \"you don\u2019t need to be that close to someone or kiss someone or anything like that\" to pass it around.\n\"It\u2019s airborne,\" she told Anderson Cooper on Feb. 2. \"If someone is in a room that has measles and leaves and you walk in two hours later, you could get measles from that person.\"\nWe thought her example sounded alarming. So, after checking our personal immunization histories, we decided to fact-check her statement.\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from Cohen when we reached out to CNN, but we found information from a reliable source that backs up her scenario.\nHer example is nearly exactly the transmission description for measles from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe measles virus stays in the nose and throat mucus of someone who has the infection, so it makes sense that it is passed around through coughing and sneezing.\n\"Also, measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed,\" the CDC says. \"If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.\"\nPhysicians encourage the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine because it is very effective in preventing the virus from entering the body (and as we found, the\u00a0science is certain\u00a0that it is safe).\nThe disease is so easy to catch, the CDC says, that if one person catches it, a whopping 90 percent of people who are not immune (i.e. did not have the vaccine due to a weak immune system, age or personal choice) close to the infected person will also become infected.\nWe can compare the contagion of each disease by examining the basic reproductive number, known as the R0. This refers to the average number of secondary infection cases stemming from one infected person in a \"completely susceptible\" uninfected population (if the population is vaccinated for, say, measles, the R0 basically disappears). As the R0 increases above 1, the disease spreads more widely.\nThe R0 of Ebola is around 2, meaning an average of two people catch the disease from one infected person during an outbreak. The measles has a much higher R0 of 18, higher than AIDS (R0 of 4), SARS (R0 of 4), or mumps (R0 of 10). NPR\u2019s Shots blog has a great chart breaking down this concept.\nPut another way, \"Ebola's got nothing\" on the measles epidemic, wrote Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center, in a recent Houston Chronicle opinion-editorial.\n\"Just being in the room where someone with measles has been 30 minutes earlier can expose you,\" Troisi wrote.\nTroisi confirmed the accuracy of Cohen\u2019s statement. When we asked about the discrepancy between her 30-minute window and Cohen\u2019s two-hour window, she directed us to the CDC\u2019s website and called her estimate \"conservative.\""}

And then the federal agency is barred from fashioning them into a database.\nWhat\u2019s more, there is no evidence such a requirement would violate the Second Amendment, since several states have gun registries that have not been struck down by the courts \u2014 and a similar provision was upheld by federal courts in a Washington, D.C. case.\nWe define Mostly False as \"a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" That fits here.","full_article":"Editor's Note: This item was updated to clarify that firearms dealers are required to fill out and reatain ATF Form 4473 for all types of gun purchases.\nGun control is a contentious topic in Wisconsin\u2019s divided government, with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers planning to force the issue by calling the Republican-controlled Legislature into a\u00a0special session.\nThe debate here and elsewhere typically centers on two types of legislation, both of which have been implemented in many other states:\nRed flag laws \u2014 These allow judges to temporarily remove firearms from people acting dangerously.\nUniversal background checks \u2014 These measures require background checks for sales by private parties, in addition to gun dealers, which are already required by federal law.\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald was asked to weigh in on the topic in a Sept. 22, 2019, appearance on WISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront.\" He said he didn\u2019t see any momentum for red flag laws, then pivoted, unprompted, to the other gun control flashpoint.\n\"Universal background checks, too,\" said the Juneau Republican, who recently announced he is running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"I mean, any time you\u2019re going to ask somebody to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official, it\u2019s going to violate the Second Amendment.\"\nThis raises some questions worth examining. People can disagree on whether universal background checks are a good idea (polling shows most Wisconsinites think so), but we should at least be able to agree on what they are.\nSo, do background checks really involve submitting serial numbers to the government?\nAnd would that violate the Second Amendment?\nHow background checks work\nFitzgerald\u2019s office did not reply to our requests for evidence of his claim and more details on his position.\nBut his response in the TV interview suggests universal background checks are tantamount to a gun registry \u2014 where the government keeps a record of which guns each person owns. It\u2019s a common argument from opponents of universal background checks, who see it as a step toward confiscation.\nBut it\u2019s an over-simplification of a nuanced issue.\nThere\u2019s no, well, universal version of universal background checks, but the basic concept is that private sellers are subject to the same general requirements as licensed gun dealers, including background checks on the would-be purchaser and keeping records of the sale.\nWisconsin is one of 29 states that currently do not require background checks or record-keeping on private gun sales. At the federal level, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives does not regulate private sales as it does those involving licensed firearm dealers.\nSome states \u2014 including California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2014 require all private sales be conducted through firearm dealers, who then retain sales records, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. They call that the \"most comprehensive policy option.\"\nOther states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement.\nRELATED:\u00a0Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order?\nIn Wisconsin, any universal background check would have to be integrated with the current system for gun dealer sales, which splits background check responsibilities based on the type of gun.\nThe state Department of Justice handles background checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through the National Criminal Background Check Systems, run by the FBI.\nWhat information is submitted to the government\nFitzgerald says he objects to universal background checks because of the new requirements they would place on private gun sales, so let\u2019s examine how those could look.\nIf Wisconsin implemented a comprehensive universal background check system, routing all sales through dealers, the flow of information to authorities would be the same as it is now for dealer sales.\nFor long gun sales, dealers fill out\u00a0ATF form 4473 \u2014 which includes the gun make and serial number \u2014 and submit it to the FBI\u2019s criminal background system. The FBI conducts the background check but is required by federal law to destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours.\nThe dealer is then required to keep a copy of the 4473 form for at least 20 years. After that point, or if the dealer goes out of business, the form is turned over to the ATF. But federal law forbids the ATF from storing these records in a searchable format or otherwise using them \"to establish any system for the registration of firearms.\" The records are retained using decades-old microfilm technology, making gun tracing a painstaking, manual process.\nFor handguns, Wisconsin dealers still fill out and retain the form 4473, but background checks are done by the Wisconsin Department of Justice.\u00a0State law requires dealers to submit the name, date of birth, gender, Social Security number and other identifying information to the Wisconsin DOJ. But the agency does not receive or store serial numbers or any other firearm information, said spokeswoman Gillian Drummond.\nSo under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would \u2014 eventually \u2014 make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database.\nIf Wisconsin opted for a less comprehensive system, less information would go to the government. For example, if the state DOJ were tasked with all background checks for private sales and private sellers were required to maintain their own records (as in Illinois), no serial numbers would be submitted to any government entity for any private gun sales.\nWould a gun registry violate the Second Amendment?\nAll of this brings us to the last element of Fitzgerald\u2019s claim \u2014 that submitting serial numbers to government officials violates the Second Amendment.\nCourts have said that isn\u2019t true.\nSix states and the District of Columbia already require registration of some or all firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\"These state laws have been in place for decades and have not been overturned on the grounds that they violate an individual\u2019s Second Amendment rights,\" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. \"Nothing in any Supreme Court ruling to date would suggest that a government requirement that gun owners provide serial numbers for the guns they purchase or own to government officials violates the Second Amendment.\"\nFor example, a challenge to the Washington, D.C. registration requirement in 2015 was largely upheld by a federal appeals court. The ruling stripped away some elements of the law but left untouched the basic requirement that guns be registered."}

In other words, did the funding in each area keep pace with inflation during Brown\u2019s tenure?\nFor youth services, the Walton campaign\u2019s analysis shows a 20 percent decrease in funding between 2017-18, the fiscal year when funding was highest - and 2021-22.\nBut from Brown\u2019s first budget in 2006-07 to 2021-22, inflation-adjusted funding for youth services increased by 122 percent. The funding did not steadily increase throughout Brown\u2019s tenure. As Walton\u2019s campaign points out, the highest funding year was in 2017-18, and it has decreased by $678,492 since then.\nFor senior services, the Walton campaign says that funding decreased by 16 percent between the highest year total and now, when budget figures are adjusted for inflation.\nBut using the inflation-adjusted data from the Walton campaign, spending on senior services increased by 21 percent between Brown\u2019s first budget and his 2021-22 budget. Spending in this category fluctuated over time, and the year with the highest appropriations in this category was in 2020-21.\nFor community centers, funding is difficult to discern for various reasons, Myerson said. But Myerson said some funding flows through the city\u2019s parks and recreation facilities and activities budget, and in 2021-22, appropriations in this category are 6 percent less than they were in 2017-18, when funding was highest.\nThe parks and recreation budget remains higher in 2021-22 than in 2010-11, after the city took back control of city parks from Erie County.\nCity responds\nThe Brown administration said that since Brown took office, funding for community centers, pools, rinks, splash pads and senior and youth service programming has increased by millions of dollars.\nFunding has not decreased in the city budget for two indoor pools and six youth-focused community centers, said Donna Estrich, commissioner of administration, finance, policy and urban affairs. Covid-19 closed facilities last year - not lack of funding.\nThe city did cut funding for outdoor pools, Estrich said, because the city anticipated that regular operations would not be feasible, both because of Covid-19 safety concerns and a national lifeguard shortage. The city reopened its indoor pools at varying capacities beginning in May, but has had trouble staffing them, despite a pay rate of $15 an hour, she said.\nIn July, well before their Sept. 9 debate, Brown proposed spending $20 million in American Rescue Plan stimulus funds for the renovation of four community centers. The Common Council approved the stimulus plan Aug. 26."}

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., bristled when NBC host Chuck Todd suggested Cotton\u2019s foreign policy positions align more closely with Clinton than with Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump.\n\"I can assure you that I am not very close to Hillary Clinton,\" Cotton responded. \"She has been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration. She was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia.\"\nCotton\u2019s list of her failings continued, but his comment about Russia invading Georgia caught our eye, and we decided to look a little closer.\nRussia and Georgia\nCotton\u2019s claim focuses on the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the semi-autonomous regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nTensions and violence between ethnic Georgians, South Ossetians and Abkhazians ebbed and flowed after the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1990. Under the USSR, South Ossetia and Abkhazia enjoyed substantial autonomy. Newly independent Georgian nationalists declared a unified nation with no internal borders.\nIn 1991, Georgian forces occupied the South Ossetian capital, but resistance by Russian-backed fighters led to a stalemate. In 1992, all parties agreed to a ceasefire, which included a Russian-led peacekeeping force. There was a similar pattern of hostilities in Abkhazia that resulted in a similar solution. The presence of peacekeepers and international monitors worked for about a decade.\nCalm unravelled in 2004 with the election of a more nationalist leader in Georgia. There was aggression on both sides. Violence grew and on Aug. 7, 2008, after Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia shelled ethnically Georgian villages, and the Georgian government sent in its army to take control of the region. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\nClashes continued for a week, drawing in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Open conflict ended on Aug. 12, 2008. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step.\nRussian troops largely withdrew from Georgian soil, although some forces remained in several Georgian cities until about October 2008.\nThe reset\nJump forward to March 2009 to pick up the other point in Cotton\u2019s statement.\nNewly elected President Barack Obama had campaigned that he would put relations with Russia on a less confrontational footing. Most of his focus was on scaling back the nuclear arsenals of both nations. (He promised to win Russian agreement to continue the monitoring and verification rules under the START I Treaty that were due to expire in 2009.)\nAs part of that initiative, on March 6, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a red button. The button was supposed to have word \"reset\" written on it in Russian. But the Americans got it wrong --\u00a0the word translated to \"overcharged.\"\nCounting the months\nSo Cotton has the basics of the story largely correct,\u00a0though he\u2019s cutting off the edges.\nRussian troops did participate in military activities on Georgian soil, but troops were already in place as part of a brokered peace settlement. And the Russians didn\u2019t necessarily initiate hostilities.\nAnd while Cotton said the Americans hit the \"reset\" button \"a few months\" after the Russian invasion, the reality is it took place almost six months after the week-long conflict had ended.\nAn invasion with a twist\nSusan Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice\u00a0at George Mason University, calls Russia\u2019s action an invasion because in early August 2008, Russia didn't\u00a0consider\u00a0South Ossetia to be an independent country.\nBut Allen told us that beyond that legal definition, the details muddy the picture. Georgia made the first large military move. On top of that, Russian soldiers were already on the ground in South Ossetia.\n\"Russia had had a longstanding role as part of a peacekeeping force separating the Georgians and South Ossetians,\" Allen said. \"Yes, Russia invaded Georgia, and, yes, there is a lot more to the story.\"\nLaw professor Kenneth Anderson at American University put a lot of weight on the rest of the story. Right after the ceasefire, Anderson urged western powers to push back hard against Russian expansionism. But he reminded people of the ethnic cleansing that took place at the hands of Georgian nationalists in the 1990s, saying it was as extreme as anything he had seen in the war in the former Yugoslavia.\n\"The facts of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not simply a narrative of Russia stirring up trouble in an otherwise untroubled corner of the world,\" Anderson wrote in a 2008 article. \"This conflict got started 15 years ago, and although on again and off again, it has never stopped. \u00a0Neither its existence nor its persistence are due to Russian imperial expansion alone.\"\nFor Cotton to bring up Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia might invoke more recent memories of Russia\u2019s clear aggression in Ukraine when it seized control of the Crimean peninsula. But the circumstances were quite different, as was the western reaction. The Crimean seizure produced hard sanctions against Russia, including expulsion from the G-8. In contrast, in 2008, the George W. Bush administration made only cautious moves to register its disapproval of Russia.\nDavid L. Phillips, director of Columbia University\u2019s program on peace-building and rights, told PolitFact in 2014 that \"there was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that.\"\nRegarding the impact of the \"reset\", some observers say it helped. Political scientist\u00a0Andrew Kuchins at the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in 2011 that relations between Russia and America \"steadily improved.\" Kuchins credits the diplomatic shift with producing a new START treaty and winning Russian support for stronger sanctions against Iran."}

Vukmir\u2019s letter to the judge in Kramer\u2019s case is limited to Kramer\u2019s character. It doesn\u2019t go as far as some letters in such cases that explicitly ask for leniency or lighter treatment, such as probation rather than jail.\nBut while the word leniency might mean different things to different people, it\u2019s clear that Vukmir\u2019s letter was written to benefit Kramer \u2014 in other words, seeking a lighter sentence, rather than a harsher one.\nWe rate Club for Growth\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nEditor's note: This item was corrected on July 18, 2018, after it was first published, to clarify the Club for Growth entities.","full_article":"The national anti-tax group Club for Growth, whose\u00a0political action committee\u00a0is backing conservatives in seven U.S. Senate and House races around the country, released a TV ad through one of its affiliates\u00a0that attacks Leah Vukmir.\nThe ad, produced by CFG Action Wisconsin and released July 12, 2018,\u00a0makes a series of claims against the Wisconsin Republican, starting with this one:\n\"Vukmir wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault.\"\nAs we\u2019ll see, Vukmir did write a letter that was clearly in support of the lawmaker.\nThe case\nVukmir, a suburban Milwaukee state senator, and political newcomer Kevin Nicholson, who is endorsed by Club for Growth, are running in the GOP primary on Aug. 14, 2018. The winner will face Democrat Tammy Baldwin on Nov. 6, 2018.\nThe TV ad footnotes a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article that revealed the existence of Vukmir\u2019s letter. The letter was sent on behalf of then-Rep. Bill Kramer of the Town of Waukesha, the onetime Republican leader of the state Assembly.\nAccording to the December 2017 article, which cited court records as a source:\nVukmir wrote a brief character reference letter for Kramer in 2014, a month after Kramer pleaded no contest to two counts of fourth-degree sexual assault, both misdemeanors, in a plea bargain. He originally was charged with two felonies.\nThe letter was sent to the judge in Waukesha County, in suburban Milwaukee, just before the judge sentenced Kramer to three years of probation that included five months in jail with work-release privileges.\nThe conviction stemmed from a 2011 incident outside a Republican Party event at a tavern. The victim told the court she feared Kramer might rape her after she resisted his advances, which included shoving her against a car, forcibly kissing her, putting his hands up her shirt and grabbing her groin.\nThe victim did not report it at the time, but came forward after Kramer allegedly groped a legislative aide\u2019s breasts and bragged about his sexual prowess to a female lobbyist at a 2014 fundraiser in Washington, D.C.\nThe letter\nHere\u2019s what Vukmir\u2019s letter said:\nI have known Bill Kramer for over 12 years and consider him a friend. I have known Bill when he was drinking and I have known Bill when he was not drinking.\nBy the time of his sentencing, Bill will have been sober for 270 days. Being sober has had a profound impact on Bill for the better. I also think it is important to recognize that Bill became sober under his own volition. Bill became sober to improve his life, not because he was sent to a court-mandated program.\nI believe this change has improved Bill\u2019s life considerably.\nAnalysis\nClub for Growth spokesman Bob Pipkin defended the group\u2019s claim by referring us to an article about the disclosure of Vukmir\u2019s letter in the Wisconsin Gazette, which describes itself as a progressive, alternative newspaper.\n\"We took the interpretation of a liberal Wisconsin newspaper; they interpreted it as leniency,\" he told us.\nA caption to a photo with the article says Vukmir sought leniency, although the headline and the first sentence of the article merely said Vukmir sent a letter supporting Kramer.\nMattias Gugel, a Vukmir campaign spokesman, told us: \"The accusation that Leah wrote a letter asking for leniency is a blatant lie. She simply spoke about a colleague seeking help for addiction issues.\"\nBut it\u2019s not as though Vukmir\u2019s letter would have been seen by the judge as urging a harsher sentence for Kramer rather than a lighter one.\nWe also sought views from two lawyers based in Waukesha County, where Kramer is from and where the crime occurred.\nCriminal defense lawyer Jerome Buting, known for his work on the case made famous by the film \"Making a Murderer,\" said Vukmir\u2019s letter does seek leniency:\nIf you write a letter on behalf of a defendant at sentencing, most of the time I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that\u2019s seeking leniency, whether it\u2019s expressed that way or not. You're trying to convey to the judge that this one incident doesn\u2019t necessarily portray everything about his (the defendant\u2019s) character, and that is one of the big factors the court has to consider in sentencing.\nPaul Bucher, who does criminal defense work and is the former district attorney in Waukesha County, disagreed, saying some letters explicitly ask for leniency or no jail time and Vukmir\u2019s doesn't:\nWe do character letters all the time because all the court really knows about the client is what is in the criminal complaint. So, the job of a defense \u00a0lawyer is to give the judge a broader picture of who is standing in front of him. (Vukmir\u2019s letter is) a pretty standard, boilerplate, character letter.\nBut even if it doesn\u2019t go far as some, Vukmir\u2019s letter clearly was written to help Kramer."}

Israel\u2019s data from January and July shows the differences in risk for an unvaccinated and vaccinated population.\nIn January, when the country\u2019s vaccine campaign was still in its early stages and infections were peaking, there were 1,100 patients in serious condition.

The U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-appointed justices, rejected Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s challenge to election results in four states.\nJudge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, said in dismissing one Pennsylvania challenge: \"Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.\""}

In a recent tweet, the Republican National Committee blamed rising crime on Democrats.\n\"Crime is escalating to a level we haven\u2019t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\u2019 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies,\" Republicans tweeted June 29.\nWe asked the RNC for the data behind the claims in the tweet. Their response included nothing on the link to police defunding. On the open border part, they pointed to news coverage about an increase in fentanyl seizures at the border, high-speed chases in South Texas, and FBI director Christopher Wray talking about an epidemic of drug smuggling and other illegal activity at the border.\nThe RNC tweet is rife with inaccuracies. But its biggest flaw is the unfounded assertion that crime rate trends were a \"direct result\" of Democratic policies.\nA few key errors\nHomicides increased in 2020. It\u2019s possible that the toll could have topped 19,000 last year.\nBut the RNC tweet is not narrowly about rising homicides. It encompasses several other claims that are flawed:\n\"Open-border policies\": The articles the RNC cited said nothing linking activity at the border to a spike in the national incidence of murders or other crimes. We found no independent research that argued that point.\nCriminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah noted that when murders began to increase rapidly in mid-2020, immigration was stable or declining.\n\"And, obviously, Democrats did not control immigration policy in May 2020,\" Cassell said. \"So any linkage between the 2020 homicide increase and immigration policies seems quite dubious.\"\nHistoric highs: The RNC tweet talked about crime reaching levels not seen in decades. Not only do they lack the data to confirm that, but based on the FBI\u2019s latest available data for homicides and other preliminary data, the U.S. is not on pace to reach the heights seen in the mid-1990s.\n\"Defund the police\":\u00a0The RNC tweet suggested that \"defund the police\" is a core Democratic policy. It is not. A handful of Democrats have spoken out for it, but during the 2020 campaign, candidate Joe Biden rejected the movement. And his 2022 budget requested an increase of $304 million for police to build ties within the communities they patrol.\nSome Democratic-led cities did cut police budgets last year, but not many. Among the 50 largest cities, police spending as a percentage of general expenditures went up an average of 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021.\nCrime trend: Homicides are up\nThe RNC tweet speaks of crime broadly, but it\u2019s homicides in particular that have caused alarm since a sharp rise in the summer of 2020. That coincided with the anti-police-violence protests that spread across the country in June following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The calls to defund the police gained prominence the same month.\nOne problem in talking about crime at this moment is that no one yet has a national picture of crime for 2020, let alone the first half of 2021. The FBI\u2019s annual Uniform Crime Report is the most comprehensive data set, and the FBI hasn\u2019t published the 2020 edition yet.\nOther data sets lack the scope of the FBI\u2019s full assessment, but they all point in the same direction: Homicides are up.\nA preliminary FBI crime report for 154 cities says murders rose 10% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. The Major Cities Chiefs Association found a 29% rise in homicides for 63 cities in the first quarter of 2021. And the latest report from Council on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, looked at 24 cities and found homicides rose by 24% in the first quarter.\nThe topline numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, however.\nFor example, in the first-quarter FBI release on 154 cities, the increase in homicides was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As for violent crime generally \u2014 including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault \u2014 the number remained just about the same across the full group of cities, undercutting the RNC\u2019s broad-brush claim about escalating crime.\nThe Council on Criminal Justice\u2019s data on weekly police reports found that homicide rates generally fell after October 2020 \u2014 from a bit over 5 deaths per 100,000 to about 3 per 100,000 by March 2021.\nThat could reflect seasonal changes; homicides tend to fall in the cooler months. But the report\u2019s authors say other unknown factors could be at work.\nNo cause and effect\nThe RNC\u2019s claim that rising crime was a \"direct result\" of Democratic policies lacks evidence, and experts say it ignores some of the major events of 2020 that also likely had an effect on crime.\n\"The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,\" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. \"Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.\"\nCriminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the economic downturn also mattered.\n\"Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,\" Ahlin said. \"Last year we saw both at play.\"\nOn top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the death of George Floyd.\nCassell at the University of Utah said that played a role, because it made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.\n\"Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,\" Cassell said.\nCassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect. Regardless, Cassell called the GOP link between crime and a defund policy \"dubious.\"\nEven the pandemic and the protests might not fully explain the trend in homicides. As the Council on Criminal Justice report noted, the \"homicide increase actually began in 2019, prior to the pandemic and well before protests against police violence spread across the country.\"\nLooking at the first three months of 2020, murders rose 20% from a year earlier. The pandemic shutdown didn\u2019t take place until mid-March, and the protests didn\u2019t begin until late May."}

But an ideological cross-section of economists agreed that the recession was primarily caused by a housing bubble that turned into a financial crisis, and that it was caused by many factors more significant than low taxes.\nSo for Clinton to say that tax cuts for the rich \"in large part\" caused the Great Recession is a significant exaggeration. We rate it Mostly False.","full_article":"During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton tried to fix blame for the Great Recession on a cherished part of conservative economic policy -- tax cuts.\n\"Trickle-down did not work,\" Clinton said, referring to a derisive name for tax cuts that dates from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. \"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn\u2019t worked.\"\nLater in the debate. Clinton doubled down on that argument, saying, \"Well, let\u2019s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\"\nWe had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton\u2019s argument held water.\nFirst, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton\u2019s assertion at the debate.\nMost, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Three Pinocchios out of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a 663-page report from 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.)\nThat said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign\u2019s arguments stand out as plausible:\n\u2022 Bush administration regulators took their eyes off Wall Street.\n\u2022 Bush\u2019s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back.\nWe found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton\u2019s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (The Post\u2019s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.)\n\"It\u2019s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression,\" and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn\u2019t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said.\nSo there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession.\nHowever, the \u00a0economists we checked with expressed skepticism -- some strongly so -- about Clinton\u2019s assertion that the recession emerged \"in large part\" due to tax policies.\nOn the left, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, said he wouldn\u2019t just call tax cuts a minor factor in causing the recession -- he said he \"can't think of any way they were a factor at all.\" If anything, he said, \"the conventional wisdom goes the other way -- tax cuts tend to increase the deficit, which pushes up interest rates and in turn drags down house prices.\"\nOn the right, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. \"Hillary is spouting nonsense,\" he said. \"No economic theory links tax cuts -- or, for that matter, tax increases -- to financial market meltdowns.\"\nOther economists we contacted echoed these sentiments.\n\"Clinton is on solid ground criticizing Bush\u2019s tax cuts, but blaming them for the recession goes too far,\" said Bruce Bartlett, a former Ronald Reagan aide who has sometimes broken with some conservative orthodoxies. \"One can certainly say that the Bush tax cuts failed to raise economic growth or lower unemployment to any significant degree, and one can argue that the Reagan tax cuts were not especially stimulative as well. But to argue that the Bush tax cuts caused the 2008-09 recession is a stretch.\"\nHarvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who was an official in the administrations of both Bush and his father, said that tax cuts seem like an unlikely culprit, because \"historically we\u2019ve had relatively low rates without terrible -- or any -- recessions.\" He added that low tax rates \"would not make my list of the top 10 reasons for the recession.\"\nInstead, Rosen pointed to a \"housing bubble in the United States and Europe that was fed by excess liquidity and poorly regulated mortgage markets.\" This became a problem, he said, when large financial institutions that had huge amounts of assets dependent on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed.\n\"After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the financial system collapsed,\" Rosen said. \"With the collapse in confidence came a collapse in credit markets -- no one was able to borrow -- which ultimately caused a contraction of the real economy.\"\nBrookings Institution economist Gary Burtless added another factor: the irrational psychologies of the bubble, on the part of both homebuyers and lenders who felt empowered to pursue risky arrangements in the absence of strict regulation. \"By the middle of the 2000-2010 decade, a great many loans were made that prudent lenders would not have made in the 1990s or ever the early 2000s,\" Burtless said.\nThis, in turn, led to the \"end of a housing boom, a sharp decline in housing prices, widespread mortgage defaults, widespread mortgage securities defaults, and a lack of assets to cover the losses at nine large financial institutions -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, the CitiCorp holding company, and the AIG holding company,\" said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business."}

As the report makes clear, it's the number of attempted transactions, some of which might have been done by the same individual.\nThe statement is accurate but it needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/47d79ce0-3137-4146-834d-1d858403e397","full_article":"The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., June 12 reopened the debate over who should access to guns, with Democrats calling for stricter controls.\nDuring a June 14 news conference in Washington, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said most people suspected of terrorism in the United States haven't haven't found it difficult to purchase a weapon.\n\"Last year, 244 people on the terror watch list tried to purchase guns; 244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm. Only 21 went empty-handed,\" Schumer said. \"Ninety-one percent of suspected terrorists, when they sought to purchase a gun, last year were successful, according to GAO.\"\nThe GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\nFirst, some background on these \"suspected terrorists.\"\nThe FBI's Terrorist Screening Center maintains a list of people \"known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity.\" This list is secret but it's believed to have around 700,000 names collected by U.S. and global agencies. It's estimated that 10,000 of those names are Americans and the rest are foreigners.\nWe looked at this issue in December when we examined U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy's tweet that \"91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted.\" We rated Murphy's statement\u00a0Mostly True.\n(Murphy, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016, issued the tweet after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns.)\nMurphy was referencing a GAO report from March 2015. But Schumer's statement focused on the entire year of 2015. So we found the updated report.\nIssued March 7, 2016, it found \u2014 as Schumer reported \u2014 that only 21 of the 244 transactions attempted by people on the terrorist watch list at a licensed firearms shop were blocked. In 223 cases, the customers got their weapons.\nBut there are important omissions in these numbers.\nSo we don't know that 244 people on the list attempted to buy guns. We know that people on the list attempted to buy guns 244 times.\nOn the flip side,\u00a0the number of people on the watch list who legally purchased weapons may be far higher because the tally doesn't include transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren\u2019t conducted.\nFinally, there have been questions about the accuracy of the watchlist itself.\nA 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were \"associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations\" and should have been removed from the list.\nThere also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which means people with the same name as a person on the watch list were stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved."}

An earlier version of this story described the statistic differently. This post was updated at 1 p.m. March 3, 2014.","full_article":"President Barack Obama has been vocal in his opposition to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine. Focus has shifted from the new government in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital, to Crimea, a region Russian troops seized control of Saturday.\nMeanwhile, politicians and pundits are divided over what the United States\u2019 role should be in the conflict. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius criticized Putin\u2019s actions on Face the Nation, saying Ukraine \"is not prepared to go backwards\" to a Russian regime. He then offered up some context about Crimea\u2019s history.\n\"Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954,\" he said. \"Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people.\"\nIgnatius was correct in saying that Ukraine has only controlled the Crimean Peninsula since 1954 -- a claim we also heard from U.S. Rep. Mike Roger, R-Mich., on Fox News Sunday. Not up on your Soviet history? We\u2019ll review the facts.\nCrimea is an eastern Ukrainian peninsula located on the Black Sea. It\u2019s connected to the rest of the country by a small strip of land. Out of its 2 million residents, about 60 percent identify as Russian. That\u2019s the highest concentration of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Although the territory belongs to Ukraine, Russia stations part of its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol as part of a pre-existing agreement between the two countries.\nAs Ignatius pointed out, Crimea hasn\u2019t always been part of Ukraine. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of what\u2019s happened in the region since the Ottoman Empire used the peninsula as a hub for slave trade.\n1783: Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n\n1853: The Crimean War began, lasting three years. Russia lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Crimea remained part of Russia.\n\n\n1917: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War.\n\n\n1921: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n1942: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram posts\n\n\nstated on September 26, 2022 in an Instagram post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are giant human caucasian skeletons in Ohio that predate any known civilizations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Madison Czopek \u2022 September 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1944: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members\u2019 alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II. Many returned to Crimea in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\n1945: After World War II, the autonomous Soviet republic was dissolved and Crimea became a province of the Soviet Union called the Crimean Oblast.\n\n\n1954: Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine. It\u2019s often reported that it was a gesture of goodwill from Khrushchev, who had Ukrainian roots.\n\n\n1991: The Soviet Union collapsed. Many expected President Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation, to take Crimea for Russia. But he didn\u2019t bring it up during negotiations with Ukraine.\n\n\n1997: Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that allowed Russia to keep its fleet in Sevastopol. The agreement\u2019s since been extended, so the fleet is set to remain there until at least 2042.\nAs for Ignatius\u2019 claim that Khrushchev\u2019s decision to give Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, we found literature to support that. Slate\u2019s Joshua Keating offered up possible reasons for the land transfer, including the 300th anniversary of Ukraine\u2019s merger with tsarist Russia and Khrushchev\u2019s ties to Ukraine.\nThough Khrushchev\u2019s gesture had unclear motives, it didn\u2019t seem like a problem for Russia at the time, only garnering a one-sentence write-up in the official Soviet newspaper. It became a bigger issue in the region once the Soviet Union collapsed decades later.\nSo the story of the Crimean Peninsula is long and complicated, to say the least.

Public confidence in H1N1 was the second highest, not \"one of the worst\" or the \"lowest.\"\nPolling done after the Gallup poll showed a decline in approval of Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak.\nTrump\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.","full_article":"President Donald Trump went on Twitter to applaud his administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus and shift attention to another pandemic that happened when Joe Biden was vice president.\nThe first U.S. case of a new H1N1 influenza virus (also called swine flu) was detected in April 2009, three months after the Obama administration began. The pandemic took a toll on Americans, with an estimated 60.8 million H1N1 cases and 12,469 deaths from April 2009 to April 2010.\nWorldwide, it\u2019s estimated the virus killed between 151,700 to 575,400 people during its first year. (By August 2010, the World Health Organization said the virus had largely run its course.)\nTrump said Biden, a top Democratic presidential candidate, led an ineffective effort to combat the outbreak.\n\"Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record.

How does his recent tweet line up with the facts?\nHe\u2019s wrong about Biden\u2019s role and omitted important context about his polling.\n\"Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people.\"\nBiden was the vice president, but he was not in charge of the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the H1N1 pandemic. That responsibility mainly fell on the leaders of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Trump enlisted Vice President Mike Pence to helm the country\u2019s response to COVID-19.)\nHealth policy experts told PolitiFact they did not recall Biden having a prominent leadership role. PolitiFact also reviewed archives of Obama\u2019s public statements on H1N1 and found that Obama generally mentioned the leadership of department heads and of his homeland security adviser, not Biden.\nRELATED FACT-CHECK: Trump wrongly blames Obama for limits on coronavirus testing\nAt the same time, Biden\u2019s website mentions the Obama administration's record to make the argument to voters that he could manage the current response better. Biden\u2019s coronavirus response plan says he \"helped lead\" the Obama administration\u2019s response to H1N1 in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014. It does not offer further detail.\nThe H1N1 response \"was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!\"\nNeither the White House nor Trump\u2019s campaign responded to our requests for information backing Trump\u2019s claim.\nIf Trump was talking about public confidence in the federal government\u2019s ability to handle outbreaks, he might have been referring to a Gallup poll taken Feb. 3-16. But he isn\u2019t correct about its findings and ignores key context.\nA lot has happened since Gallup asked a random sample of 1,028 adults how confident they were that the federal government would be able to handle a coronavirus outbreak. Trump\u2019s \"78% approval rating\" could be alluding to the combined 77% who were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%). The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.\nGallup in February said that the 77% figure showed a higher level of confidence than Gallup had found for previous health scares during other administrations.\nBut confidence in the 2009 H1N1 response was the second highest, not \"one of the worst on record.\" The averages of two polls in 2009 showed that 67% of respondents were very confident or somewhat confident in the federal government\u2019s ability to handle the H1N1 outbreak. Those two polls were released in May and August of that year, about a month and four months into the outbreak.\nPublic confidence in the federal government\u2019s handling of the Zika virus, Ebola virus, and bird flu were lower than for H1N1.\nGallup\u2019s February poll began days after the Trump administration announced restrictions on travelers who had been in China in the prior two weeks, and at that time, no one had died within the United States from the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\"This high level of confidence may be related to the fact that all deaths from COVID-19 have occurred abroad, rather than on U.S. soil,\" Gallup said in February.\nBy the time of Trump\u2019s March 12 tweet, there were more than 1,600 coronavirus cases in the United States and at least 41 deaths.\nPolling done after Gallup\u2019s shows a drop in confidence in the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. A Feb. 28-March 1 Morning Consult survey showed that 49% of voters approved of Trump\u2019s response to the outbreak, down from 56% in a Feb. 24-26 survey \u2014 a decline fueled by drops among independents and Democrats. The poll surveyed 1,997 registered voters and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points."}

It has paid to export Wahhabism and Wahhabism is an extreme form of Islam. But it\u2019s not clear that Wahhabism teaches that Americans are the devil.\nWe rate Feingold\u2019s statement Mostly True.","full_article":"Near the end of an hourlong interview at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Oct. 7, 2016, Russ Feingold was asked about his criticism of Saudi Arabia in the fight against international terrorism.\nThe Wisconsin Democrat, who is seeking to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, gave this answer:\n\"Here is a country that is a friend; at least an ally. A country that we have a good relationship with, that can help us in a lot of ways -- not just with oil, but in military situations such as what\u2019s going on in a number of places in the Middle East.\n\"Having said that, though, this regime has embraced Wahhabism. Wahhabism is an extreme form of Islam that they have paid to export throughout the world.\n\"This Wahhabism is the principle force -- going from Pakistan to Ethiopia to Mali and now to Kosovo -- that is turning perfectly moderate Muslim peoples, peace-loving peoples, into people who adopt an extreme religious approach where the women are all covered up and they are basically taught that Americans are the devil.\n\"How can we allow a country to be perceived as a friend -- across the board, without any questions -- when they are doing such a terrible thing?\"\nSo, has a U.S. ally \"paid to export throughout the world\" Wahhabism -- \"an extreme form of Islam\" that basically teaches \"Americans are the devil\"?\nSaudi is an ally\nAs Feingold intimated, Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally, even if the relationship is sometimes uneasy.\nSaudi Arabia has been a close ally in the Middle East since World War II, the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in April 2016, even as differences on issues such as Iran have strained the relationship.\nIn testimony before a congressional committee in May 2016, a Middle East scholar from the Brookings Institution led off by saying: \"On the one hand, the Saudi government is a close partner of the United States on counterterrorism. On the other hand, Saudi support for an array of preachers and non-government organizations contributes to an overall climate of radicalization, making it far harder to counter violent extremism.\"\nPolitico Magazine was more blunt. In 2014, it named Saudi Arabia No. 2 on its list of America\u2019s 25 most awkward allies, saying: \"No country buys more U.S. weapons than the autocratic, oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchy, and no country \u2014 with its obscurantist interpretation of Islam, medieval punishments and harsh treatment of women \u2014 makes for a more embarrassing U.S. ally.\"\nIt paid to export Wahhabism\n\nEstimates on the dollar amount vary, but there is widespread agreement that Saudi Arabia pays to export Wahhabism.\nUCLA history professor James Gelvin, whose research specialties include Social and cultural history of the modern Middle East, told us it\u2019s been estimated that since the 1960s, Saudi Arabia has spent $100 billion spreading Wahhabism through schools, mosques, the media and other means.\nSaudi expert David Andrew Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, told us he\u2019s not convinced the amount is that high but there\u2019s no question billions have been spent.\nAnd an August 2016 news article in the New York Times, in which three dozen academics, government officials and experts on Islam from multiple countries were interviewed, stated there has been \"lavish spending on religious outreach for half a century, estimated in the tens of billions of dollars.\"\nWahhabism is extreme\nThe Times article said Wahhabism, the Islam taught in and by Saudi Arabia, is named after an 18th-century cleric who founded it and is a \"literalist, ultraconservative form of Sunni Islam\" whose adherents \"often denigrate other Islamic sects as well as Christians and Jews.\"\nWesterners typically understand Wahhabism to be an austere form of Islam based on a literal reading of the Koran, as PolitiFact National noted in rating as Pants on Fire a claim that a school President Barack Obama attended in Indonesia taught Wahhabism. Indeed, the Islamic State adheres to strict, literal interpretations of the Koran and Islamic teachings that are rooted in Wahhabism, which is the dominant faith in Saudi Arabia, as PunditFact has reported.\nWilliam McCants, director of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World, told us Wahhabism \"is one of the most intolerant forms of Islam.\" And in Gelvin\u2019s view, Wahhabism \"has squeezed out other, more moderate forms of Islam and in many places in the Middle East, it is the only game in town.\"\nAmericans are the devil?\nThie\u00a0final part of Feingold\u2019s claim is more debatable.\n\"I would agree with everything except the \u2018Americans are the devil,\u2019\" Islamic specialist Khaleel Mohammed, a religious studies professor San Diego State University, told us. \"Having studied there, I must say I never found any insinuation as such. But, I would agree that Wahhabism promotes \u2018occidentophobia\u2019 (anti-Western sentiments among Muslims).\"\nWeinberg, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called that part of Feingold\u2019s claim debatable and other experts use different characterizations.\nThe Brookings Institution\u2019s McCants told us that \"official Saudi textbooks teach that Christians are seeking to destroy the religion and must be hated as a consequence.\"\nCalling Feingold\u2019s devil reference \"a bit of an\u00a0exaggeration,\" Gelvin said Wahhabism conflicts with American values such as equal rights for women and popular sovereignty, \"and acts as the gateway drug for many who go on to become jihadis.\""}

To claim he supports this is absurd.\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.","full_article":"While declaring his U.S. Senate bid, Republican hopeful Matt Rosendale zeroed in on the Second Amendment record of his opponent Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.\n\"Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government,\" Rosendale, Montana's state auditor,\u00a0said in a July 31 interview on Voices of Montana.\nWe decided to investigate whether\u00a0Tester supports a national gun registry. It turns out the\u00a0opposite is true.\nWhat is a national gun registry?\nThis point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry.\n\"When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned,\" said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who has authored several books on gun control.\nAn important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era\u2019s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers.\nWhile some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that\u2019s inconsistent with common parlance.\nFurther, Rosendale\u2019s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to \"the people of Montana,\" and Rosendale\u2019s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry.\nWe asked Rosendale\u2019s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Tester cast in favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate.\nDid that measure seek to establish a federal list of guns and their owners?\nNot even close.\nThe campaign\u2019s attempt to paint the Feinstein amendment as a national gun registry is absurd, and here\u2019s why\nFor the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories.\nThe Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI\u2019s list to those on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated terror watchlist of known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun.\nThe Rosendale campaign\u2019s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry.\nExperts dismissed the notion that to deny gun\u00a0sales to the government\u2019s list of known and suspected terrorists, flawed as it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners.\n\"The terror watch list is not a gun registry,\" said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. \"In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!\"\nDavid Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign\u2019s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn\u2019t add up.\n\"This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,\" Hemenway said. \"He doesn't seem to understand what a registry is.\"\nSo Rosendale\u2019s central claim is flat wrong \u2014 but he didn\u2019t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to \"ask permission from the federal government\" before they purchase a gun.\nBecause the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim\u2019s absurdity.\nThe Rosendale campaign said further that Tester\u2019s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However \u2014 leaving aside whether these bills would have done that \u2014 the reality is that Tester\u2019s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries.\nTester\u2019s opposition to a national gun registry\nTester voted for the 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, which we previously found would have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry.\nIn 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers who pushed for a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, and voted in favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as 2006 that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry).\nHe\u00a0also co-signed a 2011 letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an \"international gun registry.\" For this, Tester earned praise from the National Rifle Association for \"stand(ing) on the side of America's 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms.\""}

Bush shortly after the 9\/11 attacks, allowing government to monitor communication activity to prevent further acts of terrorism.\nThe act set many provisions to expire in 2005 but the sunset was renewed and extended to June 1, 2015. The following day, a new act passed to again extend surveillance, but with some limitations placed on phone data collection.\nU.S. Rep. Mark Pocan would have gone further. He voted against the extension and in March 2015 introduced a measure that would repeal the Patriot Act.\nPocan tried to illustrate the effect of government surveillance on everyday Americans during an appearance on Devil's Advocates radio in Madison. In the May 20, 2015 interview, he said:\n\"The Pew Foundation did a poll and what's interesting and I think a chilling effect -- 25 percent of people in the country have said they changed their email and phone habits because of this kind of collection.\"\nIs Pocan right?\nPolling results\nWhen asked for backup, Pocan's people directed us to the survey conducted by the Pew Research Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, about technology use post-Snowden.\nThe survey asked American adults for their thoughts on government surveillance programs and whether they have changed their communication technology habits since learning details about the surveillance.\nPocan claimed the poll showed 25 percent of Americans changed their email and phone habits because of the data collection allowed by the Patriot Act.\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what was found by the survey. And Pocan overstated the breadth of the changes.\nThe survey asked if respondents had heard of government surveillance programs. Then, the poll offered readers a list of technologies, such as email and cell phones, and asked how -- \u00a0if at all -- their use of the technologies had changed.\nThe percentages below represent how many said they had changed their use of an individual technology \"a great deal\" or \"somewhat.\"\nSo, the 25 percent is not for any single category, or even from combining cell phones and email. Rather, it comes from tallying how many people listed at least one of the examples.\nBehind the numbers\nThat is the number Pocan cited, but in doing so he missed some important nuances.\nFirst, the question about changing technology habits wasn't asked of everyone in the sample.\nAn earlier question asked how much respondents had heard about government collecting information about \u00a0\"telephone calls, emails and other online communications as part of efforts to monitor terrorist activity.\" The 87 percent of respondents who said they had heard \"a little\" or \"a lot\" were then asked about changing technology habits.\nSo that means, in the end, 22 percent -- not 25 percent -- of all of those surveyed said they had made such a change.\nPocan also said the 25 percent of people \"changed their email and phone habits.\" But, as noted, the list had seven categories and did not pair any two of them together.\nPocan also suggested a cause-and-effect relationship between government surveillance programs and \u00a0people changing their technology habits.\nBut the poll only asked whether respondents had changed their technology use \"since learning about U.S. phone and Internet monitoring.\"\nFor instance, someone may have dropped their landline phone service to save money, but did so some time after they heard of government surveillance.\nResearch methodology\nBeyond Pocan's fumbling with the survey data, some aspects of how the survey was done could have affected the results.\nPew used GfK Group\u2019s national KnowledgePanel survey of 475 adults conducted between November 2014 and January 2015 for the analysis.\nKnowledgePanel is a national research sample, weighted to represent the country's demographics. Respondents were invited to participate in a series of three surveys in the course of a year, all of which would be about current events technology issues.\nParticipants were told the survey questions would be about technology, which could draw people more interested in technology than the general public.\nAnd since the questions about technology use came in the third survey, the previous surveys could have sensitized respondents to pay more attention to technology issues and increase their concern.\nThose who are more interested and concerned about technology would be more likely to stick around, said Robert Griffin, professor at Marquette University\u2019s Center for Mass Media Research.\nOne in 5 dropped out between the first and third surveys.

But it\u2019s in fact even worse than she asserted. After a stretch as second-worst in the Midwest, Wisconsin moved to last on that list shortly before Kleefisch\u2019s tweet.\nAnd Evers did say around the same time he was satisfied with the state\u2019s progress, though he used the term with a caveat about vaccine availability.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.","full_article":"Wisconsin\u2019s vaccine distribution \u2014 like most everything else in Wisconsin in recent years \u2014 has sparked a partisan blame game.\nRepublicans have criticized the rollout as slow and uncoordinated, asserting Democratic Gov. Tony Evers doesn\u2019t have a sufficient plan. Evers has countered that he\u2019s doing the best he can with the available supply, claiming Vice President Mike Pence had promised vaccines from a federal reserve that didn\u2019t actually exist.\nRepublican Rebecca Kleefisch, a potential 2022 gubernatorial candidate, said Evers is leading an effort that ranks among the worst in the region.\n\"Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in our vaccination rate and the governor says he\u2019s \u2018satisfied,\u2019\" Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor under Gov. Scott Walker, said in a Jan. 14, 2021, tweet.\nDoes Wisconsin really rank that poorly?\nLet\u2019s dig in.\nWisconsin vaccine rollout among the worst\nWe\u2019ll leave for another day the question of who\u2019s to blame for the speed of Wisconsin\u2019s vaccine rollout.\nBut the status is clear \u2014 Wisconsin is among the slowest in the nation. In fact, Kleefisch was over-stating the Midwest ranking.\nState-by-state data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed 2.4% of Wisconsin residents received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine as of Jan. 13, the most recent data available when Kleefisch sent out her tweet.\nThat ranked dead last among the 12 Midwest states. North Dakota and South Dakota led that ranking with more than 5% receiving a first dose, while Ohio and Missouri joined Wisconsin at the bottom, with 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively.\nIn the preceding days, Wisconsin had ranked second-last in the Midwest.\nNationwide as of Jan. 13, Wisconsin ranked 41st out of all 50 states in vaccination rate, well off the national average of 3.1%.\nThe ranking only worsened in the ensuing week, with Wisconsin dropping to 44th by Jan. 19 while remaining last in the Midwest, according to the CDC.\nPushing back against Kleefisch\u2019s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to CDC data on the raw number of vaccinations administered. That showed Wisconsin ranked seventh out of the 12 Midwest states as of Jan. 13.\nBut that\u2019s not a reasonable way to compare progress when dealing with states that vary dramatically in population. It would be like arguing Texas is the highest-crime state because it has the most prison inmates. The latter may be true, but only because Texas has one of the highest populations. Comparing it to other states requires examining the number of inmates relative to the population (in which case Texas is not first).\nThat\u2019s where the per capita rate comes in \u2014 which is the vaccination metric used by the CDC and referenced by Kleefisch.\nCudaback also said Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process.\nYes, Evers called the progress \u2018satisfactory\u2019\nThat brings us to the second part of Kleefisch\u2019s claim, that Evers is comfortable with where the state stands.\nShe\u2019s off a bit there, at least in how she framed it.\nIn a Jan. 13 interview with WISN-TV, Evers was asked, \"Is this acceptable to you where we\u2019re at\" as a state on vaccinations.\n\"Given what we have, we can\u2019t give any more. That\u2019s the issue,\" the governor said. \"Yes, I'm satisfied where we're at because that's all we had.\"\nSo Evers isn\u2019t necessarily saying he\u2019s satisfied with being second-last (or last). He\u2019s saying he is satisfied with the progress given what he has had to work with.\nWhether that\u2019s a valid excuse is a topic for another fact check, as there are of course vaccines on hand in Wisconsin that haven\u2019t yet been administered. But he\u2019s not quite using the word in the same way Kleefisch characterized it.\nCudaback also said Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups.

It has been updated on several occasions, including laws enacted in 2010, 2016, and 2020.\nThe law says, \"The terms \u2018President-elect\u2019 and \u2018Vice-President-elect\u2019 as used in this Act shall mean such persons as are the apparent successful candidates for the office of President and Vice President, respectively, as ascertained by the Administrator following the general elections held to determine the electors of President and Vice President.\"\nThis language triggers the \"expectation that the administrator of the General Services Administration will make a common-sense decision about the election outcome,\" said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University\u2019s Robert Wagner School of Public Service. Once that decision is made, the legal basis for \"the infrastructure of support\" for a presidential transition is in place, Light said.\nThe president-elect and his team have approximately 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day to organize the new administration, and prepare to assume national security and homeland security responsibilities from the incumbent, among other tasks, according to a Nov. 13 Congressional Research Service report.\nIn general, presidential transition activities are coordinated by the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. Once the president-elect and vice president-elect have been \"ascertained\" by the GSA, federal officials are allowed to provide the transition team with facilities, funds, and services to prepare for the new administration. The money can be spent on salaries, consultants, office supplies, travel expenses and government aircraft.\nThe agency\u2019s current administrator, Emily Murphy, has not signed the required ascertainment document yet.\n\"The administrator is striving to adhere to the language and intent of the law, as well as precedent,\" GSA spokeswoman Pamela Pennington told PolitiFact. \"Please note that the law provides no process or standard by which ascertainment is made.\"\nPrior to Trump, departing presidents have generally adhered to the tradition of a smooth and straightforward transition. The laws governing the transition have enshrined the idea that the outgoing administration \"had a responsibility to hand off matters in a considered and organized fashion,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that runs a Center for Presidential Transition that advises on best practices.\nRELATED: How we know Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race\nSome nuances\nLight pointed to a statement by then-GSA Administrator David J. Barram in testimony before Congress in December 2000, at a time when the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore was so close that it had to effectively be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\"While the Act gives no explicit criteria or deadlines for making this ascertainment, as the legislative history demonstrates, Congress made it perfectly clear that if there is \u2018any question\u2019 of who the winner is \u2018in a close contest,\u2019 this determination should not be made,\" Barram testified at the time.\nIn an interview this week on CNN, Barram said the situation now is \"dramatically different\" than what he faced in 2000. \"To me, it's clear that we should be recognizing Joe Biden as the president-elect,\" he said on Nov. 19.\nThe fuzziness in the law has meant that the ascertainment has traditionally been viewed \"as pro forma,\" Stier said. \"The expectation was that it was important and should be done without having to demonstrate an extraordinary level of proof.\"\nThe absence of a clear concession and Trump\u2019s continuing efforts to fight the election results are the primary reason why the Trump-to-Biden transition has been so rocky, experts said.\n\"For 220 years, our country has had a peaceful transition of power,\" said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied transition issues. Trump has not only refused to concede, but he has \"perpetuated the myth that the election was somehow fraudulent,\" she said.\nStier argues that, even in the absence of a formal ascertainment, the Trump administration could voluntarily start doing some things to help the incoming administration get ready, such as sharing intelligence, encouraging meetings with public health officials, and allowing security-clearance investigations to begin.\n\"This is not about some abstract decision that GSA has to make \u2014 it\u2019s about choices being made to pursue a policy of noncooperation,\" Stier said.\nLight lays the blame on Trump, not on Murphy, who he says is required to answer to a vague law.\n\"Everything here hinges on good faith,\" Light said. \"The GSA administrator may have been well within the boundaries of the statute to deny a formal launch decision, but Trump's interference and threats have poisoned the cooperative relationship that has long marked the process, even after bitter campaigns such as 1980, when Reagan bested Carter for the presidency.\"\nRELATED: How narrow was Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Donald Trump?"}

Trump has referenced her foundation ties in the past, saying she needs to \"return the $25 million\" Saudi Arabia gave the foundation.\nThe William J. Clinton Foundation was incorporated in 1997. The foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009.\nWe wondered whether the Clintons\u2019 donor list holds up to Trump\u2019s claim.\nBut first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot take money from foreign entities.\n\"The prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not only governments,\" said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at\u00a0Albany.\nHillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin also noted that the former first lady played no role in the foundation while she was secretary of state.\n\"Further, she did not blink before standing up to countries that oppressed their people and denied them of their rights, from LGBT rights to women's rights,\" Schwerin said.\nNonetheless. looking at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s donor list, Saudi Arabia gave between $10 million and $25 million. But the foundation reported the Saudi money in December 2008,\u00a0and the amount hasn\u2019t changed since.\u00a0Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department.\nThe foundation has also taken between\u00a0$1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The Wall Street Journal reported, several of these donations came in 2014, after Clinton's tenure at the State Department.\nWe've fact-checked a similar claim before when\u00a0Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of \"Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen.\" Every country except Yemen has contributed\u00a0to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus' claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money. We rated it Half True.\nWomen\u2019s rights\nHuman Rights Watch tracks how women are treated in each of these countries.\nIn Saudi Arabia, a woman needs \"male guardian\" approval on everything from obtaining a passport to seeking higher education. They also have no divorce rights.\nThe same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children.\nIn Qatar, marital rape is permitted. Women need a male guardian to approve a marriage contract, and one law specifies that a wife must obey her husband.\nAnd in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that while there is a nondiscrimination law, women still face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce.\nGay rights\nAccording to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, all sex outside of marriage, including same-sex intercourse,\u00a0in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death.\nFor a married man, the penalty is death by stoning. An unmarried man faces 100 blows of a whip.\nIn Qatar, any sexual act outside of marriage is punishable by death.\nThe United Arab Emirates also bans sex outside of marriage,\u00a0and the death penalty could apply to consensual \"same-sex relations.\"\nAs for Oman, the country punishes same-sex acts by up to three years in prison.\nAs for Trump's claim that these countries are throwing gay people \"off of\u00a0buildings,\"\u00a0he may be referring to the Islamic State. There is evidence that\u00a0ISIS\u00a0has engaged in these acts, but in Syria.\nExecutions in Saudi Arabia specifically have increased recently, but\u00a0specific convictions, and whether are they related to homosexuality,\u00a0are hard to measure.\nNot Clinton directly\nExperts we spoke with questioned whether the donations to the foundation are directly attributable to Hillary Clinton.\nIndiana University public affairs professor emeritus Leslie Lenkowsky said Trump\u2019s claim is hyperbolic.\n\"These were not donations to Secretary Clinton as such, but to an organization with which she was closely involved (when not in office or seeking it), including serving as a director,\" Lenkowsky said.\nAccording to Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, nonprofits often have to consider donors\u2019 actions when they give money. The stakes are usually higher when the nonprofit involves a political figure.\n\"These are gifts not to Clinton herself but to the foundation that shares her name,\" he said.\nThe United States\u00a0remains allies with some of these countries, such as Saudi\u00a0Arabia,\u00a0United Arab Emirates and Qatar, despite their poor record with human rights."}

Such grants were prohibited in 2014. Did Pres. Obama grant an exception?\"\nTo answer Giuliani\u2019s question, no exception was granted, because none was needed.\nThe policy that hit pause on certain research in 2014 didn\u2019t apply to the sort of work that was being done in Wuhan.\nGiuliani\u2019s wrong about what the policy was, and he\u2019s wrong about the dollars that went to the Wuhan lab.\nLet\u2019s unpack this.\nObama administration taps the brakes on virus research\nIn the summer of 2014, a cardboard box of vials labeled Variola was found in an ordinary cold storage room on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The variola virus causes smallpox, and it had no place outside of a secure biological facility.\nIn August 2014, the Obama administration called for a nationwide stand-down and review for all labs working with potentially deadly biological agents. On Oct. 17, 2014, the White House announced it would not fund new projects that involved a certain kind of research called gain-of-function.\nLike the phrase suggests, gain-of-function research boosts the ability of a pathogen to cause disease. Why would anyone want to do that, outside of building a biological weapon? Well, this sort of work can help spot potential threats and give researchers time to craft ways to thwart a new virus.\nAdministration officials said that until they had new policies, this sort of work on viruses that cause influenza, MERS and SARS (two new diseases that had triggered pandemics) wouldn\u2019t get new money, and they asked labs with research underway to hit pause.\nBut the administration specifically let other research continue. The language is technical, but the key word is \"naturally.\"\n\"The funding pause will not apply to the characterization or testing of naturally occurring influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses unless there is a reasonable expectation that these tests would increase transmissibility or pathogenicity,\" the Oct. 17 policy said.\nThe Wuhan lab worked with naturally occurring viruses.\nThe policy and the Wuhan lab\nThe Wuhan Institute of Virology was participating in a project led by the New York-based organization EcoHealth Alliance. That\u2019s a nonprofit that aims to protect the people, land and animals in areas where viruses can jump from one species to another, as coronaviruses are known to do.\nIn 2014, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease backed work that focused on bats in Yunnan province, about 800 miles southwest from Wuhan, on the border with Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Teams in the field gathered blood from bats and local residents. They sent the samples to Wuhan where the initial analysis took place.\nThe point is, any viruses found emerged in nature.\n\"The policy would not prohibit government agencies from funding any and all research at Wuhan Institute of Virology,\" said Gregory Koblentz, George Mason University associate professor of biodefense.\nIt\u2019s possible, Koblentz said, that some work done as part of the larger U.S. project might have involved gain-of-function experiments, but whether those would fall under the specific types of gain-of-function research covered by the restriction was doubtful.\n\"To the best of my understanding, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s claim is not consistent with reality,\" said\u00a0 John Holdren, one of the architects of the Obama administration\u2019s policy and a former assistant to the president for science and technology.\nThe work the lab did for the project did not involve gain-of-function research, but it is possible that other projects at the lab did.\nAdded Robert Kessler with the EcoHealth Alliance: \"We have not ever participated in gain-of-function research. Nor have we ever been funded to participate in gain-of-function research.\"\nGiuliani\u2019s claim has another flaw \u2014 timing. The moratorium policy took effect October 2014. The grant was approved at the end of May, five months earlier.\nWe reached out to Giuliani and did not hear back.\nWrong year, wrong amount\nGiuliani said the National Institutes of Health gave $3.7 million to the lab in Wuhan in 2017.\nThe correct amount is $598,500, according to the EcoHealth Alliance.\nThe NIH website shows that the total size of the grant was $3.4 million. About 15% of that went to the Wuhan lab. The grant was awarded in 2014, not 2017, as Giuliani said."}

City Blue Imaging Services in Rochester NY burned to the ground. They printed ballots there.

However Nelson didn\u2019t say they are identical: He said that we already have such \u2018navigators\u2019 to help Floridians access services.\nWe rate this claim True.","full_article":"Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., has a message for Republican Gov. Rick Scott who doesn\u2019t want Obamacare \"navigators\" spreading the word about the health care law: Relax. We\u2019ve had similar folks helping Floridians navigate health care programs for many years.\nScott has sought to ban Obamacare navigators from county health departments and has faced some blowback: Broward and Pinellas counties have refused to comply and Miami-Dade may follow their lead.\nNelson portrayed Scott as a hypocrite because he said there are already similar navigators who help Floridians with questions about health insurance.\n\"State officials have so far failed to mention that these \u2018consumer helpers\u2019 have been serving the people of Florida in various ways for years -- and, yes, even with the current governor's full backing,\" Nelson wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed Sept. 19. \"In fact, many state and federal agencies have such \u2018navigators\u2019 involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example -- even buying health insurance. That\u2019s right: even when buying health insurance created by the state. From Medicaid to Medicare, from veterans' organizations to the state's own KidCare insurance program, navigators are available to make sure Floridians get assistance.\"\nAre there already similar navigators who help the public access health insurance and other services? We went in search of the examples cited by Nelson.\nObamacare navigators\nFirst, some background on Obamacare navigators.\nThe Affordable Care Act awarded $8 million in federal grants to eight Florida entities to hire navigators, including the University of South Florida-based program Florida Covering Kids & Families and Pinellas County. Florida state leaders declined to set up their own marketplace or work with the federal government to run it together, leaving the job to the federal government.\nNavigators must go through at least 20 hours of training and be fingerprinted before they can become certified. Their job is to offer impartial information about health plans and the availability of tax credits and subsidies to offset the cost of a plan. They are not allowed to direct consumers to specific plans or receive payments from insurers, businesses or consumers.\nNavigators will begin enrolling people within days as the insurance marketplaces known as exchanges launch Oct. 1.\nMedicare\/Medicaid counselors\nIn our search for something similar to Obamacare navigators, we started with Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, which serves the poor.\n\"The navigator program is similar to Medicare counselors, which have existed for years and never faced this kind of bullying from Florida,\" said U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman Fabien Levy.\nStates receive federal grants to hire people that help Medicare beneficiaries enroll for coverage, and this year Florida received about $3 million.\nThe Florida version of the program is called SHINE (Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders) and is overseen by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, which contracts with local Area Agency on Aging groups. Florida has 463 SHINE volunteers.\nSHINE volunteers aren\u2019t involved in Obamacare and aren\u2019t called navigators, said Ashley Marshall, spokeswoman for the state Department of Elder Affairs.\nBut they fulfill a similar role in that they help guide Floridians who need insurance.\nSHINE volunteers assist seniors primarily with questions about Medicare, and sometimes Medicaid if a client qualifies for both. Outreach efforts include a helpline and spreading the word at community events.\n\"What we provide is free unbiased information,\" said Charles Franckle, SHINE coordinator for Pinellas County. \"When people are approaching Medicare they might contact us to ask us should they sign up for Part A and B and how do they do it.\"\nSHINE volunteers don\u2019t endorse a particular plan. But they can answer questions about the differences between the various Medicare options by teaching the callers how to use the Medicare.gov website or doing it for them and sending them the results.\nPaid employees provide Medicaid counseling through the state Agency for Health Care Administration or contracted vendors. The counselors assist recipients via phone, in writing or in person and conduct community outreach and education.\nFlorida KidCare insurance\nFlorida\u2019s KidCare health insurance program for poor children includes outreach to help families sign up for care. An outreach calendar for September showed various community events statewide where families could learn more about KidCare, such as at Pasco County\u2019s Kids Health and Safety Day.\nIn fact, KidCare even uses the term \"navigators.\"\nA Nelson spokesman pointed to a 2012 sample contract that stated the Florida Healthy Kids Corp. was seeking grant proposals from \"eligible organizations to become Regional Navigators and assist eligible families in applying for or retaining Florida KidCare.\"\nThree entities signed that contract: Health Council of Southeast Florida, Broward County Health Department and United Way of Marion County, according to the Florida Healthy Kids Corp.\nLegislative appropriations earmarked for Florida KidCare outreach were eliminated in July 2003, said Christie Goss, spokeswoman for Florida Healthy Kids Corp., a KidCare partner. But community groups statewide continue to promote KidCare and help the public enroll.\nFlorida Healthy Kids provides some grants for KidCare promotion -- about $900,000 since 2011-12.\nThe University of South Florida\u2019s Covering Kids and Families, which received an Obamacare navigator grant, has been doing outreach for enrollment for KidCare and Medicaid since 1999 with state, federal and foundation grants.\n\"We work with schools, churches, hospitals, businesses, etc.,\" said program director Jodi Ray. \"We conduct our outreach and education activities wherever we have the best chance to reach people who need this information. We also have a military outreach project that specifically focuses on making sure that both active duty and veteran families get the information they need about getting their kids covered. The enrollment assistance is an important component of the outreach efforts.\"\nThe particular requirements and training for Obamacare navigators and those who assist Floridians with KidCare or Medicaid can vary. However, \"it\u2019s very similar in that we are helping people apply for health coverage,\" Ray said. \"We are not collecting medical health information -- we are simply helping them understand how to navigate the process without getting overwhelmed or confused and be able to answer questions so they can make decisions they need to make.\"\nVeterans\nThe Florida Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits counseling related to state and federal veterans\u2019 programs. The department has paid claims examiners who work out of VA medical centers, clinics and nursing homes and provide benefits counseling to help connect Floridians to benefits such as disability payments and pensions. The counselors don\u2019t enroll veterans in health care but do point them in the right direction.\nScott\u2019s response\nWe sent Nelson\u2019s claim and a summary of our findings of positions similar to Obamacare navigators to Scott\u2019s office and received a short reply:\n\"How many of those \u2018navigators\u2019 use the federal data hub?\" said spokeswoman Melissa Sellers in an email.\nBut spokespersons for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told us that navigators can\u2019t access the \"hub\", which provides a way to transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information.\n\"Navigators won\u2019t be tied into the federal data hub. They will enroll people through the online interface that all consumers have access to at healthcare.gov,\" said Brian Cook, a CMS spokesman.\nWe heard other comments from state agency spokespersons about differences in the training or requirements for Obamacare navigators compared to other types of benefits counselors. But Nelson didn\u2019t make a claim about background checks or other requirements."}

Although investigations showed that some officials thought it was a terrorist attack immediately, there at least appeared to be some question about whether the video could have played a role.\nRubio exaggerates when he said there wasn\u2019t a \"single shred of evidence.\" There were several suggestions that it was because of a protest. However, he has a point that much of the early evidence pointed strongly to terrorism. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.","full_article":"U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio portrayed Hillary Clinton as lying about the circumstances of the Benghazi attack when she said the attacks were the result of an anti-Muslim video instead of al-Qaida-like terrorists.\n\"There was not a single person on the ground in Benghazi who believed that it was a spontaneous uprising,\" he said in an interview on CNN on Oct. 29, 2015.\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked Rubio how it could be a lie if the CIA told Clinton it was due to a demonstration.\nRubio replied: \"She consistently, privately told people, over and over again, including in the early aftermath of it, that this was led by al-Qaida-like elements. There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on, irrespective of what the administration is telling you now.\"\nWe wanted to fact-check what Rubio said about what the CIA understood, drawing on the seven congressional investigations that followed, as well as news articles provided by Rubio and testimony by officials that the Clinton campaign sent us.\nWhat we found is a very murky situation. It seems like there were indications early on that the attacks were not the result of simple protests. But also early on, some in the government did seem to think that demonstrations over the video were a factor. That constitutes something of a \"shred,\" contrary to what Rubio said.\nTimeline of reports about what prompted the attacks\nTo try to sort out the evidence, we created a timeline to show when information was shared about the reason for the attacks. (Other media have created their own timelines, including Factcheck.org and the Washington Post\u2019s The Fact Checker.)\nSept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks.\nSept. 11, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met with Defense Department officials a couple hours after the attack \"to discuss the Benghazi attack and other violence in the region in reaction to the anti-Muslim video,\" according to a report from the bipartisan Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Several officials later told this committee that they believed it was a terrorist attack immediately or almost immediately.\nSept. 11, 2012: Clinton issued a statement that didn\u2019t indicate a cause for the attack but said, \"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet.\" At 11:12 p.m. Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying the attack was conducted by an al-Qaida like group.\nAnother email revealed that Clinton, during a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks.\nHowever, 24 hours after taking responsibility for the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia retracted the claim.\nSept. 11, 2012: Two alerts were issued by the State Department Operations Center to administration officials, according to the House Republican Conference report. The first said the U.S. facilities were under attack, while the second linked the attacks to Ansar al-Sharia. Neither alert mentioned a protest related to the video.\nSept. 12, 2012: In the first CIA assessment of the attacks, the CIA said \"the presence of armed assailants from the incident\u2019s outset suggests this was an intentional assault and not the escalation of a peaceful protest.\"\nAccording to the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee report, the CIA later said the initial assessment lacked supporting evidence and was subsequently left out of reports. Meanwhile, analysts \"received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi.\" Fourteen of those reports were issued from the Open Source Center (a CIA intelligence center), while the rest came from the CIA, the Defense Department and the NSA.\nHowever, the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found issues with the reports because they included information from early news reports, not just original intelligence. The reports were also based on intercepted communications and informants\u2019 tips, according to the New York Times.\nSept, 12, 2012: President Barack Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden, said, \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation.\" While he didn\u2019t refer to the video directly, Obama did say, \"We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others.\"\nSept. 15, 2012: The CIA\u2019s chief of station in Tripoli wrote an email to the then-deputy director of the CIA saying that the attacks were \"not an escalation of protests.\"\nThe intelligence community \"also had information that there were no protests outside the Temporary Mission Facility prior to the attacks, but did not incorporate that information into its widely circulated assessments in a timely manner,\" according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report.\nSept. 16, 2012: United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on five Sunday talk shows. She talked about the video several times and said, \"We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.\"\nShe said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that the current assessment was the attack was \"a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video.\"\nThe administration was later criticized for the talking points fed to Rice in advance of her interviews. In an email from Ben Rhodes, the then-deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, one of those talking points stated: \"Since we began to see protests in response to this Internet video, the president has directed the administration to take a number of steps.\"\nSept. 18, 2012: The CIA and FBI reviewed video footage from the Benghazi compound that showed no protests preceding the attack.\nSept. 19, 2012: Director of National Intelligence Matt Olsen said during a congressional hearing\u00a0that the State Department officials in Benghazi died \"in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy.\"\nSept. 20, 2012: Clinton said during a press conference that \"the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.\"\nSept. 21, 2012: Clinton attributed the attack to terrorism during a press conference: \"What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans.\"\nSept. 24, 2012: The CIA changed its assessment of the attacks after determining that no protests occurred outside the Benghazi facility before the attacks.\nSept. 28, 2012: Shawn Turner, a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence, issued a statement that officials initially thought that the attack was spontaneous but soon concluded that terrorists were involved:\n\"In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. ... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.\"\nRubio campaign evidence\nAs for whether there was never\u00a0\"a single shred of evidence\" presented that\u00a0the attack was spontaneous despite what Clinton said, a\u00a0spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to news articles in conservative media about what Clinton and the former acting CIA director Michael Morell said about the attacks.\nFor example, in an Oct. 23, 2015,\u00a0Fox News report, Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods, who died in the Benghazi attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton on Sept. 14, 2012. The two spoke at a ceremony when the victims\u2019 bodies were flown back to the United States.\n\"I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son,\" the entry said.\nIn Morell\u2019s 2015 book The Great War of Our Time, Morell wrote, \"Still others might have been motivated by the video -- although I should note our analysts never said the video was a factor in the Benghazi attacks.\"\nClinton campaign evidence\nClinton\u2019s campaign also pointed to statements made by government officials who described initial confusion.\n\"I think that the first week after 9\/11, there was significant uncertainty about what had happened and disagreement among key people who shaped opinion,\" State Department Office Director for Maghreb Affairs William Roebuck told the Democratic Staff Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in August 2013.\nAdding to the confusion was that the Benghazi attack occurred around the same time as protests over the anti-Muslim video in Cairo.\n\"There was some confusion about have you had -- was this the same thing, were these two incidents the same, were they different?\" Roebuck said. \"The interagency was trying to sort that out. They were also trying to sort out the conflicting information from Benghazi itself. ... Like I said, there was a dispute among people who were looking very carefully at all of the evidence on the ground, and there was a legitimate disagreement about what had sort of been the precursor to the attack.\""}

The articles he cited actually were more specific than he suggested. Pollsters did say that surveys can\u2019t be used with surgical precision to separate the wheat from the chaff in the crowded Republican field. But that\u2019s in response to broadcasters who have counted on polls to decide who should appear in debates.\nAs for Gallup, a news article implied that concerns over methodology drove its decision to stop tracking the primaries, but the editor-in-chief at Gallup didn\u2019t say that and in fact, he expressed confidence in the firm\u2019s techniques.\nIt\u2019s costing more and more to do polling well, and state-level polls, which are the ones Deace had in mind, face the biggest challenges. But overall, Deace exaggerated what pollsters have said.\nWe rate this claim Half True.","full_article":"In the Republican presidential nomination contest, polls have been the outsiders\u2019 best friend. Billionaire Donald Trump and physician Ben Carson gained early momentum and critical debate exposure thanks almost entirely to their high rankings in public opinion surveys.\nWhat those poll numbers say about Trump and Carson\u2019s chances in the Iowa caucuses and beyond is far murkier. Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace said the polls are meaningless.\n\"The record of polling in Iowa is a joke,\" Deace said on MSNBC\u2019s News Nation on Oct. 8, 2015. \"You\u2019ve got the pollsters now coming out in numerous articles in recent days saying \u2018don\u2019t actually believe our own data.\u2019 You have Gallup yesterday made the announcement, they\u2019re pulling out of polling in this primary. They may not even poll the general election because they don\u2019t trust their methodology.\"\nA lot of people wonder about the accuracy of the polls, and it would be a big deal if the pollsters themselves were just as skeptical. We decided to drill down on Deace\u2019s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data, and that Gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn\u2019t trust its methodology.\nA cluster of articles\nDeace told us he relied on several stories that came out recently. Bloomberg wrote about systematic flaws in the data. High on the list: -- the rise of cell phone-only households and a growing percentage of people who refuse to answer pollsters\u2019 questions.\nThe best public opinion operations employ banks of callers who are fed randomly picked phone numbers. Cell phones make it tougher to determine where the interviewee actually lives, which matters a lot for state-level polls. Plus, federal rules about calling cell phones mean you must hand-dial each one, rather than use a faster automated dialer. That\u2019s a significant cost factor.\nAnd then there\u2019s the response rate. When more people hang up, that raises questions about whether the people who participate are unrepresentative of the public at large.\n\"As response rates have declined, the need to rely on risky mathematical maneuvers has increased,\" the Bloomberg article said.\nThere was also a report\u00a0from Politico that carried a warning from pollsters. They said they shouldn\u2019t be the ones \"to winnow the GOP field.\"\n\"Don\u2019t trust polls to detect often-tiny grades of opinion in a giant field,\" the Politico writer summarized.\nThe point was, news organizations sponsoring debates are counting on polls to decide who to bring on the stage and who to cut. With over a dozen Republican candidates, many of them clustered in the single-digits, the differences between any two are nearly certain to be smaller than the polls\u2019 well-published margin of error.\nIf just 1 percentage point separates Candidate A from Candidate B, and the margin of error is 3.5 percent, you have a problem.\nBut it\u2019s not a problem that stems from the polling itself. As the Politico article noted, it\u2019s a problem with how debate organizers are using the polls.\nWhat\u2019s up with Gallup?\nSo those two articles are the grounds for the first part of Deace\u2019s statement. Then there was his comment about Gallup. The bombshell in the polling world, as these things go, was Gallup\u2019s decision to pull back from tracking the presidential primaries. This came out in another Politico article headlined, \"Gallup gives up the horse race.\"\n\"After a bruising 2012 cycle, in which its polls were farther off than most of its competitors, Gallup told Politico it isn't planning any polls for the presidential primary horse race this cycle,\" Politico wrote. \"And, even following an internal probe into what went wrong last time around, Gallup won't commit to tracking the general election next year.\"\nGallup is one of the granddaddies of polling and had done a lot of polls in past elections. It was no small thing for the primaries to lose such a prominent player.\nFrank Newport, Gallup\u2019s editor-in-chief, told Politico that the polling firm thought it could have more impact by asking people what they think about issues, rather than who they want to see in the White House.\nWhile the article drew a connection between Gallup\u2019s move and its polling methods, Newport himself didn\u2019t say that. And afterward, he sent around a statement rebutting the story\u2019s broader implication.\n\"Unlike some critics, we at Gallup remain very strong in our belief in the accuracy of polling today, even with the new challenges that are in front of the industry,\" Newport said. \"Our post-mortem work in 2012\/2013 and our experimentation in the 2014 midterms leave us with little doubt that polling, including our own, can be accurate in 2016.\"\nTaking Newport\u2019s words at face value, worries about Gallup\u2019s methodology did not drive its decision.\nDeace told us he had not seen Newport\u2019s statement.\nCharles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, told us he thinks this was more a business decision, but the picture is complicated. Gallup does a lot of contract work for businesses, and in\u00a0that context, political polling comes with a risk.\n\"You can be judged by how you do on the presidential vote in November,\" Franklin said. \"If you have troubles with that, it creates problems for the company.\"\nFranklin said he thinks Gallup does as good a job as anybody, but he can see why the firm might decide it makes more sense to pull back from election tracking.\nPolling in changing times\nThere\u2019s no question that it has become trickier and more expensive to be accurate. It\u2019s also clear that the better financed pollsters adapt. Statistics researchers Ole Forsberg and Mark Payton at Oklahoma State University focused on the cell phone issue. Forsberg told us the pollsters have come up with a variety of approaches. He said while we won\u2019t know which ones work best until this election is over, he\u2019s optimistic.\n\"The current polling methods are most likely more accurate than in 2012,\" Forsberg said. \"They may be more accurate than in 2008. They are most likely worse than in 2004.\"\nPolling in 2004 was more reliable because landlines were more common back then, and landlines are inherently easier to work with than cell phones.\nAs for the hurdle of rising refusal rates, Franklin said the survey firms, including his, spend more time getting full interviews.\n\"We have to call many more numbers to get a big enough sample size, but there\u2019s plenty of evidence that we\u2019re reaching enough,\" he said.\nHistorical trends collected by the National Council on Public Polls, a trade association of pollsters, track the gap between polling and actual voting results in presidential years. In 2012, the average error was 1.46 percentage points. That was slightly higher than in the previous three elections in 2008, 2004 and 2000, but less than the error in 1996 when it was 2.1 percentage points.\nJon Krosnick at Stanford University has assessed polls for many years. Krosnick distinguishes between polling organizations that dot their I\u2019s and cross their T\u2019s, and those that don\u2019t.\n\"Our evaluations of survey accuracy indicate that surveys done using best practices, which is expensive, continue to be remarkably accurate,\" Krosnick said. \"If you look at the average of the final pre-election polls done by the neutral news organizations that used high quality methods just before the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, they predicted the national popular vote within one percentage point.\"\nKrosnick said the danger lies in the proliferation of firms that do polling on the cheap. Those results, he said, could give the impression that polling in general is less accurate.\nAll that said, Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers University political scientist and former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, warns that no one should underestimate the challenges polling faces today. Zukin said there\u2019s a huge issue of figuring out who will actually vote and all the problems only get worse at the state level where much of the attention is focused during the primaries.\n\"We are less sure how to conduct good survey research now than we were four years ago, and much less than eight years ago,\" Zukin wrote in an op-ed.\nA particularly subtle form of error seems to have crept into the picture. Nate Silver, a statistician who grew famous for his accurate election predictions and is now editor-in-chief of 538.com, has written about the \"herding\" phenomenon. That\u2019s when polling firms fear to publish results that don\u2019t track with other polls.\n\"Pollsters have admitted to suppressing polls they deem to be outliers but that would have turned out to be just right,\" Silver wrote in 538. \"In the U.S. last year, at least two polling firms declined to publish surveys showing a tight Senate race in Virginia, which in the end was decided by only 18,000 votes in what was almost a historic upset.\"\nEarly polls in a class by themselves\nFrom what we found, most research into polling accuracy looks at surveys done in the final weeks of a campaign. Right now, we are nearly four months before the first ballot is cast in Iowa. Deace said he thinks the polls are a joke because he doesn\u2019t think they reflect who will carry the caucuses.\nFranklin at Marquette University told us for pollsters, that\u2019s the wrong question.\n\"This is very much like midway through the second quarter of a football game,\" he said. \"It is not telling you with great certainty who will win the game. But it is telling you who's playing well and who isn't. And we still have the second half to play.\"\nFranklin said, if you don\u2019t think the score at halftime tells the whole story, you shouldn\u2019t expect any more from polls at this stage of the primary process."}

And they don\u2019t accurately reflect what we know about what this plan would cost, or the extent to which it proposes specific new taxes.\nThis claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts and assumes more than the evidence warrants. We rate it Mostly False.","full_article":"Sparring over \"Medicare for All\" and universal health care, Vice President Joe Biden leaned on a new variation of attack line, highlighting potential costs to middle-class Americans.\n\"For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes,\" Biden said at the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate.\nWe\u2019ve heard many debates over what Medicare for All could ultimately cost, but these specific figures were new to us. And the health plan \u2014 pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and backed as well by Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 leaves many details yet to be colored in.\nWe were curious where these figures came from, and how they could be derived. So we decided to dig in.\nThe numbers\nWe contacted the Biden campaign, which told us the figure was derived from approximating the impact of a 4% income tax, plus a 7.5% payroll tax \u2014 financing mechanisms they said have been proposed by Sanders.\nWhen you do the math, that suggests a family making $60,000 would indeed see the tax increase Biden surmised.\nBut this math is problematic on many levels.\nFor one thing, Sanders\u2019 bill doesn\u2019t actually propose financing Medicare for All through a combined 4% income tax and 7.5% payroll tax. The bill doesn\u2019t include any financing mechanism at all.\nIn a separate document, Sanders talks about different ways to pay for the system \u2014 and those are listed as two examples of pay-fors. But they aren\u2019t the only ones, and Sanders frames this list as \"a number of options to begin [the] discussion.\"\nSo suggesting that Medicare for All would increase taxes as specifically as Biden suggests is an inaccurate reflection of the bill.\nAnother issue is that there isn\u2019t a good sense of what this health plan would cost, so any estimate of its tax burden is really just a guess.\n\"There are so many unknowns that you cannot say anything definitive,\" said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University.\nBiden\u2019s statement \"could be true,\" he added \u2014 but \"there\u2019s no evidence either way.\"\nTaxes versus costs\nAnd there\u2019s another issue, said Ellen Meara, a health economist at Dartmouth College. That is, highlighting the potential tax burden of Medicare for All without discussing overall costs is misleading, she argued.\nMeara pointed to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that the average employer-sponsored plan for a family of four costs $20,000 per in premiums. That, economists say, results in lower wages for employees. Many argue that if employers were relieved of this cost, that would translate into people earning significantly more in take-home pay.\n\"A $5,000 or $6,000 tax is really quite small compared with what middle-class families forego in cash wages to get employer-sponsored coverage,\" Meara said."}

By the end, nearly two decades later, the school received $1 billion from the state, and Lager, who once had financial problems, became a millionaire.\nNow politicians on both sides are spinning answers to key questions: Who is to blame for the online school bilking state taxpayers? Who gets credit for the school\u2019s demise?\nThe Ohio Department of Education is seeking to recoup $80 million from the school, while State Auditor Dave Yost referred his findings to state and federal prosecutors for potential criminal prosecution.\nState Rep. Keith Faber, the Republican candidate for state auditor, took some credit for the school shutting down.\n\"Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President and the diligent work of Auditor Yost and his staff, ECOT was caught and is out of business,\" he said in a May 11 statement to the press.\nDemocrats pounced on Faber for taking credit.\nFaber\u2019s Democratic opponent Zack Space tweeted: \"Keith Faber\u2019s complicity in this \u2014 perhaps the largest political scandal in Ohio history \u2014 should disqualify him from serving as Auditor, the top taxpayer watchdog in the State.\"\nTime for PolitiFact to weigh in: Is Faber accurate in claiming credit for ECOT shutting down?\nWe found that when Faber was Senate president, the Legislature voted for a bill that included attendance rules for online schools in 2015. But the main reason the school shut down was a change in the type of student participation data that the state education department sought. And the department began seeking the data before the 2015 legislation passed.\nFaber points to House Bill 2\nFaber\u2019s spokeswoman Allison\u00a0Dumski pointed to his role as Senate president in passing HB 2, a charter schools bill. The final version passed the Senate unanimously and the House overwhelmingly in October 2015.\nA\u00a0provision added in the Senate required online schools to keep \"an accurate record of each individual student's participation in learning opportunities each day.\" The bill said that the records must be kept in a manner that could easily be submitted to state officials.\n\"ECOT was unable to provide these attendance records or comply with Ohio Department of Education's student count, requiring them to repay the state, which ultimately put them in financial distress and caused them to close,\" Dumski said.\nThe passage of the bill drew praise from newspaper editorial boards and education advocates.\nBut the bill essentially codified what\u00a0the education department had already started. The wheels were already in motion for the state to seek millions from the school.\nOnline school faced problems from the beginning\nFor years, news reports showed the online charter school had problems with poor record keeping, high student turnover, suspicious attendance reports, poor performance outcomes\u00a0and graduation rates, and inflated enrollment. State audits showed problems as early as 2001.\nWhile the school racked up troubling headlines, Lager (the school's founder) gave campaign donations, largely to Republicans. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Lager and other executives made $2.1 million in donations. The FBI is examining whether the company reimbursed employees for donations, the Dispatch found. (Faber announced in May that he would donate the approximately $36,000 he received to other schools.)\nBy 2015, the state began to suspect that some schools were inflating their participation numbers. So it began to request actual log-in data for students.\nFor ECOT, that meant trouble.\nThe department found that for the 2015-16 school year, the online school could only account for 6,300 of its 15,300 claimed students. That eventually led the state to demand that the school repay $60 million, and later an additional $20 million for the next school year.\nThe school argued that the department illegally changed its rules for counting students. But the courts have sided with the state. The school continues to appeal.\nIn 2017, the state started withholding $2.5 million per month from the school.\nIn January, the school\u2019s sponsor, The Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West, cut off ties. Charter schools must have a sponsor to operate. About 12,000 students had to find new schools."}

They risk their lives every day to help save ours. But Sheriff David Clarke says 911 is not our best option.\"\nDoes the new ad, paid for by the union-backed Greater Wisconsin Committee, accurately reflect Clarke\u2019s views?\nSpecifically, has Clarke advised citizens to \"point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" because \"911 is not our best option?\"\nA familiar controversy\nClarke faces Milwaukee Police lieutenant Chris Moews in the Democratic primary for sheriff on Aug. 12, 2014.\nThe new ad resurrects a controversy that began in January 2013 when Clarke\u2019s office paid for a radio announcement in which he said: \"With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back. But are you prepared?\"\nThat prompted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story with this online headline: \"Sheriff David Clarke\u2019s radio ad says 911 not best option, urges residents to take firearms classes.\"\nAfter Clarke\u2019s radio spot, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett criticized him, saying if there\u2019s an emergency, \"I want people to call 911\" but Sheriff Clarke is \"discouraging people from calling 911, it\u2019s just wrong.\"\nAbout six weeks later, Clarke sat for a long interview with Project Veritas, a conservative group. that posted it online. The snippets of Clarke speaking in the Greater Wisconsin ad are from this interview.\nIn that interview, Clarke said that Barrett had \"contorted\" the message in his radio spot by suggesting that he was advising that nobody call 911.\nThe sheriff explained that it\u2019s up to individual citizens to decide for themselves what they will do when confronted with possible harm.\nAt the same time, Clarke made it clear not only what he personally would do, but what he would advise as the best course of action for citizens.\nHe spoke in the context of potentially immediate danger, an example being an intruder breaking into your home.\nTwice he said the \"advice\" he would give people was based on what he himself would do:\n\"Use cover, because you don\u2019t know if that clown trying to break into your house is armed. Know who and what your target is. Point that barrel center mass and pull the trigger.\"\nHe does not mention calling 911 in that sequence.\nThen he concludes: \"You see, the thing is 911 in that situation is not going to help you and that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s not your best option.\"\nSo the ad, notably, gets the \"not your best option\" context right.\nThe other Clarke quote in the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad is from a section of the Project Veritas interview in which Clarke talks more about what he personally would do in that situation.\nClarke tells the interviewer that a sign hangs on his own home picturing the head of a Rottweiler and a semiautomatic handgun with the message: \"We don\u2019t dial 911.\"\n\"I don\u2019t call 911,\" Clarke explained. \"I will afterwards, to say \u2018Come get this dead guy out of my house, he\u2019s bleeding out and he\u2019s messing up my carpet. And that\u2019s not to sound, you know \u2026 that\u2019s just the reality. I\u2019m not going to fool around with that. But that\u2019s the mindset I have but I\u2019ve been a cop for 35 years, so I live with that every day and it becomes second nature...\"\nThe sheriff, at that point in the interview, shifts back to what he\u2019d like law abiding residents to consider doing. Government shouldn\u2019t tell them what to do, he said.\n\"I trust them to make those decisions as to what to do,\" Clarke said. \"If they want to blow a whistle, fine, I don\u2019t tell them not to.\"\nBut he made clear that he feels the best option is not waiting around for the police, or hiding under the bed, or running away.\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be very effective in some of these situations,\" Clarke said. \"So I want people to think about what\u2019s going to be effective. If you want to run out of your house, fine, I\u2019m not running out of my house unless it\u2019s on fire. That\u2019s my house, and I\u2019m not running from it to give the bad guy carte blanche.\"\nAd vs. reality\nSo how does the Greater Wisconsin ad compare to Clarke\u2019s statements?\nThe ad, despite the length limitations, gets Clarke\u2019s message right and places it in the context -- using Clarke\u2019s own words -- of a home invasion situation.\nNeither Clarke nor the ad is saying the sheriff suggests that calling 911 is never a good idea. (Clarke, in the interview, at one point seems to suggest he wants average citizens to call 911 if they can -- but then take matters into their own hands rather than wait for police to arrive).\nThe other Clarke quote in the ad -- \"point the barrel center mass and pull the trigger\" -- is in fact Clarke\u2019s advice to citizens. He says a 911 call isn\u2019t \u00a0always possible and by itself isn\u2019t effective because of long wait times for police.\nWhen we asked Clarke to respond to the ad, he said he stands behind what he said to Project Veritas and did not intend to watch the Greater Wisconsin ad.\nClarke said he suspected the ad twisted his remarks, but he couldn\u2019t recall the specific context of his comments in the interview cited in the ad, and he offered no specific criticisms.\n\"My position is clear,\" Clarke said."}

But are they inadvertently hurting the public by not sharing their technology with other pharmaceutical companies to help speed up vaccine manufacturing and distribution?\nThat\u2019s what one post circulating on social media claims.\n\"The vaccine shortage doesn\u2019t need to exist,\" reads an image of a tweet shared thousands of times on Facebook. \"Pfizer and Moderna could share their design with dozens of other pharma companies who stand ready to produce their vaccines and end the pandemic.\"\nIn short, the situation is not that simple. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis tweet doesn\u2019t mention that the two pharmaceutical companies are already partnering with other firms to produce the vaccine. It also makes it appear as if dozens of companies are regulated to make vaccines and have a ready supply of the raw materials, equipment and storage needed to efficiently and effectively produce them. Experts say that\u2019s not the case.\nWhen PolitiFact reached out to the tweet\u2019s author, Dr. James Hamblin, a public health policy lecturer at Yale University and writer at The Atlantic, he acknowledged that using the words \"stand ready\" in the tweet inaccurately implied the process could begin immediately.\n\"It takes time and investment to begin making mRNA vaccines,\" Hamblin told PolitiFact. \"The companies would need the assurance that they not lose money by getting into that space, possibly in some way similar to the assurances given during the research phase of warp speed.\"\nVaccine technology narrows the field\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s vaccines rely on newer messenger RNA technology. (It has been studied for some time, but hasn\u2019t been used in a vaccine until now.) The mRNA is fragile and needs to be handled carefully, with specific temperatures and humidity levels to keep it from breaking down.\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely, experts say, that \"dozens\" of manufacturing plants have the capability to get this type of production off the ground immediately. Even if Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna made their vaccine designs open source today, pharmaceutical researchers estimate that it would still take several months for other companies to produce the shots, and by then mass distribution and inoculation will be well underway.\nPolitiFact reached out to both companies for comment but did not hear back.\nDr. Rajeev Venkayya \u2014 president of the Global Vaccine Business Unit at Takeda Pharmaceuticals and former director of vaccine delivery at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s Global Health Program \u2014 wrote a Twitter thread addressing the complexity and risk of vaccine manufacturing.\nAmong many issues, Venyakka said that vaccines are complex biologics and it\u2019s hard to predict whether changes to the manufacturing process will impact vaccine efficacy or safety.\n\"Many vaccines are made by growing viruses in cells, and when that doesn\u2019t happen as expected, it can lead to losses in production and delayed timelines. This is an area where cell- and virus-free mRNA vaccine production has a major advantage,\" Venkayya wrote.\n\"For these reasons, every aspect of vaccine manufacturing is tightly controlled: raw materials, equipment, production processes, training, operating procedures etc. All of it happens under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) regulations, and facilities are regularly inspected.\"\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers may share any information or data about their products as they choose, as they are the owners of the information. But the firm is responsible for ensuring that any contract manufacturer is in compliance with the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations.\nThese rules establish minimum requirements for the methods, facilities and controls used in making and packing pharmaceuticals. They aim to ensure that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have.\nExisting partnerships are already speeding production\nJohn Grabenstein, associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition \u2014 a vaccine information organization that works in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014\u00a0 told PolitiFact the tweet wrongly presumes that the companies aren\u2019t already outsourcing production. Grabenstein tracks the partnerships between pharmaceutical firms and contract manufacturers.\nHe said that Pfizer-BioNTech is currently working with bio-pharmaceutical companies Rentschler and Polymun, while Moderna has partnered with Rovi, Recipharm and Lonza. Some of the companies are located entirely overseas, while others have plants in the U.S.\nTypically, the contractors are doing one of the major portions of production, Grabenstein said, such as manufacturing the bulk product, formulation of the bulk into the final preparation, filling the drug product into vials, or finishing the final packaging which could include labeling vials, inserting them and paperwork into boxes and assembling boxes for a carton.\nFor example, Rovi, one of the companies working with Moderna, signed a contract in July 2020 to start filling and packaging 100 million doses of the vaccine in early 2021.\nIn fewer cases, a full-fledged manufacturer is commissioned to make a mirror image of the original product, from start to finish.\nOne example of this is the Serum Institute of India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer \u2014 which is already producing a parallel version of the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine that the institute will market with the trade name CoviShield. The institute launched construction of new facilities back in June 2020 to make it happen. The organization recently announced a similar partnership with Novavax.\n\"This is incredibly intricate and the number of facilities and trained personnel is really, really small,\" Grabenstein said. \"It\u2019s not like you\u2019re just giving a recipe to another restaurant. That \u2018recipe\u2019 is thousands and thousands of pages long, and then you have to validate and show that you meet all the really tight performance specifications and prove consistency of process before any of the regulators will let you distribute any of the vaccine.\"\nHamblin, the author of the Twitter post, said it\u2019s unlikely that the companies would share their vaccine designs, given the current system of intellectual property and funding, though he noted exceptions, like Sanofi.\nSanofi, a French multinational pharmaceutical company, announced in January that it entered into a partnership with BioNTech, the firm that co-developed the vaccine with Pfizer. Sanofi said it will provide the firm access to its \"established infrastructure and expertise to produce over 125 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in Europe.\" Initial supplies will originate from Sanofi\u2019s production facilities in Frankfurt from summer of 2021.\nHamblin noted that if vaccine makers open the intellectual property in a permanent, unconditional way \u2014 rather than on a small scale for a finite period \u2014 it could help get more companies and governments into the production \"in a more permanent, cost-effective way.\"\n\"If we have to manufacture boosters in specific areas for new strains, for example, or for the next coronavirus, we could be on it right away,\" Hamblin said. \"Again, speaking hypothetically about that \u2014 not implying it will happen or would be quick or easy or anything else.\"\nDefense Production Act allows greater collaboration but takes time\nWith President Joe Biden invoking the Defense Production Act, couldn\u2019t that serve to help speed things up? Yes, but it\u2019s not as sweeping as some think.\nThe Defense Production Act of 1950 gives presidential authority to promote national defense by expediting and expanding the supply of materials and services from the U.S. industrial base.\nGeorge Siber, a vaccine expert who is on the advisory board of CureVac, a German mRNA vaccine company, told Kaiser Health News that invoking the act would allow the government to commandeer an appropriate plant to expand production, but said it would still take about a year to get going.\nCompanies would first have to undertake a thorough cleaning of their equipment and facilities to prevent cross-contamination and would need to set up, calibrate and test equipment, and train scientists and engineers to run it, Siber told KHN.\n\"Do you want glass? Aluminum? Filter resins? What is the thing that you need?\" Grabenstein said. \"For example, vaccine manufacturers say, \u2018if only I had more glass vials, I could increase my weekly production.\u2019 Ok, the government gets you more glass vials. Then it reveals the next bottleneck.\"\nHe added: \"Is there production that could be stopped or delayed, and let those machines be used for this goal? Sure, but you still have to clean it, and quality control that it\u2019s really clean, and then the transfer and validation of process. It\u2019s months or years of commitment. This is not turn-on-a-dime kind of stuff.\"\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 59 million doses of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines had been distributed and roughly 41 million administered by the second week in February.\nThis shows that the U.S. has vaccinated 9.5% of the population, putting it about fifth in the world, according to a tracker maintained by The New York Times."}

So we rate his statement True.","full_article":"Shortly after the Trump administration said it would slap tariffs on metals from the European Union, Canada and Mexico, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., released a tersely worded statement on the looming \"trade war.\"\n\"This is dumb. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don\u2019t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We\u2019ve been down this road before \u2014 blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression,\"\n\u00a0Sasse's statement said. \" 'Make America Great Again' shouldn\u2019t mean 'Make America 1929 Again.'\u00a0\"\nDoes Sasse have his history right when he says, \"We\u2019ve been down this road before \u2014 blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression\"? He does, as we\u2019ve recounted previously.\nThe Smoot-Hawley tariffs\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, you\u2019ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found.\nIn a career-making scene, Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.)\nHere\u2019s the part that\u2019s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here):\n\"In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression.\"\nStein\u2019s monologue pretty much tracks with what Sasse said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got worse.\nSpecifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 \u2014 sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. \u2014 raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. It was signed on June 17, 1930, or seven and a half months after Wall Street\u2019s \"Black Tuesday\" on Oct. 29, 1929.\nThe Smoot-Hawley tariffs, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own.\nSeveral economists and historians who studied the period told us the Stein-Sasse version of events is\u00a0quite accurate.\nExpert opinions\nDouglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said there was \"no real reason\" to impose the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and that it was mainly done for \"domestic political reasons.\" In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists.\n\"Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression,\" Irwin said, but he added that it\u2019s fair to say it made the depression \"longer and more painful.\"\nAfter the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports.\n\"Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump,\" Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that \"if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time.\"\nIndeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That\u2019s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office.\nAs a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies\u2019 efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan.\nThis isn\u2019t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression.\n\"Economists today debate the tariffs\u2019 effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small,\" said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century.\nFor instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade.\nStill, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren\u2019t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression, the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It\u2019s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said.\n\"It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism,\" said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. \"However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression.\""}

Therefore, all these questions are, at bottom, about when you are authorized to use deadly force against another person,\" said Frank Bowman III of the University of Missouri.\nUsing force is generally permissible to defend yourself from another person\u2019s wrongful use of force against you, but it has to be proportionate, said Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson and University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt.\n\"In particular, deadly force is not allowed unless it\u2019s a response to a threat of death or great bodily harm. Hitting someone with a car is deadly force. So, the question would be at what point would a motorist reasonably believe they were threatened with death or serious injury. Just blocking the road is clearly not enough, though,\" Roosevelt said.\nThe law generally would not permit a driver to plow through a group of protesters who were blocking the road and were banging on windows, threatening and trying to get in the vehicle, said University of Wyoming law professor George Mocsary and Keith Findley, who teaches law at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\"Stepping on the gas and plowing through a group of people would almost certainly cause death or great bodily harm to probably numerous people. The threat of imminent death or great bodily harm would have to be more real than that,\" Findley said.\nThe question is whether the driver of the car reasonably thought he or she was about to be killed or suffer serious harm unless the car moved, said Vanderbilt University\u2019s Christopher Slobogin, and whether the driver was reasonable in thinking that anyone hit by the car \"was threatening such harm or would not be seriously hurt by it.\"\nOne circumstance that potentially stands out is if a person forced their way into your car and you feared for your life, said Bowman.\u00a0 Some states have \"no retreat\" or \"make my day\" laws that authorize use of deadly force against those who unlawfully enter property, sometimes including vehicles. But the driver\u2019s use of force must be proportionate to any threat, he said."}

John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence.\"\nPaul definitely has a point. Adams\u2019 writings clearly show that he believed the writs of assistance case was a key, early turning point of the revolution that began 15 years later. But even if it was one cause, it wasn\u2019t the only one. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","full_article":"During the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky stood out a bit when he cited America\u2019s second president.\nIt came during a heated exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about how much government intrusiveness was needed to keep Americans safe from terrorism.\n\"I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans,\" said Paul, who has been a leading voice in his party for privacy from government intrusion. \"The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.\"\nTaken in its most literal interpretation, this claim doesn\u2019t make much sense, since the Fourth Amendment was ratified in 1791, about a decade and a half after the American Revolution began. But it\u2019s pretty clear that Paul means that the issues embedded in the Fourth Amendment were a factor in the revolution, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re checking.\nDid Adams say the Fourth Amendment was \"the spark that led to our war for independence?\"\nFor those who have forgotten what they learned in high-school civics class, the Fourth Amendment reads as follows:\n\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\nFrom looking at the documents and checking with experts, it appears that Paul is basically correct in saying that Adams felt this way, though the second president never actually used the word \"spark\" himself.\nThis goes back to the use of \"writs of assistance\" or general standing warrants that gave British law enforcement officials in Massachusetts -- Adams\u2019 home state -- wide powers to inspect the property and possessions of colonists in order to root out the proceeds of smuggling. These warrants were long-lasting -- up to six months after the death of the issuing sovereign -- and they permitted officials to enter any house during the day. They did not require officials to obtain a more specific permission from a judge -- what would today be called a search warrant.\nNot surprisingly, many colonists saw these broad governmental powers as onerous. The issue came to a head in 1761, when a Boston lawyer, James Otis Jr., led a group seeking redress from the court. Otis and his fellow complainants lost the case, but their arguments made a deep impression on Adams, then a 25-year-old lawyer who was in the courtroom when the case was heard.\nTwo documents show the significance of this case in Adams\u2019 mind. One was a letter to his wife, Abigail, on July 3, 1776 -- 15 years later, and the day before the signing of the Declaration of Independence:\n\"When I look back to the Year 1761, and recollect the Argument concerning Writs of Assistance, in the Superiour Court, which I have hitherto considered as the Commencement of the Controversy, between Great Britain and America, and run through the whole Period from that Time to this, and recollect the series of political Events, the Chain of Causes and Effects, I am surprized at the Suddenness, as well as Greatness of this Revolution.\"\nThe second document was a letter Adams wrote to his former student, William Tudor, in 1817, more than half a century after the court arguments. Tudor was assembling Otis\u2019 papers posthumously.\n\"Every Man of an immense crouded Audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take Arms against Writs of Assistants. Then and there was the first scene of the first Act of opposition to the Arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the Child Independence was born. In fifteen years i.e. in 1776. he grew up to Manhood, & declared himself free.\"\nWhile some sources imply that Adams himself used the term \"spark,\" such as a Heritage Foundation guide to the Constitution, it was actually his grandson, Charles Francis Adams, who did.\nIn 1856, Adams\u2019 grandson published a biography of the second president. In it, the grandson wrote, \"In the year 1761, arose the question respecting the legality of writs of assistance, argued before the superior court of the province, by James Otis, and which Mr. Adams himself considered as the spark in which originated the American Revolution. \u2026 \u00a0No man can attentively read it without observing, in the argument, the seeds profusely scattered of the Revolution of Independence.\"\nSo Paul is generally correct about the centrality of the Otis case for Adams, even if Adams himself never used the word \"spark.\"\nWas the Fourth Amendment \"what we fought the Revolution over\"?\nAccording to experts we contacted, concerns about searches and seizures are more accurately described as one of the causes of the American Revolution, rather than \"what we fought the Revolution over.\"\n\"The origins and issues over which the American Revolution was fought are complex, varied, and to this day, even among historians, debatable,\" said Amanda M. Norton, assistant editor of the Adams Papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society. While Adams did credit Otis\u2019\u00a0argument, whether or not he was correct on that point \"is a matter of debate.\"\nSerena Zabin, a Carleton College historian who specializes in the revolutionary era, agreed. \"It\u2019s a gross oversimplification to say that the American Revolution as a whole was fought over search and seizure. Other key factors certainly include the British Empire trying to control white settlers from taking native Indian land, political arguments over economic regulations, and eventually a rising series of provocations and complaints on both sides.\"\nThe best place to look for a list of causes of the revolution is the Declaration of Independence, added Brian Murphy, an early-American historian at Baruch College of the City University of New York. These include the king\u2019s refusal to acknowledge representative government, his close control of the judiciary, the forced quartering of British soldiers, the imposition of taxes without consent, and the provoking of Indian insurrections against the colonists, among many others cited in the founding document.\n\"The British lost the colonies through some very stupid, unforced errors, and (search and seizure) is one of those things,\" Murphy said.\nWhen we contacted Paul\u2019s campaign, spokeswoman Eleanor May said that Paul didn\u2019t claim that the Fourth Amendment was the only cause of the American Revolution.\n\"Sen. Paul stands by his statement, though he encourages every American to read the work of John Adams and our other Founding Fathers and draw their own conclusions,\" May said."}

Finland\u2019s police training takes longer than two years, and it had two more police-related deaths. The claims about U.S. policing were the most inaccurate. Police academies and departments usually require more than 21 weeks of training and estimates for fatal police shootings point to about 20,000 deaths in the past 20 years.\nWhat\u2019s missing most from the post, however, is context. The rate of gun violence and gun ownership is higher in the U.S. than in these other countries. Research has also shown that fatal police shootings are the result of a combination of factors and are not limited to time spent in police training alone. Experts say there needs to be structural U.S. policing reform, not just more time spent intraining.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nCorrection, June 22, 2020:Finland has a high homicide rate compared to mostNordic countries, but it does not have the highest homicide rate in Europe.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s been around for at least a couple of years; Snopes checked this same claim and image in 2018.\nWe looked at training and gun-related deaths and found that while the numbers for the Nordic countries are largely accurate, the numbers fall apart when we get to the U.S. statistics. And while the overall claim that the U.S. has less police training and more civilian deaths at the hands of police is accurate, this idea falls short in that it presumes a direct link between police training and fatal civilian encounters and does not take into consideration additional factors like each country\u2019s gun culture.\nThe numbers in context\nThe U.S. has more gun violence than any other large, wealthy country and ranks the 28th-highest rate of gun violence in the world, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The U.S. also has the highest concentration of guns owned by civilians, with 120.5 guns for every 100 residents. The second highest rate of gun ownership is in Yemen with 52.8 guns for every 100 residents. Iceland and Finland are in the top ten gun-owning countries, with a little over 30 guns for every 100 residents.\nFinland has the 11th highest rate of intentional homicides in Europe, which is considered average compared to other European countries but high for a Nordic country. However, in 2017, the U.S. homicide rate was four times the homicide rate in Finland. And, as of 2015,\u00a0the U.S. gun-related homicide rate was more than four times\u00a0Finland's.\u00a0Iceland hasn\u2019t had a gun-related civilian murder since 2007. And while Norway is known for having a high gun-owning rate, it has a low rate of gun violence compared to the rest of Europe.\nIn a Washington Post article on police shootings, leading criminologist Geoffrey Alpert described how researchers struggle to pinpoint why the U.S. has had so many fatal police shootings.\u00a0 \"We\u2019ve looked at this data in so many ways, including whether race, geography, violent crime, gun ownership or police training can explain it,\" he said. \"But none of those factors alone can explain how consistent this number appears to be.\"\nGeorge Washington Law Professor Cynthia Lee in the 2018 University of Illinois Law Review wrote that \"only a multiplicity of reforms\" will reduce fatal police shootings and lead to \"lasting structural changes in policing.\"\nNorway claims are correct\nThe claim that Norway requires three years of training and has had four people killed since 2002\u00a0 is accurate.\nAccording to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which calls itself the world\u2019s largest regional security organization, basic police training in Norway includes a three-year college education at the Norwegian Police University College. Trainees study at the college in their first and third years and spend their second year in on-the-ground training.\nThe Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs releases annual reports on police encounters they have investigated and articles on policing trends. In 2014, the report included an article on police shootings. In all 15 police shootings the bureau had investigated \"16 persons have been injured\u2026 and, in two of these cases, the injuries resulted in death.\"\nA European news network called The Local reported in 2016 that there had been a fatal police shooting in 2015 and another in 2016 that marked \"the fourth time that police in Norway have been involved in a fatal shooting since 2002.\"\nThe Norwegian Bureau for the Investigation of Police Affairs\u2019 most recent report was from 2018 and it doesn\u2019t list any fatal shootings. Searching recent news, we couldn\u2019t find another story on fatal police shootings in Norway from 2019 or 2020.\nFinland claims are a little off\nThe claim that Finland requires two years of training and has seven people killed since 2000 is a bit off. The country\u2019s police training program takes more than two years, and there is a little more information to be considered when calculating the number of deaths.\nLike Norway, Finland\u2019s Police University College has a policing bachelors program. It requires students to complete 180 credit points, which usually takes three years to complete, not two like the post claims.\nSnopes reviewed and shared a list of 2000-18 police-related fatalities from the Finland National Police Board. Contacted by PolitIFact, Liisa Haapanen, the board\u2019s senior communication adviser, verified the accuracy of the list and said that the numbers have not changed.\nThe list details nine police-related fatalities, including a 2012 case in which a person died after an officer deployed a Taser; the report says it is unclear how electric shocks contributed to his death. The report also includes a 2010 incident in which a security guard was fatally shot after a police officer \"accidentally discharged\" their weapon.\nIceland claims are accurate\nThe post\u2019s claim that Iceland requires two years of training and that one person has been killed is right. Iceland has very little violent crime.\nIceland\u2019s police university, the University of Akureyri, offers a bachelor's degree for police and law enforcement that has a two-year schedule.\nIn 2013, Iceland\u2019s first-ever fatal police shooting generated a lot of media coverage. The police department apologized to the victim\u2019s family. The Reykjav\u00edk Police chief said the event would be thoroughly investigated and the police officers involved received grief counseling.\n\u00c1sgeir Sverrisson, The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, verified with PolitiFact that the 2013 shooting was the only fatal police shooting in Iceland\u2019s history but that there have been instances in which citizens died in police custody or following police confrontations.\nU.S. claims are mostly inaccurate\nThis Facebook\u2019s most misleading claims come when it summarizes police training and officer-involved fatalities in the U.S. It says the U.S. requires 21 weeks of training and has experienced \"8,000+ people killed since 2001.\" The best data suggest a number far higher than 8,000.\nWhere the post has a point is that initial U.S. police training requirements are shorter than in these Nordic countries.\nU.S. police academies vary. A 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics review found that from 2011 to 2013, most academy training lasts \"an average of about 840 hours, or 21 weeks.\"\nNearly all police officers completed a mandatory field training after their basic training according to that 2013 report. About 37% of field training programs are organized by academies that require an average of 500 additional hours, or over 12 weeks, to complete field training. Based on these numbers, police officers have an average of 33 weeks of training.\nBased on that 2016 report, U.S. police officers are trained for almost eight months, and about three months of that training is in the field.\nThe bigger problem in analyzing the post is that there are only estimates for the number of people killed by police.\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics recorded arrest-related deaths from 2003-09. During that seven-year period, there were 4,813 reported deaths from \"law enforcement personnel attempting to arrest or restrain\" citizens. About 60% of those deaths, 2,931 of them, were ruled a homicide. There is no data in the report that indicates how many of these were gun-related.\nThough the FBI in 2019 launched the National Use-of-Force Data Collection effort, law enforcement agencies are not required to participate and the FBI has not yet released any findings.\nThe Washington Post in 2015 started recording fatal shooting victims and found that police have shot and killed about 5,400 people in the five years since \u2014 roughly 1,000 people a year.\nFatal Encounters, a database created by a journalist, tracks deaths of people killed by law enforcement with crowd-sourced information and paid researchers, using public records and news reports. The database lists over 28,000 people who have been killed while interacting with law enforcement since 2000. About 20,300 were the result of firearms."}

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nIt\u2019s accurate that Lee was offered to command the Union Army and turned it down despite his desire for the country to remain intact, citing loyalty to his home state of Virginia.\nLee made some mixed statements about his feelings toward slavery, particuarly nearing the end of the war, but his actions and political positions contradict the idea that he opposed it.\n\"Robert E. Lee did oppose secession. On that point, there is no dispute. Lee's attitudes toward slavery, however, are more complex than the statement that \u2018he opposed slavery\u2019 suggests,\" W. Fitzhugh Brundage, professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, told PolitiFact in an email.\n\"What is clear is that Lee did not oppose slavery to the degree that he was willing to take any meaningful steps against the institution. Finally, during the Civil War Lee used his army in various ways to bolster and sustain the institution of slavery. So while Lee never endorsed slavery as a positive good (a la James Henry Hammond) he got no further than wringing his hands over the institution and lamenting its existence. After the Civil War he displayed clear hostility to black equality of any kind.\"\nLee personally enslaved people who he inherited after his mother died in 1829. Then, in 1857, following the death of his father-in-law, Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people working between the two estates. Interestingly, Lee\u2019s father-in-law specified in his will that all the family\u2019s slaves be freed within five years of his death.\nSean Kane, the American Civil War Museum\u2019s former interpretation and programs specialist, wrote in an article that Lee, as executor of the will, \"drove his new-found labor force hard to lift those estates from debt,\" and, concerned it would take longer than five years, \"petitioned state courts to extend his control of enslaved people.\" That didn\u2019t happen, as Lee freed them in accordance with the will in 1862 (and three days before the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect).\nWhile his actions and slave-owning practices suggest he supported slavery, some of Lee\u2019s writings offer a more muddled view.\nPrior to the Civil War, on Dec. 27, 1856, Lee wrote to his wife: \"In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.\"\nBut he goes on to say that slavery was \"a greater evil to the white man than to the black race\" and \"while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former.\" Lee wrote that African Americans were \"immeasurably better off\" in the U.S. than in Africa and that the \"painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race.\"\nEric Foner, a Civil War historian and Columbia University professor, referred us to a passage he wrote on Lee\u2019s connection with slavery in the New York Times Book Review:\n\"During his lifetime, Lee owned a small number of slaves. He considered himself a paternalistic master but could also impose severe punishments, especially on those who attempted to run away. Lee said almost nothing in public about the institution. His most extended comment, quoted by all biographers, came in a letter to his wife in 1856. Here he described slavery as an evil, but one that had more deleterious effects on whites than blacks. He felt that the \u2018painful discipline\u2019 to which they were subjected benefitted blacks by elevating them from barbarism to civilization and introducing them to Christianity. The end of slavery would come in God's good time, but this might take quite a while, since to God a thousand years was just a moment. Meanwhile, the greatest danger to the \u2018liberty\u2019 of white southerners was the \u2018evil course\u2019 pursued by the abolitionists, who stirred up sectional hatred. In 1860, Lee voted for John C. Breckenridge, the extreme proslavery candidate (a more moderate southerner, John Bell, carried Virginia that year).\"\n\"I would not say that this qualifies Lee as \u2018against slavery,\u2019\" Foner added in the email.\nJohn Reeves, author of \"The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee\" wrote a post on some of the most popular myths attributed to the general \u2014 the first being Lee\u2019s opposition to slavery.\nReeves explains that after losing the war, Lee attempted to present himself as always being against slavery. In an interview after his surrender, Reeves says, Lee said that \"the best men of the South\" were eager to do away with it, and in a testimony in 1866 he had \"always been in favor of emancipation \u2014 gradual emancipation.\"\nBut Reeves writes that the historical record doesn\u2019t support these statements, as Lee and his family owned and managed slaves for decades and benefited \"tremendously\" from the institution."}

Schools can receive a grade of A, B, C, D, F or I (incomplete).\nBaker\u2019s evidence for his statement is based on the grades of elementary schools included in his \"Mayor's, Mentors and More\" program, which included the majority of elementary schools in St. Petersburg starting in 2001. The program included initiatives such as scholarships, corporate partnerships and business mentoring.\nBaker spokeswoman Brigitta Shouppe said schools that had 51 percent of their students living in the city of St. Petersburg were included in the program, ranging from 27 to 30 schools each year.\nAccording to the state data, there were zero A elementary schools from that group in 2001.\nAt the end of Baker's last full year in office in 2009, the number of A elementary schools had jumped dramatically to 16. The number of A and B total schools (not just elementary schools) went from seven in July 2001 to 26 in July 2009. That\u2019s an increase of about 271 percent.\nThe improvement in A-rated schools was not a steady build; the number fluctuated year to year.\nThe education department made significant changes to the grading system between 2001 and 2009, so schools were not graded based on the exact same criteria over the eight-year period.\n\"In the past the department has shown grades over time but has generally also pointed out the changes made from one year to the next,\" said Audrey Walden, Florida Department of Education spokeswoman.\nSchool improvement takes a village\nAs Baker acknowledged, a mayor can only do so much when it comes to local education. The school board sets local education policy and the superintendent carries it out.\nIn an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Baker stressed again that the gains were a team effort.\n\"It\u2019s great for the St. Pete schools to have an advocate in the mayor\u2019s office and do it in partnership with the School's Board and the school system,\" Baker said.\nJulie Mastry (formerly Julie Janssen), who was Pinellas County superintendent from 2008-11 and deputy superintendent from 2006-08, said the school board and Baker\u2019s office had a \"healthy partnership.\"\nCurrent Pinellas County School Board member Rene Flowers served on St. Petersburg City Council for a potion of Baker\u2019s term and was clear that she supports Mayor Rick Kriseman in this election.\nShe said \"the mayor has nothing to do\" with daily operations in county schools.\n\"School reform is complex, and it is hard to attribute improvement to one program or source,\" said Alyson Adams, a clinical associate professor of education at the University of Florida.\nAdams said that it\u2019s possible Baker\u2019s mentoring program put a greater focus on learning, but added there may also be other programs happening in these schools that contributed to the improvements.\nBaker\u2019s tenure did not see as much of the effects of the School Board\u2019s vote in December 2007 to end integration and create neighborhood schools. (Baker said he did not have a position on that.) The decision and a lack of follow-up with resources by the board created a concentration of poverty in schools in St. Petersburg's black neighborhoods. The Tampa Bay Times documented the outcome of five elementary schools in its \"Failure Factories\" investigation."}

With regard to ICE, Kaine has rebuked controversial raiding tactics practiced under the Trump administration, but he has not called for the agency\u2019s termination.\n\"Tim believes we need comprehensive immigration reform and strongly supported legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 to create a path to citizenship and fund border security,\" said a statement on the immigration page of Kaine\u2019s campaign website.\nThe 2013 bill, for which Kaine delivered a Senate floor speech in Spanish, was the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, and it passed the Senate by a 68-32 vote. Although it ultimately died in the House, the bill would have increased the number of federal agents along the U.S. border with Mexico, required construction of 700 miles of border fencing and allocated money for aerial drones, among other border security measures.\nThe bill also included provisions that would have allowed immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to adjust their immigration status so long as they satisfied certain criteria.\nLater, in February 2018, Kaine co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to protect Dreamers and enhance border security. In addition to providing legal status and a path to citizenship for people who arrived in the U.S. as children, the bill would have granted $25 billion in funding for Northern and Southern border security over a 10-year period.\n\"We\u2019ve reached a deal that gives us the best chance to protect Dreamers against deportation from the only country they know as home,\" Kaine said at the time. Ultimately, the proposal fell short of the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate after the Trump administration publicly opposed it.\n\"I think we do need to do more border control,\" Kaine said during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" in April 2018. \"I want to see a strategy \u2026 not just a president acting like the military was his palace guard and he could do whatever he wanted on a day in question.\"\nIan Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, pointed to the 2013 and 2018 bills as well as an op-ed Kaine wrote criticizing the Trump policy of separating families at the border.

Kay Ivey as the Republican nominee after the June 5 primary. Ivey, who stepped into the role after former Gov. Robert Bentley resigned, did not participate in the debate.\nOne AL.com reader asked the candidates, \"As the mom of a third grader who had a classmate say he would bring a gun to school, what will you be doing to keep our kids safe?\"\nHightower proposed placing police officers in schools so that they got to know students and prevent crime.\n\"We know who the difficult students are, more often than not, through their truancy and through their actions,\" Hightower said. \"In Mobile, it\u2019s something like, 1,700 families generate 80 percent of the crime. We know who those families are.\"\nMobile has a population of about 193,000. Is a small fraction of families generating a majority of crime?\nNot so fast.\nIt sounded like Hightower was talking about the outsized effects of organized crime in Mobile. But Hightower\u2019s campaign told us he was citing a statistic about school suspensions.\nThat statistic is 15 years old and is the latest study available.\nIn 2003, the Mobile County district attorney researched school suspensions and found that of the 65,000 students in the district, only 1,500 students were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of serious school infractions. The district attorney then cross-referenced the students with home addresses to identify 1,200 households.\nThe office did not study all of the reasons for a suspension, just those that were considered serious \u2014 such as burglary or having drugs or weapons on campus. John Tyson, the former district attorney who did the research, emphasized the behavior did not constitute crime under a criminal justice definition.\nTyson said there is not a similar data point for more recent years.\nStill, criminologists were not surprised by the finding.\n\"The general idea that a few people are engaged in a lot of problem behavior and criminal behavior makes a lot of sense and would be consistent with what we see with a lot of other types of crime,\" said Adam Lankford, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Alabama.\nSexual assault on campus came to mind, where the number of reported incidents often heavily outweighs the number of offenders.\n\"A small percentage of the population is responsible for a large percentage of crimes. The same is true of families as criminal behavior often runs within families,\" said James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University.\nLankford took issue with Hightower\u2019s description of the role of families. While social factors play a role in problematic behavior, the research identified correlation, not causation. It did not place blame on a small proportion of families for crime.\nIn fact, Tyson warned against using the word \"crime\" to describe the behavior, as the research looked at addressing school suspensions and absences to address potential future crime, not actual crime.\nTyson said the research was not very relevant for his office. But he did use it as a starting point for the ongoing Helping Families Initiative, which he continues to lead.\nThe initiative pairs K-12 public school students who are identified as at-risk for crime with law enforcement and community resources, such as child services, public health officials and domestic violence experts. The aim is to reduce misdemeanors committed on campus and other criminal acts.\nThe program is active in six districts, including Mobile."}

We're at 29.\"\nThe U.S. has hovered slightly above 29 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people in recent days, but it is far from being \"down near the low end of per capita deaths.\"\nOnly a handful of countries are performing worse by that metric, and just three have recorded more than 60 deaths per 100,000.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.","full_article":"On the day the U.S. topped 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, CNBC hosts Joe Kernen and Andrew Ross Sorkin shouted over each other about the threat of the virus and its impact on the stock market.\nAfter Kernen said Sorkin had panicked about the coronavirus and spooked investors, Sorkin accused Kernen of dismissing the virus as a way to defend President Donald Trump.\n\"You didn\u2019t panic about anything,\" Sorkin said during the May 27 dust-up on CNBC\u2019s \"Squawk Box.\" \"100,000 people died, Joe, and all you did was try to help your friend, the president.\"\nKernen responded that he has been trying to help investors \"keep their cool, keep their heads,\" adding that \"as it turned out, that\u2019s what they should\u2019ve done.\" Then he explained why.\n\"We\u2019re down near the low end of per capita deaths,\" Kernen said. \"\u2026 Most places are at 60 deaths per 100,000. We're at 29.\"\nThe next day, the two told viewers that they had made amends, with Sorkin saying they were \"having the conversation that\u2019s happening at everybody\u2019s dinner table.\"\nIn case you\u2019re having the same argument over dinner tonight, we wanted to arm you with the facts: Kernen\u2019s claim on deaths per capita isn\u2019t completely accurate.\nWhile the U.S. is close to 29 deaths per 100,000 people, it is not \"near the low end of per capita deaths,\" we found. Only a handful of countries have had more deaths per capita.\nRELATED: Trump\u2019s comparison of COVID-19 deaths in Germany, US is wrong\nThe numbers\nA CNBC spokesperson cited data from Johns Hopkins University tracking deaths per 100,000 people, a metric that public health experts generally consider useful.\nAs of May 26, the day before Kernen\u2019s claim, the U.S. had recorded 30.23 deaths per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins.\nThat was better than 10 countries. It was\u00a0worse than more than 130 others, including many nations of similar size.\nSpecifically, the U.S. had more deaths per 100,000 people at the time of Kernen\u2019s comment than all but a handful of European countries: San Marino, Belgium, Andorra, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland.\nOnly San Marino (pop. 34,000), Belgium (pop. 11.6 million) and Andorra (pop. 77,000) had more than 60 deaths per 100,000 people. Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy had over 50 deaths per 100,000.\nThose figures have hardly changed as of May 27. The U.S. is at 30.69 deaths per 100,000 people, behind the same 10 European nations but ahead of the rest.\nThree other sources public health experts told us are reliable \u2014 the Kaiser Family Foundation, Our World in Data and Worldometer \u2014 show similar numbers.\nEach source shows the U.S. performing worse than the vast majority of countries.\n\"We have a very high death rate here compared to most countries in the world, and some of our states have among the highest death rates in the world,\" said Brooke Nichols, assistant professor of global health at Boston University.\nThe U.S., in particular, is \"a patchwork epidemic\" because of its \"expansive, diverse geography and populations,\" Nichols said.\nDifferent geographic areas experience varying outbreaks and death tolls due to a number of factors, such as the age of the population, how far along the epidemic curve the area is and how well the local health care systems have been able to manage, she said.\nIf you compare individual U.S. states to other countries, Nichols said, the situation looks worse. Eleven states plus Washington, D.C have more deaths per million people than the U.S. as a whole, according to Worldometer data for May 28.\nSome states are comparable to the worst countries.\nAs we\u2019ve noted, another way to compare countries is to consider recent \u2014 rather than total \u2014 death counts per capita. But as of May 28, numerous countries have also had fewer daily deaths per capita based on a seven-day average than the U.S., per Our World in Data."}

Mark Walker, a Greensboro Republican, tweeted a thank you to President Trump on Nov. 27.\n\"Thank you @realDonaldTrump. These cartels endanger Americans and threaten our country\u2019s national security. The problem is so bad that @StateDept issued a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory to a Mexican state that has a 230m border with the US\u2013the same designation as Syria,\" Walker tweeted.\nWalker, who has 26,000 Twitter followers, tweeted his comments in reaction to a story about the U.S. designating drug cartels as terrorist groups. But Walker\u2019s claim \u2014 about a Mexican state having the same travel warning as Syria \u2014 isn\u2019t addressed by the New York Times story he tweeted.\nSo we wondered whether the claim by Walker was true. And, from our research, he\u2019s on-point.\nWe analyzed Walker\u2019s claim in three parts:\nDid the U.S. government issue a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for a Mexican state?\nDid the U.S. government issue the same travel advisory for Syria?\nAnd how long is that Mexican state\u2019s border with the U.S.?\nTravel advisories\nThe State Department labels the safety levels in foreign countries using a four-step scale:\n1- Exercise normal precautions.\n2- Exercise increased caution.\n3- Reconsider travel.\n4- Do not travel.\nThe State Department considers Mexico as a whole to be a Level 2 country, meaning travelers should \"exercise increased caution.\" The department also assigns advisory levels to individual states. Five states are at the \"do not travel\" level: Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas.\nA \u2018lawless\u2019 border state\nOnly one Level 4 state, Tamaulipas, shares a border with the United States. And it is known for being dangerous.\nThe Associated Press has described the Tamaulipas as a \"lawless border state.\" The state department website says this about the area:\n\"Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common. Gang activity, including gun battles and blockades, is widespread. Armed criminal groups target public and private passenger buses as well as private automobiles traveling through Tamaulipas, often taking passengers hostage and demanding ransom payments.\"\nAs it turns out, Tamaulipas has the same travel advisory as Syria.\nLength of the border\nWalker\u2019s tweet about the length of the border \u2014 230m \u2014 might give readers pause. The letter \"m\" is an abbreviation for a meter of length. A meter is about 39 inches. So, at first glance, one might think Walker was referring to a border slightly longer than two football fields.\nBut, given the U.S. isn\u2019t on the metric system, it\u2019s more likely that Walker was referring to miles. And indeed that was the case, according to spokesman Jack Minor.\n(Quick fact: the correct abbreviation for a mile is \"mi,\" according to Dictionary.com.)\nAsked for the source of Walker\u2019s information, Minor emailed a link to a 2012 McClatchy DC story, \"Along Mexico border, drug taint on politicians lingers.\"\nThe second paragraph describes Tamaulipas as \"a muggy Gulf Coast state that shares a 230-mile border with Texas and is a major conduit for licit and illicit trade.\" And that length estimate checks out. A page found on the Mexican government website describes the Tamaulipas-U.S. border as being 370 kilometers, which is equal to 230 miles."}

But his description of the amendment was a bit misleading, since anyone convicted of a felony for a sex crime was already prioritized for deportation.\nEllmers has also long said she voted against the bill due to fears that it would lead to less reporting of domestic violence. That\u2019s a key piece of context that was missing from Holding\u2019s assessment of her record.\nWe rate this claim Half True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/a5a4c9e6-33ac-4988-8016-3a5a41cb3c5d","full_article":"In their first debate, three candidates for the Republican nomination for North Carolina\u2019s U.S. House District 2 squared off last week on who deserves to represent the area in Washington, D.C.\nThe district was recently redrawn to include most of the suburban Wake County areas around Raleigh as well as all or part of the more rural Harnett, Johnston, Wilson, Nash and Franklin counties. In an oddity created by the new boundaries, two of the primary candidates are incumbents now fighting for the same seat.\nThroughout the debate, Rep. George Holding attempted to paint himself as a staunch conservative who won\u2019t budge on controversial issues. Rep. Renee Ellmers attempted to paint herself as a more pragmatic conservative who would rather get things done.\nThat fight was perhaps most apparent in a back-and-forth on immigration policy. Holding accused Ellmers of being too liberal in a 2015 vote.\n\"We had an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants,\" Holding said. \"Mrs. Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against that amendment.\"\nIt\u2019s true that Ellmers was the only Republican to vote no on that particular amendment, which was tacked onto a bill regarding Department of Homeland Security funding. She was also one of 10 Republicans who voted against the bill as a whole.\nHowever, the amendment in question did more than just prioritize the deportation of dangerous sexual criminals. It also would\u2019ve prioritized people convicted of domestic violence or less serious, misdemeanor sexual crimes.\nAnd it was because of fears over unintended consequences of those extra provisions \u2013 which Holding neglected to mention \u2013 that Ellmers has long said she voted no.\nImmediately after the 2015 vote, Ellmers said in an interview with McClatchy\u2019s D.C. bureau that she opposed it because it \"may remove protections for victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse.\"\nThat was the same stance taken by the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\nBoth groups urged a \u2018No\u2019 vote, saying the amendment would lead to domestic and sexual violence going unreported.\n\"Victims of domestic violence often do not seek help when they know that the consequences to the perpetrator (for example, a spouse or parent, or perhaps other family member) may result in the perpetrator\u2019s deportation,\" the task force wrote to members of Congress. \"This often takes place due to their financial dependence, and even close relationship to the perpetrator.\"\nThe bishops agreed, writing: \"While presented as a measure that helps domestic violence victims, we fear that it actually would discourage many such victims from reporting abuse.\"\nThe amendment and the bill as a whole passed the House despite that opposition. But the amendment in question was removed by the Senate, which passed the bill and sent the new version back to the House, which approved it even though it didn\u2019t include the amendment. President Obama then signed the bill into law.\nThat chain of events led Ellmers, during the recent debate, to shoot back at Holding.\n\"That amendment was completely meaningless, and you know it was,\" she said.\nAnd even though Holding brought up sexual criminals, the amendment would have changed nothing for the most egregious offenders. Undocumented immigrants who commit felonies \u2013 including serious sexual crimes like rape \u2013 were already given top priority for deportation.\nEllmers referenced that in the debate: \"As far as deporting those who are the worst offenders \u2013 those illegal immigrants who are pedophiles \u2013 my goodness, are we not doing that now?\"\nIt was a rhetorical question. But according to the government, we are indeed doing just that.\nIn 2014, the Department of Homeland Security listed its highest priorities for deportation: convicted of a felony, convicted of gang-related crimes, caught at the border or suspected of being a terrorist or spy.\nAn Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report on the 2015 fiscal year said 98 percent of the 235,413 people deported that year met one of its criteria or were otherwise considered a threat to public safety.\nAt the debate, Ellmers also said she voted no because she thought Republicans should have worked with Democrats to find a compromise instead of letting President Obama set the country\u2019s immigration policy while Congress remains in a boondoggle.\n\"I find it interesting that we are still in a place where we are having this conversation about what we are not getting done,\" Ellmers said."}

The system releases two types of warnings to the American public: alerts and bulletins. Alerts, which are issued when DHS has \"specific, credible\" information about a terror threat, are the more serious and urgent of the two. Bulletins communicate \"general trends\" that could potentially escalate into threats of terrorism.\nThe Aug. 13 bulletin warned of a \"current heightened threat environment across the United States,\" citing the 20th anniversary of 9\/11 and other forces, including threats posed by \"domestic terrorists, individuals and groups engaged in grievance-based violence, and those inspired or motivated by foreign terrorists and other malign foreign influences.\" It continued:\n\"These actors are increasingly exploiting online forums to influence and spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity. Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions.\"\nIt said that violent extremists who are \"racially- or ethnically-motivated\" or \"anti-government\/anti-authority\" remain a national threat priority, and warned they \"may seek to exploit the potential re-establishment of public health restrictions as a rationale to conduct attacks.\"\nIt also warned that \"domestic violent extremists\" have been introducing and amplifying online narratives that promote violence, including \"continued, non-specific calls for violence on multiple online platforms\" associated with such \"ideologies or conspiracy theories on perceived election fraud and alleged reinstatement, and responses to anticipated restrictions relating to the increasing COVID cases.\"\nNowhere does the advisory bulletin label all Trump supporters or conspiracy theorists terrorists. Nor did the bulletin add specific groups or individuals to existing lists of terror organizations. And it does not say that \"resisting COVID regulations\" and \"thinking the election was rigged\" amounts to terrorism.\nThe bulletin \"doesn\u2019t designate any individuals or groups as domestic terror organizations,\" said Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty & National Security Program. \"It is similar to statements by the director of national intelligence and the FBI that identify domestic terrorism as the principal threat facing the U.S. at this time and uses the same terminology.\"\nThe legal authority to officially designate groups as terrorists belongs to the U.S. departments of State and Treasury, not to the National Terrorism Advisory System. And that authority doesn\u2019t allow for American citizens to be designated as terrorists unless they are linked to a designated terrorist group based overseas, said Blazakis.\n\"There is no legal mechanism that exists to designate individuals who may be connected to groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and the like,\" he said."}

Randolph Bracy argues that Gov. Rick Scott overreached when he issued an order removing Orlando-area prosecutor Aramis D. Ayala from a high-profile prosecution of an accused cop killer after she said she would not pursue the death penalty in murder cases.\nBracy, an Orange County Democrat and chairman of the Florida Senate criminal justice committee, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that prosecutors have broad discretionary power.\n\"Although Ms. Ayala\u2019s critics have denounced her actions as dereliction of duty, they cannot point to a single law or statute that she has violated,\" he wrote in the April 4 op-ed. \"That\u2019s because she hasn\u2019t. There are no federal or state laws that say prosecutors must seek death sentences. And the United States Supreme Court has banned all state laws that make executions mandatory for murders.\"\nLegal experts told PolitiFact that Bracy is correct. Key court rulings about the death penalty forbid laws that force prosecutors to seek the death penalty.\nAyala, a Democrat elected as state attorney state attorney in Orange\u00a0and Osceola counties in 2016, announced in March that she would no longer seek the death penalty. \u00a0Her decision came while handling the case of Markeith Loyd, who is accused of killing Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton amid a manhunt for Loyd after he allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend.\nLaws about death penalty prosecutions\nIn 1972 in Furman vs. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty, finding lack of standards in enforcing the death penalty constituted \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" In response, many states then changed their laws. In 1976, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of new death sentencing laws in five cases from Georgia, Florida, Texas, \u00a0North Carolina, and Louisiana.\nIt was in these cases that the court struck down statutes that mandated death sentences while allowing the statutes to stand that required juries or judges to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Still, some states in the intervening years tried to pass laws that mandated the death penalty.\nIn 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court found all such laws unconstitutional, the \"last vestiges of the mandatory death penalty in the United States,\" the New York Times explained.\nIn addition to pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Bracy\u2019s legislative assistant Travaris McCurdy also pointed to Florida cases including an argument by Attorney General Pam Bondi in a death penalty appeal case, State vs. Perry. Bondi argued in a 2016 petition to the court that \"The Florida Supreme Court has recognized that the State has complete discretion in charging decisions, including the determination to charge and prosecute a capital case.\"\n(Bondi has called Ayala\u2019s actions a \"blatant neglect of duty and a shameful failure to follow the law.\")\nDue to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions, we have a discretionary system in which prosecutors and juries are supposed to evaluate the use of the death penalty case by case, said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which supports the death penalty.\nAnd Ayala isn\u2019t doing that, he said.\n\"For a prosecutor to make a blanket decision to prosecute all cases as capital or none of them is not exercising discretion that is supposed to be part of system,\" he said. \"Prosecutors are supposed to look at each case and decide if it is one of the exceptionally heinous cases that deserve the death penalty.\"\nSpokespersons for Scott and Bondi made some similar points about how prosecutors should evaluate the death penalty case by case.\n\"Gov. Scott has not said that prosecutors must seek death sentences,\" Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said. \"State Attorney Aramis Ayala was removed from the cases in the interest of justice following her public announcement to not consider capital punishment during her time in office, regardless of the individual facts and circumstances in any case.\"\nOn April 3, Scott removed Ayala, a Democrat, from 21 additional first-degree murder cases and reassigned them to Brad King, a Republican Ocala-based state attorney."}

It consists of 197 Parties (196 States and 1 regional economic integration organization). Among them are the United States, Syria and Nicaragua.\nThe UNFCCC\u2019s ultimate goal is \"preventing \u2018dangerous\u2019 human interference with the climate system,\" that includes greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the UNFCCC\u2019s website.\nParties to the UNFCCC during a December 2015 session in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement, seeking \"to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.\" One of the objectives is to hold the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\nA total of 175 parties signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, according to information from the UN. The agreement remained opened for signatures from April 22, 2016, to April 21, 2017.

Only seven of the Democrats remain in the Senate today.\nGillibrand\u2019s career\nGillibrand worked as a lawyer at a Manhattan law firm during Clinton\u2019s impeachment, then accepted a position as special counsel at the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development in 2000.

Bill Nelson.\nThe lead-in text above the video offers a hint that the reference was to past statements by Scott (emphasis ours): \"Rick Scott vowed to implement racial profiling laws in Florida and wanted to exclude Dreamers from citizenship.\"\nBut this attack amounts to cherry-picking. Scott softened his stance on illegal immigration years ago and does not have those positions anymore.\nDid Scott encourage racial profiling of immigrants?\nThis attack is misleading. The fine print shows it is in reference to a position Scott took during a GOP primary in 2010.\nThe video cites a sentence from a 2010 TIME magazine article about the Florida 2010 governor\u2019s race. It says, \"Scott favors Arizona\u2019s draconian anti-illegal-immigration law.\"\nScott did promise then to bring a law similar to Arizona\u2019s SB 1070 to Florida.\nThe 2010 Arizona law made being an undocumented immigrant a state crime and required legal immigrants to carry papers to confirm their legal status. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling, prompting state officials to add to the law that police \"may not consider race, color or national origin.\"\nScott argued in 2010 that the law wasn\u2019t racial profiling and said, \"I clearly don't believe in racial profiling.\"\nBut Scott never pushed for such a law after he was elected, breaking his promise.\nA spokesman for Priorities USA Action said the result shouldn\u2019t matter to people who saw the Facebook post.\n\"We say that he vowed to implement laws like Arizona,\" Priorities USA Action spokesman Josh Schwerin said. \"Just because he didn\u2019t get it done doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t pledge to do it.\"\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court found parts of the Arizona law unconstitutional but upheld the central requirement calling on officers to check the status of people they suspect were undocumented immigrants.\nExclude Dreamers from citizenship?\nThis attack zeroes in on Scott\u2019s statements against Dreamers early in his tenure. It, too, ignores that his more recent position is more favorable to this group of immigrants.\nDreamers are immigrants brought over to the U.S. illegally by their parents when they were children.\nJust weeks before he took office, Scott spoke against a DREAM Act bill in Congress.\n\"I'm against the Dream Act,\" he said in December 2010. \"Why? I don't believe in amnesty.\"\nIn 2013, Scott vetoed a bill to let Dreamers get driver\u2019s licenses. Scott criticized the Obama administration\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals as a policy \"absent congressional direction.\" (DACA allowed these illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status \u2014 Trump later rescinded it.)\nScott also argued that the Florida driver\u2019s license bill was unnecessary because those with a federal employment authorization card could already obtain a temporary driver license.\nBut in 2014 as he was seeking re-election, Scott signed a bill to give Dreamers in-state tuition.\n\"Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition,\" he said.\nThat was a Full Flop from 2011 when he said \"with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it.\"\nIn September 2017, when Trump was deciding whether to dismantle DACA, Scott issued a statement saying, \"I do not favor punishing children for the actions of their parents.\"\n\"These kids must be allowed to pursue the American Dream, and Congress must act on this immediately,\" he said.\nHe elaborated on his point in a January 2018 USA Today calling for Congress to \"secure the immigration status of Dreamers,\" a reference to Trump saying he would extend protections to Dreamers. Scott called on Congress to \"do the right thing for these kids by removing the uncertainty hanging over their future goals and dreams.\"\nWhile an extension of deferred action is not the same as citizenship, it is clear that Scott moderated his view and became more open to Dreamers having a way to legally stay in the United States."}

In Connecticut, the measure failed, but in Louisiana, Massachusetts and New Jersey, bills are still pending.\nIt\u2019s also true that Vermont has allowed incarcerated people to vote since its founding. Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos confirmed that incarcerated Vermonters have \"never had their right to vote taken away during incarceration.\"\nIn the 1790s, the Vermont Legislature tried to outlaw inmate voting, but it was overruled in a 1799 decision by the Council of Censors, a \"now-defunct fourth branch of government that met every seven years to decide constitutional questions,\" according to a 2008 Associated Press story. Vermont\u2019s 1793 Constitution was interpreted to mean that the loss of voting rights could only occur in response to voter fraud. That case was cited as precedent as recently as the 1980s, in the most recent attempt to outlaw inmate voting in Vermont.\nVermont\u2019s current Constitution states that every person who is 18 years old and a citizen of the United States, \"having resided in this State for the period established by the General Assembly and who is of a quiet and peaceable behavior \u2026 shall be entitled to all the privileges of a voter of this state.\"\nSean Morales-Doyle, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan public policy institute, said there are certain phrases about voting that are common in state Constitutions, but that being of \"quiet and peaceable behavior\" is not one of them, making it difficult to know exactly what it means. But he said specific laws around inmate voting, as opposed to the language in state constitutions, often decided whether prisoners can cast ballots.\nMorales-Doyle said the timing of when disenfranchisement for prisoners was codified in states\u2019 laws is far from random. Before the passage of the 15th Amendment guaranteeing men the right to vote regardless of race, Morales-Doyle said very few states bothered to disenfranchise prisoners. But after the amendment passed, he said there was a wave of states that passed laws or amendments to take away prisoners\u2019 right to vote.\nHe said the fact that 48 states still don\u2019t allow incarcerated people to vote is unquestionably a relic of Jim Crow-era laws. But, Morales-Doyle said, after Florida\u2019s 2018 vote to enfranchise felons who have completed their sentences, there has been an increased interest in efforts to return voting rights to people across the criminal justice system.\nIn Vermont, though, even having total enfranchisement for prisoners still leaves a narrower field of voters than there once was. Peter Teachout, a professor at Vermont Law School, said from 1777 to 1824, the state was \"so hungry for voters\" that even non-U.S. citizens had the right to vote in Vermont. (Vermont\u2019s capital city voted last year to allow non-citizens to vote once again, a charter change now being debated in the state Legislature.)\nThe question that cannot be answered is whether Vermont\u2019s prisoners actually employed their Constitutional rights throughout history. Condos said the state doesn\u2019t track how many incarcerated Vermonters vote. Rather, they appear on the voter checklist in the same manner as all other voters. Condos said there\u2019s very little evidence to suggest inmates in Vermont institutions were historically able to exercise that right.\n\"That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the case, only that we have yet to find any evidence of it,\" Condos said. \"Voting is the bedrock of our democracy, and we have worked hard to ensure that we\u2019re breaking down barriers for eligible voters to register and cast their ballots.\""}

For the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorization.\"\nThe opreminfo.com article, published July 10, 2018, refers to that message. However, it says the pope \"urged political leaders on Monday,\" even though the pope\u2019s remarks were published nearly a year ago.\nSecondly, the Reuters article makes no reference to \"Muslim migrants.\" Rather, it mentions that the pope called for \"broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally.\"\nWe didn\u2019t find any reference to Muslim migrants in the pope\u2019s message."}

She was one of 60 women who publicly accused Cosby of rape, sexual assault or harassment over the years. He was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison and is currently incarcerated.\nBut one conspiracy theory that\u2019s persisted in recent years claims that Cosby was framed by the Illuminati, alleged to be a secret society of elites that control the world\u2019s affairs. The rumor has been making the rounds on the internet since at least 2016 and continues to be shared on social media.\nWe came across one version of the story that\u2019s been shared on Facebook over 1,800 times.\nThe account was posted on a Wordpress blog called \"Governmental Services Corporation Watch\" in June 2017 and is identical to another story that was posted (and is now deleted) by News Punch, a website that\u2019s been associated with spreading fake news stories and conspiracy theories.\nThe story says that a \"Hollywood insider\" came forward and alleged that Cosby was \"framed with rape allegations in order to prevent him from buxying TV network NBC.\"\n\"Cosby, known as \u2018America\u2019s Dad\u2019, is standing trial for aggravated sexual assault in Pittsburgh, and has responded to allegations that he drugged and sexually abused women with fierce denials.\nThe Hollywood insider says that Bill Cosby became such a threat to the establishment elite that they had to invent the vilest of accusations against him in order to destroy his career.\nThe accusers are women who have worked with the Illuminati in the past and were paid to state they are victims of rape. Only one of Cosby\u2019s accusers leveled accusations against him within the statute of limitations (12 years), and the others, according to the Hollywood insider, are opportunists who have been paid off to smear Cosby\u2019s reputation and destroy his career.\"\nThe article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe account lacks corroborating evidence and does not include any sources besides the unnamed \"Hollywood insider.\"\nThe article further diminishes in credibility by claiming that the \"Illuminati\" is behind framing Cosby. While there was a secret group called the Bavarian Illuminati that operated from 1776 to 1785 that sought to empower a small group of people to be influential world leaders, there is no evidence it exists today. Yet the group is often implicated by conspiracy theorists of being the masterminds behind government dealings, the media and major events. These theories have long been discredited and debunked.\nIt is accurate that Cosby was reportedly interested in purchasing NBC in the early 1990s from its owner at the time, General Electric. But that was more than 20 years before the accusations against Cosby started to surface publicly. We reviewed Nexis news archives for coverage of Cosby\u2019s efforts to buy the network, and found that talk of any possible deal appears to have dissipated after 1993, when the Associated Press characterized Cosby\u2019s interest as \"short-lived.\"\nThe New York Times also said that the asking price for NBC at the time was likely to be around $4 billion when Cosby\u2019s net worth was estimated at $300 million. A 1993 Vanity Fair article said, because of this, Cosby was willing to team up with others but the offer was declined twice by Brandon Tartikoff, the network\u2019s president at the time."}

Bruce Rauner. He also said they fell short of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\nLike Rauner, J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only their federal and state 1040 forms, which provide only the most basic information on income and taxes paid. And Romney did release two years\u2019 worth of full returns, including hundreds of pages of detail, when he was running for president in 2012.\nThere is no law in Illinois requiring gubernatorial candidates or governors to release any tax information whatsoever, and Biss is clearly engaging in some campaign hyperbole when he refers to a Rauner standard and a Romney standard. That said, we find the essence of his statements to be True.","full_article":"After Democratic gubernatorial candidates J.B. Pritzker and Chris Kennedy released only summaries of their income tax returns on Nov. 27, rival Daniel Biss wasted no time blasting them for what they didn\u2019t make public.\nAs Gov. Bruce Rauner has done since first becoming a candidate in 2013, Pritzker and Kennedy released their federal and state 1040 forms, which reveal only basic details of their their tax pictures. The meat of returns, especially for wealthy taxpayers like Pritzker, Kennedy and Rauner, lies in an array of schedules and attachments to those 1040s that illustrate how they made their money, managed their wealth, donated to charity and reduced their tax burdens by leveraging breaks often used by the wealthy. And neither Pritzker, Kennedy nor Rauner have been willing to share such telling information with voters.\n\"These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard. And falling dismally short of the @MittRomney standard. Even Romney released his full tax returns,\" Biss said in one of many tweets he issued on the topic that day.\nIn April, Biss, a Democratic state senator from Evanston, released five years\u2019 worth of full tax returns, including Form 1040 cover sheets and attachments detailing deductions, supplemental income and credits. They showed Biss and his wife, Karin Steinbrueck, with quite modest income, averaging just under $55,000 per year over the five years covered in the returns. Biss spent more than seven months criticizing his wealthy competitors for foot-dragging before they released their returns.\nWith nominating petitions now filed for the March 20 Democratic primary and election season in full swing, the Rauner and Romney comparisons likely will become a hammer with which Biss will repeatedly bash his far wealthier opponents. We decided to look into Biss\u2019 Twitter claim both to check its accuracy and to examine the history of candidate tax disclosure.\nStandard procedure\nThe \"Bruce Rauner standard\" that Biss, currently a state senator, cites refers to the tax disclosures Rauner has made annually since he first became a candidate for governor in 2013. Though Illinois law does not require candidates or officeholders to make public any income tax information, Rauner released three years\u2019 worth of federal and state 1040 forms when he filed his nominating petitions in November 2013. They showed Rauner and his wife Diana had income of $27.2 million in 2010, $28.2 million in 2011 and $53.4 million in 2012. Their effective tax rates in those years were 16.9 percent, 21.5 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\nRauner has continued to release the 1040 forms since then. His 2013 returns, released a month before the 2014 election, showed income of $60.15 million and a 24-percent tax rate. In 2014, the Rauners reported income of $57.5 million and a 26-percent tax rate.\nRauner\u2019s income ballooned during his first two years as governor. In 2015, he reported income of $188 million followed by $91 million in 2016, with tax rates of 26 and 25, respectively.\nBut because Rauner has not released the schedules and attachments that detail how his income was derived, the 1040 forms lend little insight where his money comes from and how he manages it.\nPritzker essentially matched Rauner\u2019s skimpy disclosure when the Democrat filed his nominating petitions on Nov. 27, but Kennedy did even less. Pritzker released summaries of his last three years of taxes showing adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015 and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014).\nKennedy confined his release of 1040 information to 2016 returns only. For that year, he reported adjusted gross income $1,242,805 and an effective tax rate of 14 percent.\nThe financial picture for Kennedy and Pritzker, at least, is further obscured by their decisions to not release detail about trusts they also benefit from but which are kept separate from the information reported on their personal tax returns.\nLike Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy derived their income from interest, dividends and capital gains, not from wages.\nCandidates in Illinois are are also required to file statements of economic interest that detail entities in which they have ownership interests or derive income, and all the Democrats as well as Rauner have complied. But the information value from such reports is quite limited, with disclosures confined to the names of business interests and not the value of individual investments or income they produce. (Click here for current statements of economic interest from Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy.)\nRomney\u2019s release\nBiss also accuses his Democratic counterparts of \"falling dismally short\" of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, like Rauner a longtime private equity investor whose wealth had become an issue in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat then-President Barack Obama. Romney released complete income taxes for 2010 and 2011, including hundreds of pages of schedules and explanatory material that allowed a public view into the management of his fortune.\nThey showed Romney paid a relatively low tax rate of 14.7 percent on a total of $42.6 million in income for the two years combined, and that he held considerable assets in offshore tax havens including Luxembourg, Ireland and the Cayman Islands. In an election in which income inequality had become a major issue, this gave Obama\u2019s campaign ammunition to portray the former Massachusetts governor as out of touch with the vast majority of Americans.\nRomney was following what had become standard procedure for presidents and major presidential candidates of both parties following the scandal plagued administration of Richard Nixon, said Joseph Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, which tracks presidential tax releases. Obama also routinely released full returns annually both as a presidential contender and president.\nObama\u2019s successor, Donald Trump, is the first U.S. president since Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974, to not release any information about personal taxes.\nSecond career politicians\nA proliferation of wealthy political candidates coming off successful business careers in Illinois and elsewhere likely portends an era of increasing opaqueness when it comes to tax disclosure, Thorndike speculated.\n\"I don't know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials,\" Thorndike said. \"I suppose that they're better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s.\"\nGovernors\u2019 roles in administering state taxes should heighten public pressure to release full returns, Thorndike said.\n\"These candidates if they win election are going to be in charge of collecting taxes from everyone else and it seems reasonable to me that voters want to know how they conducted themselves and whether they've been living up to their civic duty in the way that everyone else is supposed to,\" he said.\nLawrence Noble, senior director the D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, said the current push in Washington for a sweeping federal overhaul, only underscores the shortcomings of the sort of limited tax disclosure practiced by Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy.\nAll derive the bulk of their income from investments, and are likely to reap significant financial benefit from the current GOP push in Washington to overhaul the federal tax system that most analysts have concluded is tilted toward tax breaks for the wealthy. How much any of the well-to-do Illinois candidates stand to benefit is impossible to gauge without more information than is disclosed in 1040 forms.\n\"Where they have their investments, how much they have and how various pieces of legislation will affect them is important,\" said Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. \"And one of the ways you can tell that is by their taxes and often it's the only way you can tell unless you\u2019re just going to take their word for it.\""}

And a regulation promulgated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives makes it clear that live-in partners are covered, Mocsary said.\nKlobuchar\u2019s claim of a loophole is accurate to the extent that the law does not apply to a boyfriend who is or was simply dating the victim, but not sharing a residence or children.\nBut Mocsary said there is a difference in risk when there is a gun in a domestic situation versus someone who owns a gun but doesn\u2019t live with their girlfriend.\n\"Everyone agrees that a firearm in a household with domestic violence poses a clear increased danger to the abused partner,\" he told PolitiFact. But there is no reliable evidence \"that there is a similar increased danger\" in non-cohabitation situations, he said.\nKlobuchar\u2019s claim was made in the context of federal law. But it\u2019s worth noting that 23 states have laws that prohibit at least some abusive dating partners from gaining access to firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\nThat includes 19 states that bar people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from possessing a gun. Among them are California, Texas, Illinois and New York."}

Rather, experts say that it would be a huge financial challenge and programs and staff would have to be cut.\nWe rate this claim Half True.","full_article":"Education officials in Texas are grappling with how to safely open schools this fall, as the state continues to report near-record-high coronavirus infections and fatalities.\nThe latest guidance from the state\u2019s education agency gives school districts some flexibility when it comes to opening for in-person instruction. But this decision has raised questions about school funding, which in Texas is tied to attendance.\nA post shared to the Facebook page of a Dallas-area elementary school said that school districts will lose out on state funding if they do not open their doors for in-person learning this fall.\n\"(The Texas Education Agency) is allowing online learning with attendance stipulations but will not fund school districts if they do not open their schools,\" reads the post from Wilmer Hutchins Elementary School. \"If schools do not open and are not funded there will be no more teachers or school at all.\"\nThe post was removed from the school\u2019s Facebook page after PolitiFact Texas reached out to learn more information, but the question remains: What do the state guidelines have to say about schools opening their doors and how does that relate to school funding?\nWhile schools do risk losing state funding if they do not open their doors when the state requires them to do so, it is inaccurate to suggest that all schools that do not open on the state\u2019s timeline will shut down entirely.\nExamining school funding in Texas\nStudent attendance is a key part of how Texas funds its public schools.\nWith the exception of charter schools, public school districts are funded through a combination of local property taxes and state money, according to Emily Sass, policy director at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation.\nSass said the state guarantees a certain amount of money per student to each district every year. Depending on how much the district\u2019s local property taxes cover, the state contributes additional funds to ensure each district has a certain amount of funding per child.\nThe number of students that are factored into this calculation comes from average daily attendance for that year, which each district reports to the state. Schools also receive a minor funding allotment per day for students who need extra support, including low-income students and students with disabilities.\nThis means schools with lower attendance rates receive less state funding.\nWhat the reopening guidelines say\nWhen the coronavirus hit Texas in March, public schools in the state started to close. By mid-April, Gov. Greg Abbott said students would complete the remainder of the spring semester online.\nInfections, hospitalizations and fatalities started to increase in June, putting the status of the fall school semester in question.\nThe state education agency released its first set of guidelines for the fall semester in early July, detailing requirements for districts in response to the pandemic. The TEA released its most recently updated guidelines on July 17 after pushback from some parents and school districts.\nThe original guidelines as well as the revised guidelines say that public schools must open classrooms for any family wanting a student to learn in person to keep all state funding, even in places where the bulk of learning is happening online.\nUnder the guidelines, if every family at one school opted for online learning this fall, the school would still receive state funding \u2014 even if the building is not physically open. But if even one family at a school wants a child to receive in-person instruction, that request must be accommodated in order for the school to maintain its state funding. TEA officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about how much state funding would be affected if a school does not follow these guidelines.\nThe original guidelines released by TEA said this rule does not apply during the first three weeks of school, when districts have the option to limit in-person instruction. The second guidelines, which were released well after the Facebook post was made and deleted, said schools could remain virtual for four weeks with the option of extending to eight weeks with a vote from their local school board. Even with this delay, schools are required to provide on-campus instruction for students who do not have access to broadband internet or computers at home to complete their learning virtually.\nLocal health officials can also order schools to keep their buildings closed without the risk of losing state education funding, according to The Texas Tribune.\nThe latest guidelines also say that the state will not reduce funding to a school that is following the guidelines due to lack of attendance for the first 12 weeks of the school year. Instead, schools that are following the guidelines but struggling to maintain attendance numbers will receive funding based on either a three-year average attendance or an attendance projection.\nThere are two formats that virtual learning can take that still count toward student attendance: virtual class with teachers in real time (called synchronous learning) or a pre-approved plan involving tasks completed on a student\u2019s own time (called asynchronous learning). Schools have the option to use either format or a combination for students learning virtually.\nFor students opting to learn in real-time over apps like Zoom, teachers must teach for a certain number of minutes in order for it to count as a full day of school for attendance purposes. The number of minutes depends on the students\u2019 age, and this style of learning is limited to students in third grade and above.\nFor students learning on their own time, attendance will be based on an approved learning plan and will be measured through daily progress such as check-ins with teachers or the completion of assignments. This is the only virtual option available for students in prekindergarten through second grade, who the state decided are too young to participate in a synchronous learning program.\nFor schools that offer both kinds of virtual learning, students can be considered present for the day for participating in either type of online learning or a combination.\nIt is not clear yet how many families might choose remote learning versus in-person learning for the fall, and schools may opt to ask parents to commit to one option or the other ahead of the start of classes. Schools can also require that families that select online learning stick with that option for the rest of the grading period, which is usually six to nine weeks.\nThe TEA guidelines acknowledge that some schools may need to pause in-person classes \"due to positive COVID-19 cases in schools.\" Schools without remote learning options available that are ordered to close under these circumstances will not receive funding for the closed days, unless those days are made up later.\nThe Facebook post also claims that if schools do not open they will essentially close completely. There has been nothing in TEA guidelines or other communications that has suggested that schools that lose funding will stop operating. Rather, without state funding, districts would most likely have to reduce staff and cut certain programs, according to Clay Robison of the Texas State Teachers Association.\n\"Some districts are in worse shape than other districts. There are some districts out there who will hurt worse than others but it\u2019s going to hurt everyone,\" he said. \"If they enact that penalty to cut off even part of state funding it\u2019s going to hurt districts and they are going to have to make some cuts.\""}

But on the specific numbers, Schweitzer is correct.\nHillary Clinton\u2019s financial disclosure forms from 2001 through the end of 2012 confirm Schweizer\u2019s claim. We rate it True.","full_article":"Did foreign interests curry favor with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by paying huge speaking fees to her husband?\nThat\u2019s the question raised in the forthcoming book Clinton Cash by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. On the Sunday shows, Schweizer said that while his research uncovered no proof of a quid pro quo between foreign interests and the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, the evidence does suggest a troubling trend.\nIn an April 26 interview on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace highlighted a claim from Schweizer\u2019s book.\n\"You have an interesting point that I want to put up on the screen that seems to demonstrate exactly the point you're making,\" Wallace said. \"Between 2001 and 2012, Bill Clinton made 13 speeches, 13, for which he was paid $500,000 or more. Eleven of those 13 speeches were at least eight years after he left the presidency while his wife was secretary of state.\"\nSchweizer responded, noting that Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees \"dramatically\" went up when Hillary Clinton, now a presidential candidate, took office in 2009.\n\"When you have one or two examples, it's a coincidence,\" he said. \"When you have this many, to me it's a trend.\"\nWe aren\u2019t going to dig into the truthfulness of Schweizer\u2019s overall thesis\u00a0here. But we are interested in Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department. His book says,\"Of the 13 Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state,\" according to the New York Times, which has an advance copy.\nBy the millions\nIn 2014,\u00a0before Clinton Cash was in the public eye,\u00a0the Washington Post analyzed Clinton\u2019s speaking fees and found he made at least $104 million in speaking fees between 2001 through 2012 -- more than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries (though he gave more speeches within the United States).\nTo find out more about Clinton\u2019s speaking fees, we turned to Hillary Clinton\u2019s federal financial disclosure forms, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics. Because Hillary Clinton held federal positions from the time they left the White House in 2001 through 2012, her financial information as well as Bill Clinton\u2019s is available for all those years.\nSchweizer didn\u2019t respond to our requests for comment, but income information on the financial disclosure forms supports his claim.\nHere\u2019s a list of all the speeches for which Clinton received a fee of $500,000 or higher, including the year, location, host and actual fee:\n2003 -- Japan, $500,000 Sakura Asset Management (Japanese finance corporation) (A note: This speech was canceled, but the fee went to Clinton\u2019s presidential library foundation);\n\n\n2008 -- California, $500,000, Power Within (life coach Anthony Robbins\u2019 brand);\n\n\n2010 -- Russia, $500,000,\u00a0Renaissance Capital (Russian finance corporation);\n\n\n2010 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Novo Nordisk (Danish pharmaceutical company);\n\n\n2011 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper);\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on October 8, 2022 in Facebook post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea has taken military action against Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Michael Majchrowicz \u2022 October 12, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2011 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization);\n\n\n2011 -- Netherlands, $600,000, Achmea (Dutch finance corporation);\n\n\n2011 -- China, $550,000, Huatuo CEO Forum (business conference);\n\n\n2011 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (international environmental information organization);\n\n\n2011 -- Hong Kong, $750,000, Ericsson (Swedish multinational communications technology company);\n\n\n2012 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper);\n\n\n2012 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization);\n\n\n2012 -- Italy, $500,000, Technogym (fitness equipment manufacturer).\nSo in the time Clinton left the White House in January 2001 and when his wife stepped down from secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton indeed gave 13 speeches for which he made more than $500,000. Eleven of those occurred since January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. Only two happened before then.\nSchweizer suggests that Clinton\u2019s speaking fees went up in 2009 in part because companies wanted leverage within Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department.\nFor example, New York Times reporters -- building off of Schweizer\u2019s work -- found that while the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, Uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation.\nAdditionally, \"shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.\"\nThe article\u2019s talking about speech No. 3 on the list above, the 2010 speech paid for by Renaissance Capital.\nABC News also examined Clinton\u2019s speaking records and found many instances in which he took in money from groups with pending interests at the State Department. State Department ethics officials had to sign off on these speaking engagements, but rarely did they say Clinton could not accept payment for a particular speech.\nHillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign has staunchly denied the implication that there was some sort of quid\u00a0pro quo for entities that contributed to the Clintons\u2019 wealth, arguing that Schweizer\u2019s book does not have firm evidence of any such deal making."}

The question is whether Democrats plucked the idea out of thin air.\nA few highlights from the past year say otherwise.\nFirst, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report expressing with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump.\n\"We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\" the Jan. 7, 2017 report said. \"Russia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary (Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.

As of 2007, about 85% of voter fraud cases involved mail-in-ballot fraud. About 58% of voter fraud cases since 2005 involve mail-in ballot fraud.

Roy\u00a0cited it in the congressional hearing one week later.\n\"Remember when TX State Rep.\u00a0@RafaelAnchia\u00a0admitted that vote-by-mail was \u2018the greatest source of election fraud\u2019 in Texas,\" Cain tweeted. \"Now he\u2019s in DC pretending that election fraud is a myth.\"\nIs vote by mail the \u2018greatest source\u2019 of voter fraud in Texas?\nAnch\u00eda\u2019s\u00a0office didn\u2019t respond to interview requests, so we turned to his Democratic colleague and ally, state\u00a0Rep.

If we do that, we only create further distrust in elections,\" Roy told PolitiFact. \"If a store owner who says,\u00a0\u2018We never sell alcohol to minors\u2019 never checks IDs, how much faith can we put in that statement?\"\nThe\u00a0cases the attorney general\u2019s office has\u00a0prosecuted\u00a0are the result of ongoing crackdowns on\u00a0voter fraud\u00a0over\u00a0the last 15 years \u2014 during the tenure of Gov. Greg Abbott as attorney general and current Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nIn 2005, for instance, Abbott used part of a $1.4 million federal crime fighting grant\u00a0to establish a voter fraud unit within his attorney general\u2019s office.\u00a0One year later, the task force brought charges against 11\u00a0individuals. One involved a person illegally casting a ballot, the others involved people assisting seniors in casting mail-in ballots, according to the Lone Star Project.\nIn 2020, Paxton beefed up the voter fraud unit by\u00a0dedicating more than 22,000 staff hours to voter fraud cases that year, doubling the time the office spent working on fraud cases in 2018, according to the\u00a0Houston Chronicle. The result was 16 prosecutions, all involving Harris County residents who gave false addresses on their voter registration forms.\nAccording to Ed Martin, a political strategist and former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party,\u00a0the\u00a0mounting\u00a0resources\u00a0invested in\u00a0finding\u00a0voter\u00a0fraud\u00a0over the years\u00a0versus\u00a0the few\u00a0cases\u00a0prosecuted\u00a0shows\u00a0Republicans\u2019 underlying agenda.\n\"The consistent context has been an unrelenting national vote suppression agenda that is based on bogus fraud claims that are not supported by facts on the ground in Texas,\" Martin said.\nAnd to Coleman,\u00a0the attorney general\u2019s recent efforts to find voter fraud cases is an attempt to bolster\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him.\n\"This is all about keeping Trump voters believing that the election was stolen,\" said Coleman. \"They wouldn't have to say that there 'are\u00a0more than 100\u00a0(fraudulent ballots). That's enough. People will believe it was stolen.\"\nSpeaking during an Aug.\u00a01 rally outside the Texas\u00a0Capitol,\u00a0state\u00a0Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, framed the rationale behind Republican\u2019s voting legislation, which he authored, this way:\n\"The other side, they used to say,\u00a0\u2018There\u2019s no evidence of voter fraud.\u2019\u00a0And so we showed them evidence, and then they started saying, \u2018Well,\u00a0there\u2019s no evidence of\u00a0widespread\u00a0voter fraud.\u2019 And our question to them has been, how much fraud is okay?\"\u00a0he said."}

Yet it\u2019s no truer today than it was when fact-checkers first started looking into these faulty stats.\nPolitiFact found significant inaccuracies in many of the post\u2019s assertions as recently as 2018. We rated another assertion in the new post Pants on Fire in 2009. And the bulk of the claims in the recent post have been debunked by such fact checkers as Snopes.com as long ago as 2006.\nHere is an abridged rundown of the assertions contained in the recent Facebook post, which the Los Angeles Times itself has long said are not, in fact, attributable to its work.\n\"1) 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right )\n\"2) 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.\n\"3) 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.\n\"4) Over 2\/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.\n\"5) Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally.\n\"6) Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages.\n\"7) The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.\n\"8) Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.\n\"9) 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking.\n\"10) In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish . (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.)\n\"All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times.\"\nThe post also says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose picture accompanies the post, \"wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits (including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds)!\"\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at some of the post\u2019s specific claims.\n\"95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens.\"\nAs Snopes.com first noted, this figure also appears, without additional sourcing, in 2005 congressional testimony by Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. \"In Los Angeles, 95% of all outstanding warrants for homicide (which total 1,200 to 1,500) target illegal aliens,\" she wrote in her testimony. \"Up to two-thirds of all fugitive felony warrants (17,000) are for illegal aliens.\"\nWhen we contacted Mac Donald in 2018, she said, \"This information was given to me by a member of the (Los Angeles Police Department), who was making a rough estimate. It refers to fugitive warrants; homicide suspects who were in the country illegally often return to their home countries when they are sought on a warrant.\"\nEven if this number was accurate at the time \u2014 and it was provided anonymously rather than being an official statistic \u2014 it is a \"rough estimate\" that is a decade and a half old. Those qualifications do not appear in the meme circulating today.\n\"75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens.\"\nMac Donald never cited this figure in her 2005 testimony. We were unable to find any supporting evidence for it.\n\"Over 2\/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers.\"\nMedi-Cal is the name of California\u2019s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state, including, to a certain extent, undocumented immigrants.\nIn 2018, a spokeswoman for California's Department of Health Care Services provided PolitiFact with statistics for 2012 and 2013. The percentage was 13.4% in 2012 and 12.6% in 2013. We rated this statement False.\n\"The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border.\"\nThis is, at best, an assumption, because there\u2019s no official data to back it up. Neither the FBI or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has officially estimated the percentage of gang members who are in the United States illegally.\nA 2011 FBI assessment said there were 1.4 million active street, prison, and outlaw motorcycle gang members affiliated with more than 33,000 gangs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It\u2019s unclear how many of the 1.4 million were here illegally.\nIn a 2017 six-week operation targeting all gang members, ICE arrested 1,378 individuals; 933 were U.S. citizens and 445 were foreign nationals. ICE didn\u2019t have a breakdown of the foreign nationals\u2019 immigration status.\n\"Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal.\"\nThis is another instance where the numbers just don\u2019t add up to support the claim. (In 2012, we rated it Pants on Fire.)\nUsing updated data, there were about 9.7 million people in subsidized housing in 2017, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nSo 60% of the 9.7 million would mean that about 5.8 million of those housing-subsidized residents were people here illegally, which experts have told us \"seems implausible\" and \"nonsensical.\"\nA 2015 report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low levels of immigration, estimated that in 2012, 4% of households headed by immigrants in the country illegally used housing programs. \"While households headed by illegal immigrants make some use of housing and cash programs, their use is lower than that of households headed by the native-born for these programs,\" the study said.\n\"All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times.\"\nOn Sept. 7, 2009, the Los Angeles Times published a column by Hector Tobar. He listed these assertions in order to debunk them and to decry what was then a new phenomenon of people sharing thinly sourced facts via chain emails.\n\"The authors of the chain e-mail and the phony government report fear what Los Angeles has become \u2014 a multilingual, multiethnic city with multicultural tastes,\" Tobar wrote. \"They search for information to persuade others to be afraid, but the actual numbers don\u2019t quite add up to the big monster they think is out there. So they make the numbers bigger. Or they just make them up. And they spread them around until all that fear and anger turns into a big hate.\"\n\"Nancy Pelosi wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits (including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds)!\"\nThis one comes from a different direction, but it has also been circulating since at least 2006, just before the Democrats won control of the House. As far back as 2009, we rated it Pants on Fire.\nPelosi\u2019s office told PolitiFact that \"internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated.\" She added, \"My record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors.\"\nSnopes.com and FactCheck.org also debunked this assertion."}

We found Cain\u2019s statement to be inaccurate.\nChildren have generally fared better against COVID-19 than adults. But the disease presents a far greater risk than the vaccines, which have proven safe and effective and are recommended for ages 12 and up by public health agencies and medical associations. To date, children 12 years or older are approved only to get the Pfizer vaccine.\n\"You\u2019re far more likely to get sick and hospitalized if you get a COVID infection than if you get the vaccine,\" said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, a professor at the University of Colorado and the vice chair of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nOne September CDC report said COVID-19 \"hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among unvaccinated than among fully vaccinated adolescents.\" Another study from July estimated that every million second dose of the Pfizer vaccine administered to children ages 12 to 17 would prevent 215 COVID-19 hospitalizations on average for boys, and 183 for girls.\nOn its website, the agency contradicts Cain\u2019s claim:\n\"CDC continues to recommend that everyone aged 12 years and older get vaccinated for COVID-19. The known risks of COVID-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death, far outweigh the potential risks of having a rare adverse reaction to vaccination, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis.\"\n\"The claim by Will Cain is completely false and contradicted by actual data,\" said Dr. Mark Schleiss, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota.\nPayton Nguyen, 12, receives the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine from nurse Lakera Thorne at Providence Edwards Lifesciences vaccination site in Santa Ana, Calif., on May 13, 2021.

But reports to VAERS are not vetted before they go online, so they are not reliable for back-of-the-napkin math, and they are not enough to show cause and effect, experts said.\n\"VAERS does not determine causality. It is simply a safety signal fail-safe,\" said Schleiss. \"A kid might get a COVID vaccine and then break her leg playing basketball and be hospitalized.\"\n\"This is a common misuse of VAERS data,\" added Dr. Dean Blumberg, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California, Davis.\nA disclaimer on the VAERS website says \"VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness,\" and \"may include information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverifiable.\" Anyone accessing VAERS must click a button saying they read and understand the disclaimer.\nPolitiFact reviewed VAERS and identified around 1,000 reports of a hospitalization among children ages 12 to 17 since May, when they became eligible for the Pfizer shot. That\u2019s a tiny percentage of the roughly 14.5 million children ages 12 to 17 who have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, and nearly 12 million are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.\nCherry-picked numbers\nAnother problem was Cain\u2019s data. Doctors said it was cherry picked, and it came from another vaccine after-effects database, not VAERS.\nWhen asked for evidence to support his claim about child hospitalizations caused by the COVID-19 vaccines, Cain pointed through a Fox News spokesperson not to VAERS, but to a slide from a June presentation by the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\nThe slide cited data from a newer vaccine database, v-safe, which uses surveys sent through smartphones to collect information from vaccine recipients who voluntarily sign up.\nThe slide said that through mid June, 0.1% of v-safe enrollees ages 12 to 15 received \"medical care in emergency dept\/hospital\" after their first Pfizer dose, and 0.2% after their second.\nLike VAERS, the v-safe database is subject to many limitations, and the responses it collects cannot be used to establish causality. \"It\u2019s by no means a representative sample,\" O\u2019Leary said. \"That\u2019s (Cain) cherry-picking data and misusing data to represent his position.\"\n\"V-safe does not record reason for hospitalization, and it cannot be determined whether hospitalization was related to vaccination,\" a more recent CDC review of v-safe data said.\nThat more recent report, published in August, reviewed v-safe responses through mid-July. Hospitalizations were reported by 0.02% of v-safe enrollees ages 12 to 15 after their first Pfizer shot; 0.04% of enrollees ages 12 to 15 after the second dose; 0.02% of enrollees ages 16 to 17 after the first dose; and 0.03% of enrollees ages 16 to 17 after the second dose.\nFor hospitalizations from COVID-19, Cain cited preliminary hospitalization data from the CDC\u2019s COVID-NET, which logged 4,228 hospitalizations for children ages 0 to 17 through Sept. 25.\nBut experts said that data is prone to undercounting, since COVID-NET is based on just 100 counties across 10 states. The data\u2019s flaws should be clear, Schleiss said, because it says that only 216,311 adults ages 18 and up have been hospitalized since the start of the pandemic.\n\"Heck, the rolling 7-day average number of hospitalizations, according to the CDC, is about 70,000,\" Schleiss said. \"At that pace, the COVID-NET numbers would be surpassed in three days. COVID-NET is just a tiny sampling.\"\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association provide a more accurate count of child hospitalizations from COVID-19, experts said. Those organizations listed 22,429 hospitalizations for children and a 0.9% hospitalization rate through Sept. 30, based on reporting from 24 states and New York City.\nOther considerations\nCain\u2019s claim also glossed over other realities about COVID-19, including that the disease has killed hundreds of children and hobbled many with long-term symptoms. O\u2019Leary said an estimated 1 in 3,200 children who get COVID-19 develop MISC, a rare inflammatory syndrome.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and Children\u2019s Hospital Association counted 520 deaths to children from COVID-19 through Sept. 30, based on reporting from 45 states and New York City, while the CDC says VAERS reports have \"not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\"There is no question that it is safer for children to be vaccinated against COVID, and that unvaccinated children have an overall higher risk of hospitalization,\" Blumberg said."}

The average Social Security retirement benefit is higher at $1,555 per month.\nThe bigger error is on refugee spending.

Refugees can receive additional assistance from other U.S. programs, but it is temporary.\nWith only a shred of truth, we rate this claim Mostly False.","full_article":"As refugees from Afghanistan arrive in the U.S. and other countries to start new lives, some social media users have revived an outdated comparison to suggest that the U.S. spends more in benefits for refugees than it does for Social Security recipients.\nA Sept. 26 Instagram post featured a 2019 tweet from Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of Turning Point USA, who wrote:\n\"The government pays out $2,125\/month in refugee benefits to refugees resettled in the United States. Meanwhile, Social Security recipients who have paid into the system their whole lives receive $1,400\/month on average. When will we put Americans first?\"\nThe Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis comparison relies on outdated numbers.\nAndrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Kirk, told us that Kirk relied on a 2018 PolitiFact article that evaluated similar claims about refugee benefits. But the $2,125 figure did not refer to a monthly payment to assist refugees directly. It referred to a one-time grant to resettlement agencies for each refugee, a portion of which can be used to fund housing and basic necessities during refugees\u2019 first few months in the U.S.\nThe average Social Security retirement benefit was accurate when the tweet was first posted, but the amount is higher now.\nRefugee status and benefits\nRefugee is a legal status for people who come to the United States because they are fleeing wars or persecution in their homeland. In order to stay, refugees must apply for permanent-resident status one year after they arrive. Many don\u2019t speak English and are unfamiliar with U.S. culture and norms when they arrive, so the U.S. offers some temporary assistance to help them adjust.\nRefugees who are granted resettlement through the State Department\u2019s Reception and Placement program are sponsored by a nonprofit resettlement agency and are given essential housing, food and other basic necessities.\nA one-time payment of $2,275 per refugee is currently provided to the resettlement agencies, the State Department told us.\nThe agency can use $1,225 of the payment for direct assistance on critical needs, such as housing, food, clothing and furnishings during the refugee\u2019s first 30 to 90 days in the U.S.\nThe rest of the money helps resettlement agencies provide case management services and cultural orientation, and connect eligible refugees with employment services and English language classes.\nRefugees receive the $1,225 directly only in rare cases in which they have family or friends who can provide housing and other basic needs. This is the total amount available, and it is not a monthly payment, the State Department said.\nAfter those first few months, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement works with states and other non-governmental organizations to provide other financial aid in the form of Refugee Cash Assistance and Refugee Medical Assistance, as well as other social services.\nBut this is also time-limited: Cash and medical assistance are available for eligible refugees for up to eight months from their arrival date.\nHHS didn\u2019t tell us how much refugees receive per month under U.S. programs. A department spokesperson told PolitiFact in a previous story that the amount and type of federal aid provided to refugees during their eligibility period can vary greatly. Cash and medical assistance, for example, are handled at the state level, and the cost-sharing amounts differ from state to state.\nSocial Security benefits\nSocial Security beneficiaries include both retirees and people living with disabilities. Children can also collect Social Security benefits on a parent's earnings record, according to AARP.\nKirk\u2019s tweet used $1,400 to refer to retirement benefits, which is lower than what recipients get now.\nThe average retirement benefit is $1,555 per month, said Darren Lutz, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration.\nThe average disability benefit in 2021 is $1,280 per month. Some people receive both benefits.\nThe Social Security Administration said benefits will rise 1.3% in 2021 for all beneficiaries, or approximately 70 million Americans."}

The attack ads are getting more direct, as the delegates in contention dwindle.\nThis ad presents a series of facts to suggest that Kasich, as governor of Ohio, orchestrated shady deals to benefit his friends and campaign funders.\n\"Right before John Kasich was governor, he collected $611,000 from a Fortune 500 corporation,\" the ad says. \"After Kasich became governor, that same company received $619 grand in state tax breaks for job creation. But last year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans, even as its CEO cut a half-million-dollar check to Kasich\u2019s super PAC. John Kasich, not for us.\"\nTo find out whether it\u2019s fact or fiction, let\u2019s take each allegation one at a time.\nKasich took money from a Fortune 500 company\nAccording to news reports, in 2001 after leaving Congress, Kasich joined the board of directors of Worthington Industries, an Ohio steel processor and Fortune 500 company. Security and Exchange Commission filings show that Worthington board members were paid $45,000 per year as a retainer, and $1,500 per meeting attended. Worthington also reimbursed board members for travel expenses and other out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Canton Repository reported that Kasich quit the Worthington board upon winning the governor\u2019s race in 2010, but was still owed deferred compensation from the board. Kasich received $611,000 total in deferred compensation from Worthington, and at least $103,000 of the total came after he had been sworn in as governor.\nThat same company received $619,000 in tax breaks after Kasich took office\nIn the first bill he signed as governor, Kasich made good on a campaign promise to attract investment to Ohio. He nixed the Ohio Department of Development and created a private, nonprofit corporation called JobsOhio, explaining that in order to lure companies to the state, government needed to \"move at the speed of business.\"\nKasich designed JobsOhio to be funded by a lease on state liquor profits. He declared it exempt from public records requirements and state audits. And he made board appointments for JobsOhio a responsibility of the governor.\nTo drum up job creation, JobsOhio reviews potential opportunities to offer incentives such as tax breaks, and sends its recommendations to the Ohio Tax Credit Authority for final determination. The tax credit authority has a five-member board, and three of its appointees, including the chair, are Kasich\u2019s.\nAn Associated Press investigation found that, less than a year after JobsOhio was created, it recommended a series of tax incentives totalling $619,000 for Worthington Industries\u2019 subsidiaries, which the state tax credit board awarded.\nLast year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans\nIn March 2015, Worthington announced it was cutting 555 jobs nationwide, which included 115 in Ohio. The company blamed the loss of these jobs --manufacturing cabs for large agricultural and mining equipment -- on industry-wide downturns.\nWorthington spokeswoman Cathy Lyttle told the Canton Repository that any incentives the company receives are only paid when the company delivers the jobs it promised. She said that pursuing tax incentives is standard business practice, and Worthington received $400,000 in tax breaks under the previous, Democratic regime of governor Ted Strickland.\nCompany\u2019s CEO donates half-million to Kasich\u2019s presidential bid\nThe Center for Responsive Politics confirms a $500,000 contribution from Worthington CEO John P. McConnell to the New Day 2016 PAC, via Internal Revenue Service records released November 30, 2015.\nSeveral of Kasich's board appointees\u00a0stepped up with campaign donations as well. OpenSecrets.org shows that the wife of ethics committee chairman Merom Brachman, Judith, gave the maximum donation to Kasich\u2019s campaign, $2,700, in August 2015. John C. Boland, the chair of JobsOhio, donated the $2,700 max to Kasich in July 2015. JobsOhio board member Gary R. Heminger and his wife, Jane, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in October 2015. JobsOhio board member Lawrence J. Kidd and his wife, Cindy, each donated $2,700 to Kasich on the same day in August 2015.\nAll together now\nCruz\u2019s attack ad parrots a complaint filed with the Ohio Ethics Commission by Kasich\u2019s Democratic challenger in the 2014 election, Ed FitzGerald.\nThe ethics commission passed on investigating FitzGerald\u2019s complaint. Chairman Brachman, who, like the other commissioners, was appointed by the governor, said that Kasich had provided enough information to conclusively rule out any conflict of interest. He added that actions by JobsOhio are not subject to the authority of the ethics commission.\nRob Nichols, Kasich\u2019s spokesman, dismissed this Cruz ad as a \"one-hit wonder\" that only ran briefly in Wisconsin and is no longer airing.\nThe ad\u2019s \"four accurate, provable data points,\" aren\u2019t in dispute, Nichols said. But he has a beef with the insinuation that any of the described actions were wrong, or even out of the ordinary.\n\"They didn\u2019t say, \u2018The governor\u2019s corrupt,\u2019 because that you could fact-check,\" Nichols said. \"Everything there is 100 percent, entirely above-board, but when you say it with a snarly voice over scary music, people think it\u2019s inappropriate.\""}

We rate it Half True.\nCorrectionSept. 13, 2018: PREPA, the Puerto Rico government utilities program, has debts totaling $9 billion. An earlier version of this story included a different number.","full_article":"As Hurricane Florence approached, President Donald Trump relied on his track record to assure the public his administration is ready.\n\"I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success,\" Trump told reporters on Sept. 11.\nPuerto Rico recovered full power in August, 11 months after Hurricane Maria. Trump attributed the struggle to the territory\u2019s floundering power system.\n\"Puerto Rico got hit not with one hurricane but with two (hurricanes),\" Trump said. \"And the problem with Puerto Rico is their electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely \u2014 you know, it was largely closed.\"\n\"And when the storm hit, they had no electricity \u2014 essentially before the storm,\" Trump said. \"And when the storm hit, that took it out entirely.\"\nWas the power system dead on arrival? Trump is exaggerating.\u00a0The White House pointed to the power grid\u2019s state of disrepair.\nFirst, there\u2019s a difference between the electric grid and generating plants. Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it.\nJorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified\u00a0two reasons.\nOne is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico\u2019s recently created Energy Commission.\nOne of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt.\nTrump was right in saying it was in very bad shape. But it wasn\u2019t dead or closed.\nBefore the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico\u2019s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma.\nBut coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout. The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months.\n\"PREPA was in bankruptcy,\" Carmacho said. \"That\u2019s true. But were they pushing electrons to people so they could turn on the lights? Yes. Was it reliable? No. it hasn\u2019t been reliable in 20 years. We might have an outage every three days. That has been the norm.\"\nThe bulk of Puerto Rico\u2019s generating plants are located in the southern part of the island, while consumption is mostly in the north. The complex system that transfers energy from one side to the other forms its Achilles heel during climate disasters like this one, according to Marla Perez Lugo, a sociologist at the University of Puerto Rico focusing on energy policy.\nUnlike in the United States, where an outage in Ohio can be fixed by connecting to the grid in Illinois, an island electric system relies on reserves, on which Puerto Rico falls short, according to Carmacho."}

There\u2019s no evidence this was a long-held position.\nBoxer\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/6e3732c3-0674-40c9-b479-b615b7a35c81","full_article":"Women\u2019s issues were a major theme of the Democratic National Convention\u2019s second day \u2014 the same day the party officially nominated Hillary Clinton, making her the first female presidential nominee from a major party.\nConvention speakers contrasted Clinton with her opponent, Donald Trump, whose comments about women have been widely noted.\n\"Her opponent said a woman should be \u2018punished\u2019 for exercising her right to choose and then picked a running mate who believes Roe vs. Wade belongs, to quote him, \u2018in the ash heap of history,' \" said California Sen. Barbara Boxer, speaking of Trump and his vice presidential pick Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.\nTrump\u2019s position on abortion is hard to pin down. Throughout this election cycle, he has said he is against abortion, with exceptions. But in prior years, he has called himself \"very pro-choice.\" So it\u2019s easy for Trump\u2019s opponents on either side of the issue to criticize his position.\nAlong the same lines, Boxer\u2019s claim that Trump said women should be \"punished\" for having an abortion is a selective reading of Trump\u2019s comments, which have shifted. He did say that women should be punished for having an abortion, but he walked back his comments the very same day.\n\"He said it, she heard it,\" said Boxer Press Secretary Peter True.\nWhat Trump said\nTrump made the comments at issue during a March 30, 2016, conversation with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews. Here are two relevant portions of the conversation. (Read more here.)\nMATTHEWS: \"No, should the woman be punished for having an abortion?\"\nTRUMP: \"Look...\"\nMATTHEWS: \"This is not something you can dodge.\"\nTRUMP: \"It\u2019s a \u2014 no, no...\"\nMATTHEWS: \"If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under law. Should abortion be punished?\"\nTRUMP: \"Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say, \u2018yes, they should be punished.\u2019 \"\nMATTHEWS: \"How about you?\"\nTRUMP: \"I would say that it\u2019s a very serious problem. And it\u2019s a problem that we have to decide on. It\u2019s very hard.\"\n\u2026\nMATTHEWS: \"Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no as a principle?\"\nTRUMP: \"The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment.\"\nMATTHEWS: \"For the woman.\"\nTRUMP: \"Yeah, there has to be some form.\"\nMATTHEWS: \"Ten cents? Ten years? What?\"\nTRUMP: \"I don\u2019t know. That I don\u2019t know. That I don\u2019t know.\"\nThe gist is that Trump said he believed there should be \"some form of punishment\" for the woman. But he quickly walked back those comments.\nWhat Trump said later\nAfter an outcry about his remarks that same day, Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement saying he meant that the person who performed the abortion would face consequences if Congress passed a law banning the procedure.\nThe statement read:\n\"If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb.\"\nIn a March 31 Fox News interview, Trump said it\u2019s possible he \"misspoke\" in his conversation with Matthews, adding that it had been a \"convoluted discussion.\"\n\"If, in fact, abortion was outlawed, the person performing the abortion, the doctor or whoever it may be that is really doing the act is responsible for the act, not the woman is responsible,\" Trump said. \"So, that's the way I have always felt.\"\nAs our friends at Snopes have noted, it\u2019s not like Trump is or was a forceful advocate for punishing women for abortion who then flipped his position suddenly. Trump was responding to a hypothetical question that Matthews posed \u2014 a question he first tried to dodge \u2014 about laws banning abortion that don\u2019t currently exist. He retracted the comment soon after."}

Why don\u2019t \u2018essential\u2019 people forced to still work get $24, too?\"\nThis is an oversimplification. Other than a one-time stimulus payment of $1,200 that will go to most employed and unemployed adults, the latest  federal stimulus law responding to the coronavirus outbreak does not contain any additional provision to boost the pay of workers still employed, including those in essential jobs earning less than $24 per hour.\nIn addition, the law gives a $600-per-week boost in unemployment payments, meaning that some recipients will receive payments equivalent to a $24 hourly rate.\nHowever, the law does not specify that weekly unemployment payments be the equivalent of $24 per hour. Unemployed Americans who live in states with less generous unemployment benefits will receive less.\nThe statement is partially accurate but needs additional context, so our rating is Half True.","full_article":"A $600-per-week boost in unemployment benefits, part of the federal government\u2019s $2 trillion stimulus response to the coronavirus outbreak, has sparked some backlash.\nAs the bill neared final approval, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C.,\u00a0 was widely quoted as saying the bonus would incentivize people not to work and, in effect, force employers to compete with a $24 minimum wage.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for this claim to appear on Facebook:\n\"Unemployment now pays $24\/hour even if your wages were lower. Why don\u2019t \u2018essential\u2019 people forced to still work get $24 too?\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe stimulus does not specify unemployment payments at a rate equivalent to $24 per hour \u2014 though, as a result of the $600 temporary boost, some unemployed people will receive weekly unemployment payments at that rate.\nFurthermore, the stimulus does not boost pay for people still on the job, including essential workers who earn less than $24 per hour.\nWho\u2019s eligible for the $600\nPresident Donald Trump signed the stimulus bill \u2014 known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act \u2014 into law on March 27, 2020.\nThe law includes what is known as the federal pandemic unemployment compensation provision. The temporary provision adds a bonus of $600 per week, for up to four months, to what you would already receive in state-based unemployment payments.\nSelf-employed people, independent contractors and gig economy workers, who were not previously eligible for standard unemployment benefits, are now eligible through Dec. 31, 2020.\nThe same law offers the same $600 per week of federal add-on assistance for out-of-work self-employed, contractor, gig and part-time workers as it does for full-time workers. The bonuses began April 5, 2020 and are available through July 31, 2020.\n$24 per hour only for some\nHere\u2019s how Graham came up with $24 per hour, or at least close to it, according to his Senate staff:\nIn South Carolina, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit is $326. If you add the $600 federal bonus, that\u2019s $926 per week. For a 40-hour work week, that comes to $23.15 per hour. (In some interviews about the $600 bonus, Graham said that would amount to $23 per hour.)\nSo that\u2019s pretty close to $24 per hour. But again, it\u2019s only for the unemployed in South Carolina receiving the maximum weekly unemployment payment.\nRegular unemployment benefits vary by state. South Carolina\u2019s maximum is on the lower end, according to the latest Congressional Research Service report, from July 2019. The highest maximum, $1,192 per week, is in Massachusetts, which is among 11 states that add benefits for unemployed people with dependents.\nNationally, regular unemployment covers half your wages, up to a cap of about $450 in regular earnings per week, Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, told PolitiFact. So, a person who normally earns $450 would receive $225 in regular unemployment benefits, plus the $600 bonus, or $825 per week\u00a0 \u2014 more than their regular pay. That\u2019s about $21 per hour.\nViewed another way, as of January 2020, the average weekly unemployment benefit was $385 per week, Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact. Add $600 to that and that comes to more than $24 per hour.\nBut that\u2019s based on an average, not a national standard.\nBurtless noted that unemployment payments vary not only by state, but also within a state from one recipient to another, because the benefit depends on each worker\u2019s earnings record.\nWhy $600?\nAsked by Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity why the higher unemployment payments aren\u2019t capped at what a recipient made on the job, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said state unemployment offices have 35-year-old computer systems, and a more complicated unemployment aid formula would have taken months to set up.\n\"The simplest way was, and the fairest way was, $600 per person,\" Mnuchin said. \"In certain states, that might be a little bit too much money; in other states, it\u2019s less money. It\u2019s not a perfect system, but the president\u2019s objective was to make sure you get money in people\u2019s hands.\"\nNo boost for the employed\nThe main complaint of the Facebook claim, though, seemed to be that people who are still employed but earning less than $24 per hour aren\u2019t getting bonuses to boost them to that level.\nMost adults will receive a one-time stimulus payment of $1,200, which is expected to occur in April 2020. But that goes to the unemployed as well as the employed.\nIn short, there is no additional pay from this stimulus package for people who remain employed. That includes people in essential jobs such as grocery store clerks, delivery workers, food and medical supply-chain workers, and lower-paid hospital staff.\nAn earlier federal stimulus law \u2014 the Families First Coronavirus Response Act \u2014 gave all American businesses with fewer than 500 employees funds to provide employees with paid leave, either for the employee\u2019s own health needs or to care for family members. That will help many workers who previously didn\u2019t get paid sick leave from their employer."}

Pence was referring to a provision that would require automatic voter registration for people using services at government agencies. But that section says government agencies would pass along a person\u2019s information for voter registration only if they are citizens. People would still be attesting that they are eligible to vote, with penalties for lying, and it would still be up to election officials to verify eligibility.\nThe goal of the bill is to register eligible citizens. Pence\u2019s warning that \"millions\" of ineligible noncitizens would be quickly added to the rolls is unsupported. We rate this statement False.\nPolitiFact senior correspondent Louis Jacobson contributed to this report.\nRELATED:Mike Pence is wrong that HR 1 forces states to shift to universal mail balloting\nRELATED:Trump misleads about HR 1 and voter registration for welfare recipients\nRELATED:Do states verify citizenship of voters in federal elections?\nRELATED:No, House Democrats did not vote to allow noncitizens to vote as part of HR 1","full_article":"Former Vice President Mike Pence attacked the Democrats\u2019 bill to expand voting rights in a recent op-ed, saying H.R. 1 would open the door to more votes cast by people who live in the U.S. without permission.\nPence wrote that he shared concerns about the \"integrity of the 2020 election\" \u2014 although dozens of courts have upheld the results for President Joe Biden, without finding evidence of voter fraud. He lamented that Democrats in Congress were seeking to brazenly \"nationalize\" elections with H.R. 1, which passed the House March 3.\n\"The bill would force states to adopt universal mail-in ballots, early voting, same-day voter registration, online voter registration, and automatic voter registration for any individual listed in state and federal government databases, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles and welfare offices, ensuring duplicate registrations and that millions of illegal immigrants are quickly registered to vote,\" he wrote in The Daily Signal, a publication of the conservative Heritage Foundation where Pence is a fellow.\nIn this fact-check, we wanted to review Pence\u2019s statement that H.R. 1 would result in registering millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally or other ineligible noncitizens. (We rated his claim about \"universal mail-in ballots\" False.)\nOur reporting found that Pence used flawed logic to make his claim, and he ignored steps offered in H.R. 1 to ensure legal registrations by eligible citizens.\nVoters would continue to attest to their eligibility, including citizenship, when they register to vote. The penalties for a noncitizen who votes or registers to vote can include deportation, incarceration or fines.\n\"This is the law in the United States and in every state, and H.R. 1 does nothing to alter that,\" said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research executive director and founder. \"These laws have been very successful in minimizing noncitizens on the lists, and ensuring that only eligible citizens are registered and voting.\"\nH.R. 1 doesn\u2019t change the legal requirement that only citizens register\nH.R. 1 does not change federal law, which states that only eligible citizens can vote in federal elections. The goal of the legislation is to make it easier for eligible citizens to register.\nWhile some noncitizens have ended up on voter registration lists, often in error, voting by noncitizens is statistically rare. For example, Pennsylvania officials a few years ago said they found potentially 544 ballots cast by noncitizens in elections dating back to 2000 \u2014 out of 93 million ballots cast. That worked out to about 1 out of every 172,000 ballots.\nWhen we contacted the Heritage Foundation to ask for Pence\u2019s evidence, a spokesperson pointed to provisions about automatic voter registration in the bill. They said that under H.R. 1, government agencies would forward information about people who wanted to register to election officials without knowing their citizenship status. But experts on election law dismissed Pence\u2019s warning that \"millions\" of ineligible immigrants would be immediately added to the voter rolls.\n\"Nothing in H.R. 1\u2019s provisions results in undocumented immigrants being \u2018quickly registered to vote,\u2019\" said Matthew Weil, an election expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nUnder the bill, a person interacting with a government office \u2014 such as the motor-vehicles department or public-assistance agency \u2014 would have their information forwarded to election officials for registration purposes unless they \"opt out.\" Some states already offer the opt-out process for voter registration, and others require applicants to opt in.\nThis section of H.R. 1 explicitly states that the purpose is to enable governments \"to register all eligible citizens to vote.\"\nIt goes on to say that government offices are to share voter-registration information only with eligible citizens. If the agency doesn\u2019t know a person\u2019s citizenship status, it would would direct them to a registration form where they would attest to their citizenship, as required by the National Voter Registration Act.\nIt\u2019s still up to a local election agency to determine whether the applicant is eligible to register to vote.\nMany of the government agencies that would be involved in the process already verify citizenship and would be able to filter out noncitizens, said Danielle Lang, a voting expert at the Campaign Legal Center.\n\"All of these voter registration options are already available in many states \u2014 both red and blue \u2014 and there is no evidence that they lead to significant numbers of noncitizens becoming registered to vote,\" Lang said.\nThe Heritage Foundation spokesperson pointed to another provision in H.R. 1, which states that ineligible immigrants who are registered in error can\u2019t be prosecuted or face adverse consequences related to their immigration status. But a person could still face prosecution if they lied during registration about their citizenship status, Lang said."}

She referred us to a story that ran July 14, 2014, in USA Today entitled \"Marijuana poses more risks than many realize\" by reporter Liz Szabo. She took the information from that piece, she said.\nThe story quoted Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a federal agency that supports research on drug abuse and addiction.\nThe relevant section in the story Shapiro cited reads: \u00a0\"Up to half of people who smoke marijuana daily become addicted. According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2.7 million people over age 12 meet criteria for addiction to marijuana.\"\nWe contacted the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which produced the survey cited by Shapiro and Volkow. We also reached out to Volkow\u2019s organization, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).\nThe SAMHSA survey found that 5.4 million people said they used marijuana daily or almost daily in 2012. Almost daily was defined as 300 or more days in the past year. \u00a0(Another 18.9 million said they had used marijuana at least once in the past month.)\nNIDA forwarded us a detailed table from the SAMHSA\u2019s 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. It showed that 2.69 million people over age 12 with dependence on marijuana and hashish in the past year.

Hall, a professor and director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland, in Australia.\nWe asked Hall if dependence amounted to addiction. He said he used the words interchangeably but that not everyone does, especially not in the case of opioid drugs.\nWe also contacted Dr. Stuart \u00a0Gitlow, an addiction medicine specialist in Woonsocket and president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. He agreed.\n\"Clearly, all those who have dependence also have addiction, but it's not as clear that all those with abuse also have addiction. Some probably do not,\" Gitlow said."}

It is accurate to say that negotiations failed. However, the claim suffers from a number of flaws.\nIt puts too much emphasis on Clinton\u2019s role, when the key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.\nThe Obama administration wanted to insulate American troops from legal action in Iraq. That was a political minefield in Iraq. While there is room for debate on whether American negotiators could have found a way around that problem, there is no reason to believe the administration simply walked away from a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq.\nThe claim has an element of truth, but it leaves out much key information that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/e0674d59-28b4-4206-af4a-35dc9368b0ed","full_article":"The vice presidential debate quickly dissolved into Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine interrupting and talking over each other to score points against the top of the ticket candidates. In an exchange about security in Iraq, Pence said, \"Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate, Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement.\"\n\"No, that is incorrect,\" Kaine shot back.\nThe argument centers on a period in 2011, when the Obama administration was negotiating with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to keep troops in Iraq. Called a status of forces agreement, it would have kept up to 10,000 troops on the ground beyond Dec. 31, 2011. Obama was working against a deadline signed by President George W. Bush late in 2008. Under the Bush agreement, American troops would be gone by the end of 2011.\nAs 2011 began, military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces.\nThe White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. Its number was 10,000. But the Iraqis balked as well, so that number shrank.\nThe New York Times detailed how the force grew smaller until negotiations failed altogether.\nAccording to the New York Times, Obama himself ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, dropping the number to about 3,500 troops.\nBut even that lower figure hit a brick wall. The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force.\nBut no immunity meant no sizable residual troop presence.\n\"When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible,\" al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. \"The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided, and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started.\"\nAustin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor, told PolitiFact in 2015 that al-Maliki allegedly supported the residual force and may have signed a new plan, but the Iraqi Parliament would not. There has been plenty of debate since then on whether it was Washington or Baghdad that was more intractable on a new agreement.\nChristopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said an Iraqi delegation to the institute agreed terms of the planned renewal could not have passed parliament.\n\"They said that the Iraqi government was too weak and unwilling to go against the wishes of those Iraqis who wanted the Americans to leave,\" Preble told us in 2015.\nOn Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by Christmas. Staying behind were a couple hundred Marines to train the Iraqi army and provide security for diplomatic personnel.\nImportant to this fact-check, the State Department has overall responsibility for leading the U.S. government\u2019s negotiation of status of forces agreements.

But other factors played a role as well, including administrative problems within Amtrak and technical challenges such as difficulty obtaining radio frequencies.\nThe statement is partially accurate but oversimplifies by leaving out important details, so we rate it Half True.","full_article":"After an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, a safety official said a technological fix could have prevented the deadly accident.\nTalking to reporters the day after the crash, which killed eight and injured many more, Robert Sumwalt, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said positive train control, or PTC, would have prevented the loss of life on Northeast Regional train 188, which entered a curve at more than 100 miles per hour, or twice the posted speed.\n\"We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred,\" Sumwalt said.\nSumwalt\u2019s claim quickly became a bone of contention between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. At a House Appropriations Committee meeting the day after the crash, the Republican majority cast votes to cut grants to Amtrak for capital spending by about 15 percent. Democrats and Republicans squabbled over both the substance and the timing of the move.\nAt a news conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, rejected criticism by Democrats that linked congressional funding cuts to the crash. \"Listen, you know they started this yesterday -- \u2018It\u2019s all about funding, It\u2019s all about funding.\u2019 Well, obviously, it\u2019s not about funding,\" Boehner said. \"The train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds were there. No money's been cut from rail safety, and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak and authorize a lot of these programs.\"\nTo that, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded, \"Speaker Boehner\u2019s comments are patently false. Experts have made clear that positive train control could have prevented the tragedy in Philadelphia. It is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation of PTC, and to deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality.\"\nA reader asked us to check whether Schumer was correct. What we found is that money is indeed one obstacle, but not the only one.\nPositive train control and its pricetag\nA positive train control system uses signals and sensors along the track to communicate train location, speed restrictions, and moving authority, according to the Congressional Research Service. If the train is going too fast, equipment onboard automatically acts to slow or stop it.\nIn 2008, a Metrolink train crash in Chatsworth, Calif., killed 25 people and injured more than 100; investigators blamed the engineer for texting while driving. In response, Congress voted to require most of the national rail system -- about 60,000 miles -- to be updated with positive train control by December 2015. Amtrak was making progress on that goal and had installed positive train control on portions of the Northeast Corridor, but it had not yet done so on the stretch of track in Philadelphia where the accident occurred. Amtrak CEO Joseph Boardman told the New York Times that the system was close to being operational throughout the Northeast Corridor by the end of this year.\nSchumer has a point that cost has been an obstacle in meeting Congress\u2019 requirements, both for private freight-rail companies and for Amtrak, which is dependent on federal funding.\nThe Federal Railroad Administration has estimated that implementation of positive train control will cost roughly $14 billion. To put that in context, capital investment by U.S. railroads in 2010 amounted to $11 billion, about two-thirds for structures and one-third for equipment. So the estimated cost of meeting the mandate is \"roughly equal to the railroads\u2019 total capital spending in a single year,\" according to the Congressional Research Service.\nWhen Congress enacted the requirement for positive train control, it did not designate funds to carry it out. Private freight rail carriers have dipped into their corporate pockets to install the new system -- and they acknowledge that they are behind schedule -- but Amtrak had little choice but to go to Congress to secure funding.\n\"Projects of this magnitude take many years for any public agency to work into their capital budgets,\" said Karl Witbeck, a principal in the transportation practice of the consulting firm Stantec. There\u2019s \"no doubt the lack of capital funding has paid a large role in the delay of finishing the implementation of PTC for Amtrak.\"\nThe rest of the picture\nHowever, Schumer\u2019s statement glossed over other factors that have hampered the implementation of positive train control. Here are a few of those suggested to us by experts.\n\u2022 Amtrak\u2019s failure to seek, prioritize and use the money it did have. A report by the Amtrak inspector general released on Dec. 20, 2012, cited several obstacles in implementing Congress\u2019 positive train control mandate. One was Amtrak\u2019s failure to come up with \"complete and reliable cost estimates and budgeting\" for the system. The report called the budgeting process \"fragmented,\" noting that two different Amtrak departments are responsible for estimating the costs of positive train control, depending on whether the installation is on property owned by Amtrak or another entity.\nThe report also says Amtrak never asked for enough funds to finish the project in either its five-year financial plan or its fiscal year 2013 budget request to Congress. A Transportation Department official was quoted in the report stating that the department purposely omitted installation costs from these documents because they\u00a0\"would weaken Amtrak\u2019s negotiating position with the host railroads because it would alert the railroads to the amount of money that was potentially available to pay these costs.\" (Amtrak did not provide answers to questions submitted to PolitiFact by publication time.)\n\u2022 The system is technologically challenging. Even if funding posed no obstacle, overlaying a positive train control system over decades-old rail lines is a complex task. Positive train control \"is not off-the-shelf technology and has had to be developed from scratch,\" said Ed Greenberg, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, whose members include most major rail carriers, including Amtrak.\nIn order to work properly, positive train control needs a certain amount of radio frequency available for the various pieces of the system to communicate with one another. The inspector general\u2019s report cited this as the \"most serious challenge\" to implementing positive train control.\nThe Federal Communications Commission -- which oversees the frequency spectrum -- told the New York Times that regulatory delays in approving antenna installation are now \"largely gone.\" Still, the accumulation of past delays, whether attributable to the FCC or to Amtrak, have pushed back the implementation of positive train control, experts say.\nPart of the problem for Amtrak has been a need to purchase the rights to radio frequencies on the open market, from existing companies that use that spectrum.\n\"When spectrum is in short supply, as is the case in many urban areas, the railroads have to go to the secondary market and purchase it at a premium,\" said Joseph C. Szabo, a former administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.\nMatt House, a spokesman for Schumer, emphasized that the senator was not implying that the delay was solely the result of insufficient funds, but rather that it was a contributing, and perhaps even primary, driver of that delay. In addition, he said, the challenges of purchasing spectrum rights are intricately linked to Amtrak\u2019s budgetary shortcomings. \"Had there been sufficient funding, the installation and broadband acquisition processes would have begun earlier and could have moved faster, and thus ended earlier,\" House said."}

Illinois House Speaker and Democratic Party Chairman Michael Madigan is one of those Democrats. Madigan has compared Rauner to Trump several times and said he feels fully justified grouping the two together.\nIn an interview with WSIU and WBBM radio stations published Aug. 1, Madigan said:\n\"Bruce Rauner is of record that he will fully support the Trump candidacy. It's documented. It\u2019s available.\"\nWe wondered if Madigan was right. Does Rauner fully support Trump? What\u2019s Rauner\u2019s take on the Republican presidential nominee? We looked into Madigan\u2019s claim to find out.\nSupporting the presidential nominee\nWhen we asked where Madigan found the information backing his claim, Madigan spokesman Steve Brown simply said, \"It\u2019s everywhere online. Google it, and it will come up in 9 seconds.\"\nBrown didn\u2019t point to any specific articles, so we took his recommendation and Googled our question. For the record, it only took Google .45 seconds to find articles relating to Rauner and Trump.\nIn March, Rauner told reporters he would support the Republican presidential nominee, even if it turned out to be Trump. When asked why, Rauner explained, \"I\u2019m the leader of the Republican party in Illinois.\" He added, \"I will do everything I can to support that nominee.\"\nThat same month, he told students in Wilmette he was \"horrified\" by the presidential campaign rhetoric. \"Democracy is hard, you know, and this presidential election, oh my goodness, I'm appalled by the rhetoric, it's appalling,\" Rauner said. \"And it's ugly and it's nasty and it's weird, and just some of the statements that get made, I'm just, I'm horrified.\"\nSince those public comments, Rauner\u2019s been asked repeatedly about his actions related to the presidential election. Rauner hasn\u2019t said much and doesn\u2019t answer questions about Trump.\nOn July 12, Rauner did not join Trump during a campaign fundraiser even though the two were both in Chicago that day. A week later, Rauner skipped the Republican National Convention in Cleveland when Trump formally became the party\u2019s presidential nominee.\nRauner\u2019s aides told the Chicago Tribune the governor wouldn\u2019t formally endorse Trump, and did not explain why not. The Tribune reported, \"Rauner repeatedly had sought to stay out of the presidential race, though he did say that as leader of the GOP in Illinois, he would back the eventual nominee. But Rauner aides stressed there are various levels of \"support,\" and that the governor would not be giving Trump a formal endorsement.\"\nBrian Gaines, a political science professor at the University of Illinois, said because\u00a0Rauner isn\u2019t up for election this year, there\u2019s really no reason for him make any more comments about his relationship with Trump.\n\"There\u2019s no law saying that a politician needs to endorse their party\u2019s candidate,\" Gaines said.\n\"(Sen.) Mark Kirk is the more interesting example. Since he would have more interaction with the president and he\u2019s up for election, he really needs to comment. Rauner\u2019s interaction is somewhat fabricated.\"\nIn June, Kirk said publicly he would no longer support Trump. Gaines said Rauner\u2019s language regarding Trump is much more nuanced and purposefully vague.\n\"(Rauner) could say voting for Trump is a form of support and he wouldn\u2019t have to say another word,\" Gaines explained. \"And as the Trump campaign looks weaker and weaker, Rauner can point back and say \u2018I never said I would endorse Trump.\u2019\"\nRauner continues to refuse to answer questions from reporters about the presidential election, and his office did not return multiple requests for comment from PolitiFact Illinois for this story."}

Alan Grayson wants voters to think he\u2019s the only true Democrat in the race for Marco Rubio\u2019s soon-to-be-open Senate seat. After all, he reasoned, his primary opponent helped Republicans create the Benghazi committee.\n\"Two years ago last Sunday, the Benghazi committee came into being,\" the Orlando businessman and former lawyer said in a fundraising email on May 11, 2016. \"There are only three Democrats in the House today who voted for it. One of them is my primary opponent, Patrick Murphy.\"\nMurphy, a Jupiter Democrat, was a Republican before switching parties two years before being elected to Congress in 2012. His moderate views have been challenged by progressives and especially Grayson, who has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the presidential race.\nCould it be true Murphy was among a handful of Democrats who voted to investigate leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton? In a word, yes, although Murphy said it was because he wanted to clear Clinton\u2019s name.\nBack to Benghazi\nOn Sept. 11, 2012, just before President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election, Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.\nVarious conspiracy theories and cover-ups became partisan talking points as the White House was questioned about al-Qaida involvement and what officials did and did not know about the attack. Then-Secretary of State Clinton and the State Department faced scrutiny that has continued during her presidential campaign.\nBy May 2014, seven congressional probes and a State Department review board had examined the issue. A conservative watchdog group obtained State Department emails about the attack \u00a0that had been withheld from one of these House committees, sparking calls for a new investigation.\nThe Republican-led House voted to form the House Select Committee on Benghazi, comprised of seven Republicans and five Democrats, to again question the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the incident.\nThe May 8 vote largely went along party lines, 233 to 186. We say \"largely\" because seven Democrats crossed the aisle and voted to create the committee. Murphy was one of them. (He did not serve on the committee.)\nGrayson chose his words carefully when he cited \"three Democrats in the House today.\" Four of those seven Democrats who voted for the panel are no longer members of Congress. Only Murphy, Minnesota\u2019s Collin Peterson and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema are still in office.\nMurphy released a statement following the vote, saying he hoped Congress would not use the panel to grandstand on the issue. We couldn\u2019t find the press release on Murphy\u2019s House website, but the Tampa Bay Times published the statement in part:\n\"While the congressman respects the work his colleagues have done already investigating this matter, when it comes to American lives lost overseas in service to our nation, we must make sure that all questions have been answered. He sincerely hopes that this committee is not used as a way to politicize this tragedy and the deaths of four Americans.\"\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Grayson has attacked Murphy over the vote. On Oct. 2, 2015, he called the committee \"a partisan clown show\" that had been \"done with Patrick Murphy's permission.\"\nBy Oct. 21, Murphy told MSNBC that officials were abusing the process and the panel\u2019s usefulness was over.\n\"Based on what we\u2019ve heard just in the last several weeks from Leader (Kevin) McCarthy, to the whistleblower to Congressman (Richard) Hanna coming out, admitting pretty clearly that this is a political witch hunt, I think it\u2019s past time that we disband this committee,\" Murphy said.\nMSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd asked Murphy if he regretted the vote, but Murphy stayed firm: \"I stand by it, because I think it\u2019s more than proven that there is nothing to hide there.\"\nWhen we contacted Murphy\u2019s campaign, his spokesman echoed a past statement that \"Republicans turned this tragedy into a political circus\" and reiterated Murphy wanted the committee shut down.\nThere\u2019s little evidence that Clinton or other liberals are holding Murphy\u2019s vote against him. Murphy is favored by Democratic officials in the U.S. Senate race, and Clinton reportedly told donors at a 2015 fundraiser that she is \"so proud of him.\"\nRepublicans on the committee have said they expected to release a final report in the summer before the 2016 election."}

Crank the rhetoric up to 11.\nIn Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has used several ads to hammer Democratic challenger Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent, about a case involving a Madison-area middle school teacher viewing pornography at school.\nIn return, the Evers campaign released an ad slamming the state Department of Corrections under Walker. The ad stars former Corrections Secretary Ed Wall, who was appointed to the post by Walker.\n\"Under Scott Walker, the Department of Corrections has only 18 people tracking 25,000 sex offenders\" and \"there are nearly 3,000 sex offenders that are unaccounted for,\" \u00a0Wall says in the ad for Evers.\nWall is one of four former officials in Walker\u2019s administration who have publicly denounced the governor as he seeks a third term.\nIs he right?\nIn the ad, as Wall speaks, his words are echoed by snippets from a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article that appear on the screen. The footnote says the story ran Sept. 18, 2017, but there is no such story on that date.\nInstead, Evers campaign deputy communications director Britt Cudaback pointed to an Aug. 27, 2018, Journal Sentinel article and the Aug. 21, 2018, Legislative Reference Bureau report cited in the article.\nThe article does note there are more than 25,000 sex offenders on the registry, but the characterization of 3,000 as \"unaccounted for\" comes from a Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Sondy Pope, not the report itself. And that number has problems.\nSo does the notion there are only 18 people tracking all 25,000 offenders.\nLet\u2019s dig in.\nHow many offenders?\nIn response to a request from Pope, D-Cross Plains, the Legislative Reference Bureau released its Aug. 21, 2018, report, titled \"Sex Offender Registrants, August 2018.\"\nAccording to the report: As of Aug. 20, 2018, of the 25,159 offenders on the state's sex offender registry, 16,219 were considered \"compliant\" and 2,735 were considered non-compliant.\nThat\u2019s where the \"nearly 3,000 unaccounted for\" phrase comes from.\nAccording to Department of Corrections regulations, an offender is classified non-compliant if he or she, for instance, has reported an incorrect address to the department or they haven't updated their place of employment with the state.\nAmong those who were non-compliant, the report found a much smaller number, 308, had absconded. That is, according to the reference bureau analysis, they were refusing to keep in touch with DOC agents.\nThat\u2019s a vital distinction. It\u2019s that smaller group that could more correctly be described as \"unaccounted for.\"\nCorrections department spokesman Tristan Cook said \"generally, even if a sex offender is not compliant, we know exactly where they are living and working and are waiting for them to provide updated or missing information required by state statute.\"\nMany, he said, will quickly respond once they are told the information is out of date or missing.\nCook cited a more recent count, as of Oct. 22, 2018, that showed 25,205 registered sex offenders. Of those:\n-- 6,205 (approximately 25 percent) are incarcerated, generally in an adult prison.\n-- 5,856 (approximately 23 percent) are supervised by a probation or parole agent.\n-- 13,144 (approximately 52 percent) who have completed supervision requirements.\nCook said that in 2017 the department referred 709 cases of non-compliance to local district attorneys for possible prosecution. Those cases, he said, represent those who knowingly or intentionally refused to provide required information.\nSo far in 2018, the department has referred 510 such cases.\nWho is tracking the offenders?\nPerhaps the more important number in the claim is the idea that there are only 18 people tracking all 25,000 sex offenders.\nThe first thing to note is that roughly half of that number are either in prison or on probation. So, clearly there are more than 18 people involved in tracking them.\nAccording to Cook, there are more than 4,000 members of the security staff in the prisons and more than 1,100 probation and parole agents. Another 500 Department of Health Services employees work at the Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center, which houses the program for sexually violent offenders.\nAdditionally, there are 90 corrections employees who staff an around-the-clock electronic monitoring center.\nWhere does the 18 figure come from?\nThere are 18 \"sex offender registration specialists,\" whose job it is to work to keep sex offenders in compliance.\nSo, the 18 is a real number -- but the ad claims those 18 are the only ones responsible for monitoring all 25,000 sex offenders.\nThat\u2019s way off base."}

Marco Rubio took an outsize swing at a provision of Obamacare as GOP presidential candidates hammered their favorite target during the CNN debate in Houston.\n\"When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare,\" Rubio said while addressing frontrunner Donald Trump on Feb. 25, 2016. \"All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money. We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.\"\nDid Obamacare contain a bailout for insurance companies, and did Rubio and congressional Republicans get rid of it? In short, they postponed a provision of the law, but it wasn\u2019t a bailout.\nRisky business\nWhat Rubio calls a bailout is actually a part of the Affordable Care Act known as \"risk corridors.\"\nWhen the health care law started requiring insurance companies to sell policies to everyone (even sick people with pre-existing conditions), those companies were caught in a tough spot. They didn\u2019t know how much to charge in premiums to cover expenses for all those new policies.\nSo the law set up a three-year period, from 2014 to 2016, during which the government would spread the risk for insurers in the new law\u2019s marketplaces while they adjusted premiums. This program is known as risk corridors.\nIf a company is good at setting its rates and make more than a certain amount, they pay Washington some of their extra money. These are called user fees. If a company is not so good at setting rates and loses money, the government would cover some of their losses.\nThat\u2019s the bailout to which Rubio is referring. He started calling it a \"bailout\" for unsuccessful insurance companies in 2013, the same year he introduced an ill-fated bill in the Senate to repeal the program.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: Several experts told us risk corridors aren\u2019t a bailout. A bailout is usually a program that saves a company after the fact. Risk corridors are a mechanism that was put in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur.\nAnd they aren\u2019t new, either. The risk corridors program was modeled after a successful plan that was part of George W. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, albeit slightly different than the Obamacare version. No one referred to that as a bailout.\nFinding money for payments\nNow, part of the problem is that the the health care law didn\u2019t say where it would get the money for any risk corridor payments. Remember those user fees from successful insurers? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, later decided they would use that money to make any payments owed to insurers that weren\u2019t so successful.\nIn 2013, CMS said insurers who said they needed money would get it, \"regardless of the balance of payments and receipts\" in the program. Rubio took this to mean that if there wasn\u2019t enough money from user fees to cover the payments, the White House would ask Congress for money -- that is, tax revenue.\nCMS said in April 2014 it wouldn\u2019t ask Congress for an appropriation, but instead would make up the difference in later years if the marketplace didn\u2019t bring in enough user fees. Rubio went to work, urging then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential tax money appropriations for risk corridor payments.\nThat\u2019s what Congress did. When lawmakers passed a spending bill in December 2014, it included special language called a \"rider\" that said the CMS\u2019 parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not use any extra money in its budget to pay risk corridor expenses. That effectively locked CMS into its stated plan of using user fees. (The same rider was included in the 2015 spending bill.)\nSome legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language, although there have been questions about how much credit he can take. Rubio reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors.\nBy October 2015, it became apparent the risk corridors program didn\u2019t work so well in the first year. CMS announced the program took in $362 million in user fees for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can\u2019t pay.\nCMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014, then wait to see next year\u2019s results. Some insurers left the marketplaces or even collapsed altogether, leading Rubio to crow his actions have been \"a big part of ending Obamacare for good.\" (We likely won't know what the program took in for 2015 until fall 2016, and 2016\u2019s totals until 2017.)\nWhether it will really kill Obamacare is up for debate. Some legal scholars have said all the rider did was highlight a problem the law already had and prevent a workaround. Two years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said the risk corridors will likely eventually break even by 2016.\nIf the program doesn\u2019t, CMS will have to find the money somehow or ask Congress to make an appropriation to pay insurers. Otherwise, insurers could sue to get those payments. An Oregon insurance company that is no longer offering marketplace plans did just that on Feb. 24, suing the government for $5 billion over missed risk corridors payments."}

And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well.\"\nRussia\u2019s ruble fell more than 50 percent in the year following the start of sanctions in 2014, but it started to regain value in 2016. There are no GDP figures yet for Russia in 2016, but from 2014 to 2015, it fell by about 35 percent.\nIt seems a drop in oil prices are the main driver of Russia\u2019s problems. But sanctions play at least some role \u2014 though it\u2019s hard to evaluate exactly how much given the country\u2019s oil crisis.\nTata is right that Russia\u2019s economy has struggled in recent years, though his numbers are a little off. More critically, sanctions are only part of the reason for Russia's economic troubles. We rate his statement Half True.","full_article":"Since President Donald Trump took office, the Russian military has patrolled the U.S. East Coast with a spy ship, buzzed an American warship with a fighter jet in the Black Sea, and defied an arms control treaty by deploying a new cruise missile.\nThese sorts of military exercises aren\u2019t far out of the ordinary, but they have drawn more attention than usual amid heightened concern about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is testing Trump\u2019s response, just as any country would when its adversary gets a new leader, said CNN national security commentator Anthony Tata, a former Army brigadier general and novelist. Another explanation, Tata said, is Putin is trying to divert attention from Russia\u2019s struggling economy.\n\"Putin is our enemy, there\u2019s no question about that, and his country is imploding,\" Tata said on CNN Feb. 19. \"The sanctions that we put on them for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine, so they could get more natural resources down there \u2026 have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well.\"\nSpeculation abounds regarding whether Trump might roll back sanctions against Russia or soften the U.S. position on Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine, so we were curious about Tata\u2019s claim that the sanctions have damaged the Russian economy.\nTata has the general trend right \u2014 Russia\u2019s economy is struggling, no question \u2014 but his numbers are slightly off. Additionally, experts said sanctions may have impacted the Russian economy, but not nearly as much as the drop in oil prices worldwide.\nNumbers are close\nTata claims 50 percent drops for both Russia\u2019s currency and gross domestic product since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, a region of Ukraine. Former President Barack Obama's administration first launched sanctions against Russia in response in March 2014. The European Union soon followed with its own sanctions.\nSeparately, Obama imposed additional sanctions in late 2016, after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russian actors interfered in the U.S. presidential election.\nStarting with Russia\u2019s currency, the ruble has lost significant value since the 2014 sanctions were put in place. In February 2014, one ruble was worth about 2.8 cents. Then the value dropped steeply over the next couple years, reaching a low point of about 1.2 cents per ruble in January 2016. That\u2019s an approximately 57 percent drop.\nHowever, despite the fact that the sanctions remain in place, the ruble has steadily creeped up over the past year, reaching a value of 1.7 cents per ruble as of Feb. 21, 2017. That\u2019s about 40 percent less than the value before the sanctions went into effect.\nRussia\u2019s GDP has also fallen over the past couple years. Tata specifically mentioned 2014-16. Russia\u2019s GDP was \u00a0$2.053 trillion (in U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to the World Bank, dropping to $1.331 trillion in 2015 \u2014 a drop of about 35 percent.\nAdjusted for inflation, however, the drop was more like 3.7 percent because of the struggling ruble.\nRussia\u2019s 2016 GDP is not yet available, but the Russian government has reported very little change from 2015.\nEffect of the sanctions\nThe U.S. sanctions against Russia targeted specific individuals, firms and sectors close to Putin. For example, they froze U.S.-held assets that belong to some major Russian companies and banks.\nExperts had mixed opinions about the extent of the sanctions\u2019 impact on Russia\u2019s economy compared with other factors, notably falling oil prices.\nDeclining oil prices worldwide since 2012 are the primary reason for Russia\u2019s economic woes given the country\u2019s dependence on oil revenue and exports, said Susanne Wengle, a University of Notre Dame professor who studies Russia\u2019s political economy.\nThe Russian government\u2019s revenue is tied to oil prices, so a struggling oil industry significantly affects both the private and public sector, Wengle said. In its long-term budget projections, Russia assumed oil prices above $100 per barrel, but in 2016, prices sometimes dropped below $30.\nIf the sanctions weren\u2019t in place, \"the Russian economy would likely have struggled just as much,\" she said.\nBeyond oil, Russia strained its budget by intervening in Crimea and depleting its reserves during the global financial crisis in 2008-09, said Sarah Wilson Sokhey, a University of Colorado, Boulder, professor who studies Russian politics and its economy.\nAlthough Sokhey doesn\u2019t think the sanctions have had a huge impact on the economy as a whole, she said certain individuals who do international business or who import certain products, especially foods, have taken a hit. For example, Russia banned importing European cheeses as a counter-sanction, so local cheesemakers had to make their own brie instead of getting it from France.\n\"It\u2019s not a trivial thing,\" Sokhey said of the sanctions. \"The Russian government would like to get rid of them, but it\u2019s not something that is seriously hurting them or leading to widespread discontent.\"\nMitchell Orenstein, a University of Pennsylvania professor and expert on the political economy in Eastern Europe, said he believes sanctions have significantly impacted the Russian economy by massively limiting foreign investment in Russia. The sanctions exacerbate the oil crisis by limiting Russian access to technology and capital.\n\"Sanctions are certainly a big part of the economic decline in Russia, which explains why President Putin has made it such a high priority to get rid of sanctions,\" Orenstein said. \"It makes it much less attractive for companies to do business in or with Russia.\"\nThe International Monetary Fund has said international sanctions and the oil price drop were \"dual shocks\" to the Russian economy. The organization estimated that all sanctions against Russia for its activity in Ukraine, as well as Russia\u2019s own counter-sanctions, could reduce inflation-adjusted GDP by up to 1.5 percent.\nFor a more thorough rundown of economic analyses regarding the impact of sanctions on Russia, see this Feb. 17, 2017, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\nIn an email, Tata told PolitiFact that he did not mean sanctions are the only cause of Russia\u2019s economic problems. Rather, he was making a broader point that Putin is trying to shift eyes away from his country\u2019s economic issues.\n\"Of course, there are other factors, but Putin despises the West in part because of the sanctions,\" he said."}

With those missing caveats, we rate Maddow's claim Half True.","full_article":"There\u2019s no love lost between MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Fox News. The liberal show host frequently chastises the conservative Fox News, and the network\u2019s process of picking the top 10 candidates for the first Republican presidential debate gave Maddow another opportunity.\nMaddow aimed her barb at the explanation Fox News gave for deciding who would be the last candidate to make the cut-off. Fox News gave Ohio Gov. John Kasich the coveted 10th slot at the expense of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.\nMaddow accused Fox News of unilaterally sounding the death knell for the lesser-ranked candidates seven months before the first Iowa voter would show up at the nation\u2019s first caucus.\n\"If a candidate can't even make it to the debate stage, why would rational donors and volunteers continue giving money and time to what is apparently a lost cause,\" Maddow said on her Aug. 4, 2015, show.\nA bit later, Maddow said, \"Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate.\"\nIn particular, Maddow chastised Fox for not using an NBC\/Wall Street Journal poll that was the fifth-most recent poll on record. Fox News skipped that poll and used a slightly older poll from Quinnipiac. Maddow said this shift cost Rick Perry a shot at the nomination.\n\"He didn't lose it, it was stolen from him,\" \u00a0she said. \"Not because of the vagaries of some poll but because of some cable news executives moving things around to effectively stack things against him.\"\nMaddow compared what Fox News had said before and what it said after it made its picks. In this fact-check, we focus just on the question of whether Fox changed the rules of the game for the polls it would use.\nFox News became more nuanced with the polls\nIn May, when Fox News first announced the debates, it laid down several selection criteria for the candidates. Among them was this: \"Must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News leading up to August 4th at 5 PM\/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques.\"\nFox News directed us to a Bloomberg article that added just one detail from Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news for Fox. Clemente said online and partisan polls were unacceptable.\nBut on Aug. 4, when Fox News unveiled who would make it to the main stage (a forum for the runners-up takes place earlier at 5 p.m.), it gave a far more detailed explanation of its selection rules than what it laid out in May:\n\u2022 \"They are the five most recent national polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques. Recency was determined by actual interview dates (not release date).\"\n\u2022 \"They used live interviewers, random digit-dial sampling techniques and included both landlines and cellphones. (No online or automated (IVR) polls were used.)\"\n\u2022 \"Their GOP primary vote question mirrored the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics.\"\n\u2022 \"Results among registered voters were used rather than national adult results when available. Furthermore, only results among either 1) self-identified Republican primary voters or 2) Republican and Republican-leaning voters were used.\"\n\u2022 \"The rank order was determined by a simple arithmetic average of publicly available results. Averages were rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.\"\n\u2022 \"Each poll has a different margin of error, and averaging requires a distinct test of statistical significance. Given the over 2,400 interviews contained within the five polls, from a purely statistical perspective it is at least 90% likely that the tenth place Kasich is ahead the eleventh place Perry.\"\n\u2022 \"We did not include the highly-respected NBC\/WSJ poll, which is the fifth most recent poll, only because it did not meet our criterion that the poll read the names of each Republican candidate in the vote question. We would note, however, even though their ballot question included Perry but did not name Kasich, the unaided \"Kasich\" response tied the aided \"Perry\" response. In short, their results are consistent with the results of the other polls in our review, and consistent with the resulting placement in the Fox News debate.\"\nIn May, Fox News took 45 words to describe how it would use polls to pick the candidates. In August, it used more than 260. Without a doubt, Fox moved from a broad to a detailed approach. We turned to political scientists to help us assess whether that shift is the same as Maddow\u2019s claim that \"Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria.\"\nA change of uncertain significance\nThe bottom line from the analysts we reached is that the original poll criteria were destined to be insufficient to meet the goal of giving Fox News a clear ranking of the top 10. During her show, Maddow interviewed Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. We asked Sabato to assess her statement.\n\"We were never sure which polls could be included and which could not, beyond the requirements about live calls\/interviewers and the like,\" Sabato told PunditFact. \"You can call it \u2018changing the rules\u2019 if you want, but you could also say they reserved to themselves some flexibility, not knowing precisely what the polling community would serve up.\"\nDavid P. Redlawsk, a political scientist at Rutgers University, said Fox could have done more to avoid this situation.\n\"They added criteria after they saw what the polls were,\" Redlawsk said. \"To me this is different. Fox should have been more specific from the beginning.\"\nBy comparison, in May, CNN named the polls it would use for the debates it plans for September and provided a much more detailed description of how it would use those polling results.\nThat said, Fox News\u2019 decision to use polls based on when they called voters and how they posed their questions passed muster with Robert Erikson at Columbia University.\n\"If Kasich was not on the NBC\/WSJ ballot, the Fox decision makes sense,\" Erikson said. \"Release data is less important than date in the field. It was my impression that even with NBC\/WSJ included, Perry would lose out, only by an even more trivial amount.\"\nMichael Traugott, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, has taken a careful look at how news organizations use polls.\u00a0He wrote a critique of CNN\u2019s \"poll of polls\" after the 2008 election.\n\"The most important point is that the system is arbitrary, used to satisfy production values for television rather than being based on any substantive or political consideration,\" he told us. \"The network is trying to use a statistical justification to cover a news judgment decision.\"\nTraugott said that taking the average of candidate standing in polls is a bad idea on a number of grounds. Mainly, differences in how polling organizations chose their respondents and phrase their questions have a much greater impact than the statistical margin of error.\nTraugott said that in large measure, Fox set itself up for this problem.\n\"If you are vague initially, when the time comes, you have to specify the details by which you acted,\" he said.\nWe contacted both MSNBC and Fox News. MSNBC said Maddow\u2019s statement was correct based on Fox News adding the criteria that the GOP primary vote question mirror \"the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics.\" Fox News declared that this made no difference."}

An earlier version of this story had an incorrect figure.","full_article":"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos opened his recent remarks to Congress with a claim that Amazon is in an \"extraordinarily large and competitive\" market, not only in the U.S. but internationally.\nBezos cited statistics to make his point, highlighting how \"Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market, and less than 4% of U.S. retail.\"\nThe figures don\u2019t tell the whole story. They include a much larger pool of retailers than Amazon is directly competing with and minimize how large Amazon\u2019s sales are compared to the rest of worldwide retail.\nWe reached out to Amazon\u2019s press team to ask for Bezos\u2019 sources for the statistics he mentioned but they didn\u2019t respond.\nOn a global scale, figures show Amazon made up about 1.12% of international retail sales in 2019, which is just over 1%. According to a June 2019 report from eMarketer, total international retail sales were projected to be $25 trillion by the end of 2019. In Amazon\u2019s last 2019 quarterly report, they announced that they had made $280.5 billion in sales during the 2019 fiscal year.\nFor U.S. retail, Amazon does make up less than 4% of total sales, according to eMarketer. In 2019, Amazon accounted for 38.7% of U.S. e-commerce retail sales alone, and e-commerce retail sales accounted for 11.3% of the U.S. retail market by the end of 2019.\nJust looking at these statistics, Amazon looks like a tiny company competing in an extremely large market. However, comparing Amazon to the entire retail market is problematic. The U.S. Census Bureau includes over fifty industries in their data for the retail market, including car dealers, gas stations, full service restaurants, and liquor stores.\nAmazon is not directly competing with most of the industries in the U.S. retail market, but it is responsible for the largest portion \u2014 38.7% \u2014 of total e-commerce retail sales.\nIts largest competitor was Walmart, with 5.3% of sales.\nThis gap isn\u2019t new, in 2018 Amazon made up 47% of e-commerce retail sales and the second-ranked e-commerce company was eBay, with 6.1% of sales.\nAmazon is dominating the U.S. e-commerce retail market, which is also accounting for a growing share of the U.S. retail industry. The e-commerce market rose from 4.2% of the U.S. retail market in 2010 to 11.8% of the market in 2020.\nInternationally, when we look at the entire world of retail (be it online or not), Amazon had the second-highest revenue of any retail seller in 2018, behind Walmart, which made $517.7 billion, according to the Kantar Group.

To the contrary, they went out of their way to state the opposite. The street fact-checkers were right. We rate Downing\u2019s statement Pants on Fire.","full_article":"Sometimes people don\u2019t wait for the fact-checkers to ask. Sometimes they just shout their corrections in real time.\nThis happened on March 13, during remarks on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C.\nIt came when Kevin Downing, the attorney for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, addressed reporters and onlookers moments after his client had been sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to an additional 43 months in prison for illegal lobbying and hiding the proceeds.\nThe sentencing by Jackson was Manafort\u2019s second in just a few days. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis earlier handed down a 47-month sentence in a separate case tried in Virginia.\nIn his remarks outside the D.C. courthouse, Downing said, \"Judge Jackson conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.\"\nObservers on the scene were having none of it.\n\"That\u2019s not what she said!\" said someone as Downing continued speaking. \"You guys aren\u2019t lawyers, man, you\u2019re liars!\"\nReally?\nWe found that the hecklers were correct in saying that Downing misquoted and misinterpreted the judge\u2019s words. (We reached out to Downing but didn\u2019t hear back.)\nThe Jackson sentencing\nFirst, some background on why \"no collusion\" is an important point.\nOne of the biggest arguments President Donald Trump has made in defending himself against investigations by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is that there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and agents of Russia.\nTrump offered the \"no collusion\" mantra on Twitter 71 times through March 13. The Washington Post counted 226 times Trump had used the phrase in any context through March 8.\nRead more: Donald Trump says collusion is not a crime. That\u2019s not right\nIf Trump could get a federal judge \u2014 or two \u2014 to give their imprimatur to that assertion, it would be a persuasive talking point.\nBut that\u2019s not what Jackson said. (We are awaiting an official court transcript of her remarks from the bench; until then, we\u2019re relying on media accounts of what she said.)\nIn her remarks from the bench, Jackson made a point of pushing back against the \"no collusion\" argument she read in the defense\u2019s sentencing memorandum.\n\"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to the matter at hand,\" she said, adding, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is simply a non sequitur.\"\nShe also said, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing.\"\nSo, contrary to Downing\u2019s remarks, Jackson didn\u2019t give Manafort a clean bill of health on alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Instead, she said it wasn\u2019t at issue in the cases that reached her courtroom.\nTwo courts?\nSo what about Downing\u2019s assertion that another court had also given its stamp of approval to the \"no collusion\" argument? That\u2019s incorrect, too.\nHe was presumably referring to the earlier sentencing by Ellis in the Virginia case. In fact, Downing made that case in a statement to reporters on the courthouse steps after Ellis handed down Manafort\u2019s sentence.\n\"There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia,\" Downing said.\nSoon after, Trump cited Ellis and Downing as support for the \"no collusion\" thesis in a tweet. \"Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!\" Trump tweeted.\nBut that isn\u2019t what Ellis said, either.\nHere\u2019s the relevant portion of what Ellis said, according to the official court transcript: \"He is not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.\"\nTo emphasize the point, Ellis repeated it shortly thereafter. \"He's not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election.\""}

We decided to look into it.\nIn\u00a0Senate File 342, also known as the \"Back the Blue Act,\" Section 46\u00a0amends Iowa Code 2021\u00a0with a list of actions defined as a simple misdemeanor. The sixth item on the list states that someone commits a simple misdemeanor if they \"knowingly and publicly use the flag of the United States in such a manner as to show disrespect for the flag as a symbol of the United States, with the intent or reasonable expectation that such use will provoke or encourage another to commit trespass or assault.\"\nThe subsection\u00a0defines showing disrespect as defacing, defiling, mutilating, or trampling the flag, which Hauenstein\u2019s tweet implied would include the process of making and wearing the image of the flag.\nHowever, the subsection defines flag as \"a piece of woven cloth or other material designed to be flown from a pole or mast.\"\nA\u00a0previous fact check\u00a0found that the thin blue line flag does not violate the U.S. Flag Code because it does not fit the definition of a U.S. flag.\nThe image of the American flag on clothing does not meet SF 342\u2019s definition of a flag, and therefore the defacing, defiling, mutilating, or trampling of that clothing does not qualify as a simple misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of a fine ranging from $105 to $855. The court also may order a maximum of 30 days in jail, according to\u00a0Iowa Code.\nCraig Robinson, the founder and editor-in-chief of\u00a0The Iowa Republican,\u00a0responded to Hauenstein\u2019s tweet, pointing out that towels and swimsuits aren\u2019t made of actual American flags, to which Hauenstein responded he was being facetious.\n\"I was being facetious, that\u2019s just my style,\" he confirmed in a conversation with\u00a0PolitiFact Iowa.\nWhether the Iowa law withstands constitutional challenges is another question.\nGene Policinski, chief operating officer and senior fellow for the First Amendment of the Freedom Forum Institute, said acts that would be considered a simple misdemeanor under SF 342 are protected by the First Amendment. In the 1989 Supreme Court case\u00a0Texas v. Johnson, justices ruled 5-4 that flag burning constitutes symbolic speech protected under the First Amendment.\n\"I think the fundamental philosophy of these laws isn\u2019t there,\" Policinski said. \"They\u2019re certainly at odds with court decisions; they are impractical to enforce.\""}

It was used through April 2017. Then, it reopened in 2018,\u00a0and the first new wave of unaccompanied children arrived that March.\nIt is operated by Caliburn International, a private, for-profit company and a contractor of the government.\nAs of July 22, there were approximately 990 children at the shelter. As of mid July, the average length of stay was 36 days.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent us the written policy related to telephone time, which was written during the Obama administration in January 2015.\nThe policy states that children must be provided the opportunity to make a minimum of two telephone calls per week \u2014 at 10 minutes each \u2014 to family members and\/or sponsors living in the United States and abroad. The children call for free.\nThat adds up to 80 minutes of phone time per month, and not 30 as Shalala said.\nA spokesman for Shalala said while she misspoke on CBS, Shalala has correctly cited the call limits on the House floor in June and in a press release.\nChildren have told immigration advocates, however, that they don\u2019t get that much time in practice. Some said the calls are limited to between five and seven minutes. Advocates have filed a federal lawsuit against the federal government regarding conditions at Homestead.\nFederal prisoners, who spend years behind bars, get far more telephone time with relatives.\nA federal Bureau of Prisons policy states that inmates get 300 minutes per month for telephone calls, with an extra 100 minutes per month in November and December. The maximum amount of time for each phone call is 15 minutes. (The 300 minutes does not include calls to lawyers.)\nUnlike the calls made by children, prisoners either pay for their phone calls or make collect calls.\nChristopher Zoukis, a former prison inmate who is now a consultant to attorneys and prisoners, told us for long-distance calls in the United States, that would add up to about $63 each month for prisoners."}

Wells refused to give up her seat 71 years before Rosa Parks did,\" the post says. \"At age 33, she owned the first African American newspaper in Chicago, the Chicago Conservator. Why do you never hear about her?

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nSome details in the post are accurate but the closing allegation that she has been snubbed because she was a Republican is wrong. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWho was Ida B. Wells?\nWells was born in Mississippi in 1862 and grew up during the Reconstruction era following the Civil War.\nShe was 30 years old and working as a newspaper editor in Memphis when she started reporting on lynchings in the South. Her work, which relied on documents and included eye-witness interviews, challenged the notion that black men were rapists. When her work ran in The Memphis Free Speech and Headlight, a newspaper she co-owned, she faced death threats and, in 1892, the offices of her newspaper were destroyed by a mob.\nIn 1884 \u2014 71 years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in 1955 \u2014\u00a0 railroad workers forcibly removed Wells from a train traveling from Memphis to Woodstock, Tenn., after she refused to leave a car reserved for white women.\nWells moved to Chicago in the early 1890s. In 1895, she married Ferdinand L. Barnett, the editor of the Chicago Conservator, the city\u2019s first African American newspaper. Paula Giddings writes in her book, \"A Sword Among Lions,\" that Wells took majority ownership of that paper around the time of her wedding, when she was 33 going on 34.\nWhat were her politics?\nWells\u2019 father, James Wells, advocated for the rights of newly freed black people and worked with the Republican Party during Reconstruction, the Washington Post reported. Both of her parents were active in the Republican Party, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\nLiving in Chicago, Ida Wells and her husband were politically loyal to Charles S. Deneen, a leading Republican in Illinois, the introduction of Wells\u2019 autobiography, \"Crusade for Justice,\" says. As state\u2019s attorney, Deneen appointed Barnett assistant state\u2019s attorney, and he was the first black man to hold that position.\nWhen Ida Wells later ran for Illinois State Senate (and lost) in 1930, she ran as an independent.\nDaphene R. McFerren, executive director of the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis, shared with PolitiFact an 1885 letter Wells wrote to the New York Freeman that underscores this point.\n\"I am not a Democrat,\" Wells wrote, \"because the Democrats considered me a chattel and possibly might have always so considered me, because their record from the beginning has been inimical to my interests. I am not a Republican, because, after they \u2014\u00a0as a party measure and an inevitable result of the war \u2014\u00a0had \u2018given the Negro his freedom\u2019 and the ballot box following, all through their reign \u2014 while advocating the doctrine of the Federal Government\u2019s right to protecting her citizens \u2014\u00a0they suffered the crimes against the Negro, that have made the South notorious, to go unpunished and almost unnoticed and turned them over to the tender mercies of the South.\"\nShe goes on to say \"it is not in favor, nor against the interest of either party that I write this. Let a man be Democrat, Republican or Independent as his judgment dictates, if he is obeying honest and intelligent convictions.\"\nWomen were not granted the right to vote until about a decade before Wells\u2019 death in 1931, but\u00a0 McFerren said, \"what black person wasn\u2019t a Republican after the Civil War?\"\nThe Republican Party was then the party of President Abraham Lincoln, and it was unheard of for a black person to be a Democrat from 1920 to about the 1940s, she said. That shifted during the 1950s and 60s as black people starting voting for Democrats, she said, and the historical context matters.\n\"To say a black person is a Republican of her era is a compliment, it has no relationship to how we understand Republicans today,\" McFerren said. \"Labeling her as a Republican when they\u2019re trying to use her in a contemporary sense is ridiculous.\"\n\"Of course she was a Republican!\" Theodore Karamanski, a history professor at Loyola University Chicago, told us. But, he added, \"the GOP was at that time the party of Lincoln NOT the party of Trump or even Reagan. Most African Americans were Republicans in the 1940s. The Republican Party switched its policies regarding African Americans with the Democrats in the 1960s.\"\nHas she been ignored?\nLast year, the New York Times ran a belated obituary for Wells. That\u2019s because since 1851, a few years before Wells was born, the newspaper\u2019s obituary pages were dominated by news of the deaths of white men. The paper in 2018 set out to rectify the record in an ongoing project called \"Overlooked,\" which seeks to recognize the legacies of other remarkable people in its obituary pages.\n\"Wells is considered by historians to have been the most famous black woman in the United States during her lifetime,\" the New York Times obit says, \"even as she was dogged by prejudice, a disease infecting Americans from coast to coast. She pioneered reporting techniques that remain central tenets of modern journalism. And as a former slave who stood less than five feet tall, she took on structural racism more than half a century before her strategies were repurposed, often without crediting her, during the 1960s civil rights movement.\"\nShe organized economic boycotts before civil rights activists who were mostly men were credited with the tactic\u2019s success, according to the Times. As she aged, her influence waned while activists like Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois rose in prominence.\nHistorian John Hope Franklin wrote in the foreword of Wells\u2019 memoir that \"for more than 40 years, Ida B. Wells was one of the most fearless and one of the most respected women in the United States.\"\nIn June 2018, though, the Washington Post reported that her pioneering work was \"all but unrecognized in (Chicago), which has no shortage of statues and monuments to leading white men.\" But, the Post said, \"Wells is enjoying fresh attention.\" Hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised to build a monument to Wells there. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala., features a selection of quotes and a stone inscribed with her name. The Ida B. Wells Legacy Committee was formed to support the candidacies of black women. This year, a major downtown thoroughfare in Chicago was renamed after Wells.\nBack in 1991, the Chicago Tribune ran a story about Wells that called her an \"inspiration.\" But in 2018, the Guardian called her \"the unsung heroine of the civil rights movement.\"\nResponding to a Twitter account that tweeted the same image that was used in the Facebook post, Nikole Hannah-Jones, a New York Times reporter and co-founder of the Ida B. Wells Society, which seeks to increase the ranks and influence of journalists of color doing investigative work, said: \"We know who the hell she is.\"\n\"Y\u2019all need to stop this,\" Hannah-Jones tweeted in February 2018. \"If the modern Republican Party wants to adopt the platform it had during Ida B. Wells\u2019s time \u2014\u00a0like sweeping civil rights legislation, reparations \u2014 then every black American would be Republican again. Stop being dumb.\"\nLater that year, she responded to another Twitter account that said Wells didn\u2019t get the credit she deserved for refusing to give up her train seat because she was a conservative Republican.\n\"Ida B. Wells was a conservative Republican,\" Hannah-Jones said. \"I think I almost choked on this one. The Republicans at the time of Ida B. Wells were radically liberal, pushing for massive expansion of govt in the protection of black civil rights.\"\n\"She didn\u2019t \u2018get credit,\u2019\" Hannah-Jones said, \"because white, racist conservatives burned her newspaper down when she exposed the lie of why black men were lynched and then across the South white conservatives systematically implemented black codes to force black people back in to quasi-slavery.\"\nToday, McFerren said, Wells is \"celebrated everywhere,\" and she\u2019s enjoyed a renaissance in the past several years.\nKaramanski told us that if you haven\u2019t heard of Ida B. Wells, \"it is because you have been willfully ignorant of Chicago history, women\u2019s history, and African American history. It is NOT because she was Republican.\""}

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nTrump pushed a false argument of a stolen election even before Election Day in November. Trump is still wrong in claiming that \"facts have now come out to show conclusively\" that the 2020 election was illegitimate.\nNo evidence has emerged to reverse the election results in any state.\n\"Any such evidence would be earth-shattering,\" said Matthew Weil, an election expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"And the fact it hasn\u2019t materialized more than six months after the voting stopped indicates that the election was legitimate and secure.\"\nTrump cites debunked claims about swing states\nTrump\u2019s PAC did not respond to a request for comment, but his statement included as evidence allegations about fraud in swing states. Here\u2019s a sampling of those allegations, along with the facts and context:\n\"101,789 \u2018obsolete\u2019 voters on the rolls in Georgia, including 18,486 dead people.\" Trump is distorting Georgia\u2019s plan for routine cleanup of voter rolls. Under federal law, states need to update their voter rolls, and they often do so in odd-numbered years. Most of the people flagged for removal in Georgia have moved, and some have died. The state\u2019s top election official said \"there was no record\" that any of the dead individuals cast a ballot in the 2020 or January runoff elections.\n\n\n\"Nearly 200,000 illegal \u2018indefinitely confined\u2019 votes in Wisconsin\u2019 violated Voter ID law.\" This is a misrepresentation of the facts. A Wisconsin law allows voters to declare themselves as \"indefinitely confined\" and then cast an absentee ballot without providing a photo ID.\n\n\n\"\u2018Massive\u2019 chain of custody problems with drop boxes in Georgia, missing hundreds of thousands of records for months after the election.\" This debunked claim stems from a report by Georgia Star News, a pro-Trump publication, that requested chain of custody forms that show the movement of ballots in the state. Fulton County didn\u2019t provide all the forms to Georgia Star News, but later provided almost all the forms to Georgia Public Broadcasting, an NPR affiliate.\nFederal and state election officials have said the election was legitimate\nThe most recent evidence affirming that the 2020 election was legitimate came from Republicans in Michigan, a state that Trump won in 2016 and lost in 2020.\n\"The committee found no evidence of widespread or systemic fraud in Michigan's prosecution of the 2020 election,\" said a June report by the Michigan Senate Oversight Committee, chaired by a Republican. \"Citizens should be confident the results represent the true results of the ballots cast by the people of Michigan.\"\nThe 55-page report debunks multiple claims of election fraud or irregularities pushed by Trump.\nState and local government officials elsewhere also have defended the integrity of the election in their states. Nationwide, election officials, including some in Trump\u2019s administration, affirmed that the 2020 election was \"the most secure in American history.\"\nResults affirmed by courts, audits done by election officials\nNationwide, about 90 judges ruled against Trump or his allies in election cases, including 38 judges appointed by Republican presidents, according to a\u00a0 Washington Post analysis.\n\"Not one court found any fraud that could come close to altering the outcome in any state,\" David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, told PolitiFact.\nThere were more audits of paper ballots after the 2020 election than after any other election, Becker said. Georgia, for example, counted its ballots three times, three different ways, with observers from both parties, and all audits confirmed that Biden won, Becker said.\nIn Arizona, state Senate Republicans organized a review of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County. Those findings are expected this summer. But election experts have criticized the review as partisan and amateurish.\nThe Maricopa County review \"does not meet the standards of a proper election recount or audit,\" said an evaluation of the ballot review by Trey Grayson, former Republican Kentucky secretary of state, and Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist.\nThey concluded that \"because it lacks the essential elements of a bona fide post-election analysis, the review currently underway in Maricopa County will not produce findings that should be trusted.\"\nThe Maricopa County Board of Supervisors \u2014 four of whose five members are Republicans \u2014 called the review a \"circus.\" They said the county\u2019s election was \"free and fair and conducted by the elections department with integrity and honor.\""}

But on the facts, McConnell got it mostly right, with two imperfections on the margins, regarding both the timeline and the exact phrasing of Kerry\u2019s charge against the Reagan administration. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.","full_article":"The controversy over a letter to Iran\u2019s leaders signed by 47 Republican senators prompted a sudden surge of interest in past efforts by lawmakers to meet with foreign leaders.\nAfter taking hits from many Democrats and some Republicans who said the letter unwisely undercut President Barack Obama\u2019s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear capabilities, Republicans pushed back with examples of congressional Democrats engaged in overseas freelancing when Republicans held the White House.\nFor instance, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh charged that the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy \"sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact.\" We rated that claim False. Other claims have involved House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other lawmakers.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on March 15 to answer questions from host Dana Bash about what she called the \"rushed way\" the letter was circulated as senators were trying to get out of town for a snowstorm. She asked McConnell to explain the process, but McConnell began by sidestepping her question.\n\"Well, Dana, first, let me just say, I think this is a good case of selective outrage,\" McConnell said. \"I remember reading about Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) when he was the majority leader flying to Moscow during the negotiations over the SALT II treaty, explaining to the Russians the Senate's role in treaty ratification. And John Kerry, when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism. So, look, members of Congress expressing themselves about important matters, not only at home, but around the world, is not unprecedented.\"\nSince Kerry, many years later, is a central player in the Iran negotiations, we decided to focus on the claim that referenced him. (Indeed, on Sunday, Kerry said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that the letter from the 47 senators \"was absolutely calculated directly to interfere with these negotiations. \u2026 That is unprecedented.\")\nThere are some differences between the recent examples and the Kerry visit -- including the fact that the Nicaragua episode involved two individual lawmakers rather than 87 percent of the Senate GOP caucus, including the majority leader. But we\u2019ll leave it to readers to judge whether McConnell\u2019s comparison is apt.\nHere, we\u2019ll look instead at the more straightforward factual question of whether Kerry, \"when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism.\"\nWhen we dug into the archives, we found that the episode in question occurred almost exactly 30 years ago, in April 1985. It came at a time when Ortega, Nicaragua\u2019s communist strongman, was being challenged by a U.S.-aligned rebel movement known as the Contras. (Now, after a period out of office in the 1990s, Ortega is once again Nicaragua\u2019s president.)\nHere\u2019s how the Associated Press covered Kerry\u2019s comments in an April 16, 1985, dispatch:\n\"Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said Monday he and another Vietnam-era veteran, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, plan to go to Nicaragua this week in part because of worries the United States is repeating the mistakes of Vietnam in Central America.\n\"Kerry said he and Harkin plan to meet with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and with business, church and opposition leaders.\n\"Their trip comes the week before the Senate is scheduled to vote on President Reagan's request for an additional $14 million in aid to the \u2018contra\u2019 rebels seeking to overthrow Ortega's leftist government.\n\"Sen. Harkin and I are going to Nicaragua as Vietnam-era veterans who are alarmed that the Reagan administration is repeating the mistakes we made in Vietnam,\" Kerry said.\n\"Our foreign policy should represent the democratic values that have made our country great, not subvert those values by funding terrorism to overthrow governments of other countries,\" Kerry said. \u2026 Kerry said he and Harkin plan to leave Thursday for Nicaragua and return on Saturday.\"\nThis provides support for what McConnell said. We see only two inaccuracies, both around the margins.\nFirst, the way McConnell structured his claim suggests that Kerry made these statements after flying to Managua. In reality, the AP article makes it clear that he made the statement in the days before he and Harkin left for Managua.\nSecond, McConnell could have been more precise in how he relayed Kerry\u2019s use of the word \"terrorism.\" McConnell said Kerry \"accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism.\" That\u2019s a slight exaggeration of Kerry\u2019s words. Kerry actually said that the Reagan administration was \"funding terrorism to overthrow governments of other countries.\" A slight rhetorical difference, but a difference nonetheless.\nStill, McConnell\u2019s claim is pretty close to the mark.\nKerry\u2019s staff did not dispute the accuracy of the AP report. They did point PolitiFact to an April 24, 1985, Washington Post story about the votes on the Contra aid bill. The article noted that the late Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., said it was \"wrong, wrong, wrong\" for Kerry and Harkin to visit Nicaragua the previous week and return with a negotiating proposal from President Daniel Ortega.\nAccording to the Post article, \"Kerry responded by reading a letter from Secretary of State George P. Shultz endorsing the idea of congressional visits to all Central American nations, including Nicaragua.\" Kerry\u2019s comments at the time appear to accurately portray what Schultz wrote. Here\u2019s an excerpt; the full text is available here.\n\"I strongly encourage members of Congress, of both parties and regardless of their views on Central America, to visit not only Nicaragua but all of the countries of the region,\" Schultz wrote. \"I would urge them to spend as much time there as their schedules will permit, to travel outside the capitals, and to talk with citizens in and out of government and of all political persuasions in order to better understand the difficult issues we must all resolve in forgoing a bipartisan policy on Central America. The Department of State will be pleased to assist members of Congress with their travel in any way possible.\""}

Research does show that a higher percentage of girls in school correlates with a higher gross domestic product. But those findings are much more limited than many people understand.\nBehind all the research, there\u2019s uncertainty about whether a stronger economy leads to more girls in school, or if more girls in school leads to a stronger economy.\nNo single rule applies everywhere. A stronger economy, for instance, provides both the resources and incentives to educate more women, who go to school, earn more and boost the economy a little higher. But it doesn\u2019t always work that way. In the Middle East and North Africa, more women might be educated but for social and religious reasons, they can\u2019t work, or must work in jobs that don\u2019t fully reward their level of education.\nAnd the biggest sticking point is that what\u2019s been called the \"girl effect\" seems to be much stronger in middle-income countries. For poorer nations, the effect is more muted.\nA few key studies and cautions\nThe White House press office backed up the First Lady\u2019s claim by citing policy reports that declared that educating girls and young women would boost a country\u2019s economy. One from the World Bank said \"By effectively educating more women -- that is, providing more women with a high-quality education -- more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results.\"\nThose reports didn\u2019t actually give the underlying research, so we\u2019ll cover the highlights.\n\u2022 A 2009 article in the journal Feminist Economics compared regions of the world and measured gender gaps in both education and employment. That\u2019s worth noting because, while the two generally go hand-in-hand, they are separate. You can educate girls, but if companies won\u2019t hire them, a lot of the economic benefit is lost.\nThis study\u2019s bottom line was that between 1960 and 2000, East Asia\u2019s growth rate was .9 percent higher than the region of the Middle East-North Africa. The difference was due to the higher fraction of girls in school in East Asia.\n\u2022 A 2011 World Bank study took 14 countries and teased out what would happen if every girl finished whatever level of school she was in -- either primary or secondary. Not surprisingly, the economic impact depended hugely on a country\u2019s starting point. India and China, for example, had very low rates of girls not completing school, while on the opposite end, places like Burundi and Senegal had dropout rates over 80 percent.\nSo the study found that getting girls and young women to complete a given level of schooling added a \"barely noticeable\" amount in India and China, while in the other countries, researchers predicted a hefty rise.\nOne important contribution of this research is it factored in the diminishing returns of educating more women. When more people hit the job market, it tends to drive wages down. There\u2019s still a net gain, but in this study, earnings could be about 20 percent less than you might expect.\nTuck that point away and keep it in mind for the next landmark analysis on our list. It provided advocacy groups with a talking point that has gone viral.\n\u2022 In a 1999 World Bank paper Gender inequality, income and growth: Are good times good for women?, economists David Dollar and Roberta Gatti worked with data on 100 nations. The finding that gained the most traction was that \"in the countries with higher initial education, an increase of 1 percentage point in the share of adult women with secondary school education implies an increase in per capita income growth of 0.3 percentage points.\"\nThat might seem like a simple equation, but it actually makes two points that are often overlooked.\nThe economic growth took place only in middle-income countries that already had a higher rate of educating women. \"For the poorer half of the observations, there is no relationship between female attainment and income,\" the authors wrote.\nThe other generally ignored element is that the 1 percent increase in educated women applies to completing secondary education. Simply putting more girls in classrooms at any grade level wouldn\u2019t necessarily deliver the same results. You have to get the girls all the way through high school.\nSpecifics are important when measuring education gains\nHere\u2019s where many organizations, including USAID, get into trouble. They say -- right now on their website -- that \"if 10 percent more girls attend school, a country\u2019s GDP increases by an average of 3 percent.\"\nThat statement has three flaws. First, it treats all nations the same, whether they are low income or middle income. Second, it treats all education the same, whether it\u2019s primary or secondary.\nPerhaps most troubling is it scales up the original equation by a factor of 10.\nDollar, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that doing that \"is a bit risky.\"\n\"You would expect diminishing returns,\" he said.\nWhich takes us back to that 2011 World Bank study we tucked away. It predicted wages would be about 20 percent lower than you would expect. Less money in women\u2019s pockets means less economic activity, and less economic growth."}

Kelly was appointed to the seat by soon-to-be-former Gov. Scott Walker.\nAssembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, is crying foul -- and hypocrisy.\n\"One year ago, (Republicans) would not fill seats vacated for people who went to the administration because of the cost of those elections,\" said Hintz, in a Nov. 18, 2018, interview on WISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront with Mike Gousha.\" \"Now, they\u2019re talking about changing the rules to add additional elections that will cost millions of dollars of taxpayer expense.\"\nLet\u2019s take a look at both parts of Hintz\u2019s claim.\nLegislative elections\nWalker did initially decline to call special elections after two GOP lawmakers stepped down in December 2017 to join his administration.\nAt the time, Walker argued for leaving the seats open until the regularly scheduled Nov. 6, 2018, election. Democrats countered it was not fair to leave residents of those districts without representation for that long, noting the law requires elections to be held promptly.\nWalker himself cited cost as a factor, speaking to reporters in Pewaukee:\n\"It\u2019s just a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. The Legislature would be adjourned before a special election was held so (candidates would) ... have to be running for the fall election for a state legislative seat at the same time there would be a special election for a seat that wouldn\u2019t get to vote on anything until after the fall election anyway.\"\nThe seats had belonged to former state Sen. Frank Lasee of De Pere and former state Rep. Keith Ripp of Lodi. The two Republicans stepped down in December 2017 to join Walker's administration.\nVoters in those areas took Walker to court with the help of a group headed by Eric Holder, the first attorney general under Democratic President Barack Obama.\nOn March 22, 2018, Dane County Circuit Judge Josann Reynolds held Walker had a duty under state law to hold special elections. A second Dane County judge denied a delay. So did an appellate judge. Ultimately, Walker and the GOP dropped the matter instead of taking it to the state Supreme Court, and the elections were held.\nSo, Walker and Republicans did describe scheduling the elections as a waste of money, though they also cited other reasons. Chiefly, that the Legislature would be adjourned before a special election was held.\nPresidential election\nNow to the second part of Hintz\u2019s claim -- that Republicans are now \"talking about changing the rules to add additional elections that will cost millions of dollars of taxpayer expense.\"\nOn Nov. 15, 2018, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Republicans are considering using the lame-duck session -- while they still hold the governor\u2019s office -- to help keep a conservative on the state Supreme Court and give GOP lawmakers greater control of two state boards.\nRepublicans have been concerned about the 2020 state Supreme Court race because it is scheduled to be held alongside Wisconsin's presidential primary \u2014 when Democratic turnout is expected to far outpace Republican turnout, since Democrats will be deciding who will challenge President Donald Trump.\nA turnout imbalance could spell trouble for Kelly, whom Walker appointed in 2016.\nRepublican legislative leaders, the Journal Sentinel reported, are looking at moving the 2020 presidential primary from April, possibly to March of that year. The GOP plan would require voters to go to the polls three times in the spring of 2020 \u2014 likely in February, March and April.\nHolding the extra election would indeed cost millions.\nNearly 30 of Wisconsin's 72 county clerks have come out against the proposal, noting -- among other issues -- the statewide cost of holding a standard spring election is around $7 million.\nHintz\u2019s statement was a bit off, however, in that he said the GOP was considering holding multiple extra elections. Only one is being considered."}

But it is one of two scenarios the report offers, so Sanders\u2019 use of the term \"would\" is too strong. The alternative figure, which assumes that a Medicare for All plan isn\u2019t as successful in controlling costs as its sponsors hope it will be, would lead to an increase of almost $3.3 trillion in national health care expenditures, not a decline. Independent experts say the alternative scenario of weaker cost control is at least as plausible.\nWe rate the statement Half True.","full_article":"When a free-market think tank published its analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer health care plan, Republicans took to social media to tout the report\u2019s most eye-popping finding.\nSanders\u2019 Medicare for All would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years, an amount they framed as crushingly large.\nSanders, however, found good news for his idea in the generally skeptical report.\nIn a video he shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the report\u2019s findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia.\nSanders said, \"Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. \u2026 That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center.\"\nSanders\u2019 plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone\u2019s medical bills.\nSanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers.\nSkeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyone\u2019s bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays.\nIn a way, Sanders is right, though his assertion glosses over some caveats.\nWhere the $2 trillion estimate comes from\nThe Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders\u2019 bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, it\u2019s not hard to find the $2 trillion in question.\nIt\u2019s the difference between the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 projection of the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All proposal. (See Table 2.)\nUnder Mercatus\u2019 projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system.\nSpecifically, total health care expenditures would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years, according to Mercatus.\nSo there\u2019s definitely something to what Sanders said.\nSome reasons for pause\nThe Mercatus report\u2019s author took issue with Sanders\u2019 focus on that figure.\nCharles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders\u2019 plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent.\nHowever, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively (see Table 4) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law.\nSo while the number Sanders chose really does appear in the report, he\u2019s cherry-picked the more flattering of two estimates.\nSanders\u2019 bill \"indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicare\u2019s payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance,\" Blahous said. \"Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending.\"\nBut would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution.\nSustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are \"not likely feasible,\" said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it\u2019s a \"pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically.\"\nIn addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem.\nJosh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. \"Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care,\" he said."}

Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently introduced a bill that would require the Social Security Administration to do a better job of tracking the departed to make sure their federal benefits don\u2019t survive.\n\"The SSA (Social Security Administration\u2019s) Office of the Inspector General reported last month that, according to the agency\u2019s own records, there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older,\" Warner said in an April 23 news release.\nThat\u2019s more than twice the of population of Chicago -- filled with people at least 112. It\u2019s especially remarkable when you consider that the Gerontology Research Group says it knew of 42 people in the world who were alive last October at 112 or older. Fifteen of them lived in the U.S.\nThe immortal Social Security numbers, Warner said, open avenues for fraudulent benefit claims.\nWe wondered whether the senator\u2019s Social Security figures were correct.\nWarner\u2019s office pointed us to a March 4 report issued by Patrick O\u2019Carroll Jr., the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general. O\u2019Carroll testified about the agency\u2019s death records during a March 16 hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used.\nThe agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a \"Death Master File\" with nearly 90 million electronic records that\u2019s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud.\nSometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recently reported on CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency\u2019s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead.\nAnd sometimes the opposite is true, O'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when \u00a0the agency has been informed of the deaths.\nIt all came to a head a few years ago when O'Carroll\u2019s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world\u2019s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation.\nThe auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records.\nThe good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, \"thousands\" of the numbers \"could have been used\" to commit other types of identity fraud.\nAuditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports.\nThat means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S.\nFinal notes: If you\u2019re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing is Jeralean Talley of Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23. \u00a0The oldest man is Sakari Momoi of Japan, who turned 112 in February.\nThe verified oldest person ever was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years, 164 days old. The oldest man was Christian Mortensen of Denmark, who died in 1998 at 115 years, 252 days."}

(The ordinance was struck down\u00a0in Miami-Dade circuit court in March.)\nUlvert has a point that multiple news outlets \u2014 mostly columnists \u2014 have accused Scott of plugging low wages in the context of the radio ad and trips to California, even though he\u2019s never explicitly said it. Here\u2019s an example editorial from the Palm Beach Post.\n\"Gov. Rick Scott has spent the week on another job poaching expedition, this time in California.

His pitch: Wages are low in Florida.\"\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve looked at this argument. Scott has openly tried to steal jobs from other states for years.\nIn 2016, then-U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham accused Scott of going \"around the country\" and bragging about Florida\u2019s low wages to other states. Florida\u2019s wages in 2016 were low by national standards, but it didn\u2019t appear Scott boasted (at least publicly) about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states.\nWhen we reviewed Scott\u2019s statements from these recruiting missions, we found he did focus quite a bit on the state\u2019s low taxes for businesses. He never explicitly advertised it like Graham, and now Levine, said.\n\"By raising the minimum wage in California, 700,000 people are going to lose their jobs, there are a lot of opportunities for companies to prosper in Florida and compete here, and that's what I'm going after,\" Scott said on his three-day tour.\nBy the way, PolitiFact Florida previously researched whether California stood to lose 700,000 jobs because of the wage increase and rated the statement Mostly False. We learned the figure was a projection of how many jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn\u2019t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment."}

On Oct. 13, the Democratic presidential nominee said he is not a fan of the strategy. In a town hall two days later, he said he would give his position only after seeing how the confirmation process now under way for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is handled.\nSocial media posts suggest, though, that Biden will not say what he stands for on any issue until after the election.\nOne Facebook post says, \"Biden said, \u2018The day after I\u2019m elected I will let you know what I stand for, bc if I tell you now it will be all over the news\u2019 ????

The purported quote is a\u00a0distortion of comments he made about whether he would support packing the court.

Ernst is the Vice Chair of the Senate GOP Conference, meaning she is part of Republican leadership.\nHowever, she didn\u2019t vote down additional funds for hospitals or COVID-19 testing in the final half-a-trillion-dollar package. She said later she pushed for hospital funding included in the interim relief package. But, she never said she directly opposed that funding. Rather, she said it should be discussed at a later date.\nThe claim is partially accurate but needs additional context. We rate it Half True.","full_article":"The Iowa Democratic Party claims in its 2020 campaign against U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, that Ernst reversed her support for a coronavirus relief plan 3.5, which offered nearly half a trillion dollars for small businesses, hospitals and testing.\nThe Iowa Democratic Party claimed in the headline of an April 21 statement that Ernst opposed funding for hospitals and COVID-19 testing for weeks before $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing was included in an interim coronavirus relief bill passed by the Senate April 21 and signed by President Trump April 24. It\u2019s a claim Democrats have continued to make against Ernst.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats blocked interim economic relief packages proposed by the other party in April before the final half-a-trillion-dollar package cleared the Senate. The Republicans\u2019 proposal would\u2019ve solely funded the quickly depleted Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and launched April 4 for businesses that keep employees on their payroll. Democrats pushed for a $500-billion-dollar-plus aid package with Paycheck Protection Program funds as well as $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local government, of which some of the hospital funds made it into the final deal.\nIowa Democratic Party Communications Director Jeremy Busch referred in an interview with The Daily Iowan to a series of interviews and public statements Ernst made in April as proof her tune had changed on the expanded relief funding.\nAs negotiations on refilling the Paycheck Protection Program were ongoing, Ernst said in an April 16 Fox News interview she supported the program and disagreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Congress should wait.\n\"We have small businesses that desperately need this funding to keep their employees on payroll. If they can't do that, those employees will go unemployed and that is not the route. So, I do believe that what we had was a narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP, but the Democrats wanted to hijack it with unrelated items and additional changes. We have a program that's working, now we need to make sure that it's properly funded.\"\nIn an email to the Daily Iowan's PolitiFact Iowa, Ernst\u2019s spokesperson, Brendan Conley, wrote that Ernst\u2019s comment on \"unrelated items and additional changes\" referred to an early House version of what eventually became the CARES Act, the third relief bill. The version Conley referred to was noted in a March 23 article in the Hill; it didn\u2019t clear the Senate but included funding to curb airline pollution. However, the Paycheck Protection Program launched after that article, on April 3, as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, making it unlikely that the narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP referred to the measure that created the loan program.\nThe proposal that better fits what Ernst is describing in the Fox News interview would\u2019ve bumped up funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, asked senators on April 9 to approve with unanimous consent a measure that would have added $250 million in federal funds to the Paycheck Protection Program. He argued on the Senate floor that the small business loan program's funds were running out and that negotiations for hospital, local government, and test funding should be part of a separate congressional package at a later date. The reason: the extra funding wouldn\u2019t pass unanimously, he said.\nHowever, McConnell\u2019s measure did not receive unanimous consent, as two Democrats voiced opposition. No formal recorded vote was taken to gauge Senate support for the initial proposal, so there's no formal record of Ernst's support or opposition to that measure.\nMinutes after the two Democratic senators from Maryland rejected McConnell\u2019s ask to fast-track the measure, the pair proposed their own amendment which was double the dollar figure of McConnell\u2019s. It included $100 billion for hospitals dealing with COVID-19 and $150 billion for state and local governments.\nA final proposal to McConnell\u2019s original interim bill included $500 billion for hospitals, the Paycheck Protection Program and COVID-19 testing, but none for local government. The Senate approved that measure April 21 with unanimous consent, a procedural fast-tracking move that means no senators voiced opposition. Again, the Senate didn\u2019t record a vote tally, but Conley wrote to the DI in an email that Ernst supported that half-a-trillion-dollar bill.\nA day before the final proposal was approved in the Senate, Ernst said in an April 20 town hall, that she supported the $3.5 coronavirus relief bill\u2019s extra $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing.\n\"We will also get the additional dollars we wanted for diagnostic testing an additional $25 billion there as well as another $75 billion for our hospitals. And again this is something that I\u2019ve pushed for because we want to make sure that our rural hospitals are sustaining through this COVID-19 pandemic,\" Ernst said.\nConley wrote in an April 24 email to the Daily Iowan:\n\"Sen.\u00a0Ernst fully supports the additional funding for hospitals and testing \u2014\u00a0which are very much related to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 as she reiterated on Monday (April 20), and that's exactly why she supported the bill that passed the Senate this week. Her voting record shows, in no uncertain terms, that she supports those measures.\"\nIn other statements as well before the final interim package passed, Ernst reiterated her support for a narrower agreement.\nAccording to a RadioIowa report, Ernst said April 16 that discussions about extra funding for hospitals and local governments could wait until Congress passed the PPP funds.\n\"No political gimmicks, just a simple ask to put more money in this program,\" RadioIowa reported Ernst saying. \"Unfortunately, politics got in the way.\"\nIn a statement from Ernst\u2019s office April 9, the day Democrats and Republicans rejected each others\u2019 interim relief plans, Ernst criticized Democrats for rejecting Republicans\u2019 proposal, stating that passing small business loan relief funds was too urgent to delay.\n\"After hearing from Iowans and seeing the overwhelming response of small businesses across the country, it\u2019s clear we need to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program. We don\u2019t have time for political games; we\u2019re in a crisis. Workers and employers in Iowa and across the country need this relief now more than ever, so let\u2019s put aside the politics and swiftly get this specific additional support for small businesses approved so money can keep flowing, Iowa workers can continue to collect a paycheck, and our state\u2019s small businesses can stay afloat,\" Ernst said.\nCongress put $350 billion toward the PPP at it's creation. The program stopped taking applications when the funds ran dry April 16 date, and resumed taking applications April 27.\nThe interim package was one of several COVID-19 relief packages Congress has passed."}

There is no evidence that elections officials used Sharpies to invalidate ballots.\nWe rate the statement False.","full_article":"With Joe Biden edging closer to the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency, but with ballots in battleground states still being counted, President Donald Trump and his supporters made false charges of \"surprise ballot dumps\" and outright voter fraud.\nIt seemed no claim of efforts to deny Trump a second term was too far-fetched \u2014 even the notion that election workers, in plain view at polling sites, intentionally gave pens to Trump voters that would invalidate their ballots.\nThe text of one image shared widely on Facebook on Nov. 4, the day after the election, stated:\n\"If you were forced to use a Sharpie to fill your ballot, call the number below for your state. That is voter fraud.\"\n\"That is voter fraud\" appeared in red lettering in the image.\nThe image included a Sharpie pen and phone numbers identified as election hotlines for 15 states, primarily those that were battlegrounds for Trump and the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. (The first number we tried, for Ohio, was for a Trump campaign office. Democrats have their own \"voter protection\" hotlines, too.)\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nExperts say it is rare but not impossible that filling in an oval with a Sharpie marker could cause a \"bleed-through\" that would cause a voting machine to initially not read a ballot.\nBut in some states, election officials prefer Sharpies because they lead to ballots being processed more smoothly. And there is no evidence election workers gave out Sharpies with the aim to invalidate ballots, or that any widespread spoiling of Sharpie-penned ballots occurred.\nMatthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said he is \"not aware of cases where an election official said the Sharpie was fine and then the ballot was invalidated. Of course, every machine is different. But when the election officials themselves are saying this isn\u2019t a problem, I\u2019m going to believe them.\"\nArizona\u2019s Sharpiegate\nAs we found in a previous fact-check about Arizona, one version of the conspiracy theory is that Sharpies were foisted on Trump supporters because those markers wouldn\u2019t be read by election machines and those ballots would be invalidated. That\u2019s False.\nIn Maricopa County, Ariz., home to metropolitan Phoenix, voters could use ink pens to fill out their ballots, but the county gave Sharpie markers to voters because ballots filled in with Sharpie pens are processed more precisely by voting machines.\nFactCheck.org, Lead Stories and other fact-checkers reached similar conclusions. So did the New York Times. A USA Today fact-check rated a similar claim in Michigan as false.\nSince then, the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office, saying it had received hundreds of complaints from residents, asked the Maricopa County Elections Department for information about the use of Sharpies and any instances of ballots being rejected because of bleed-throughs.\nBut officials and experts have repeatedly knocked down #sharpiegate claims, which have been shared by the president\u2019s son, Eric Trump, among other Republicans.\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs tweeted on Nov. 4:\n\"IMPORTANT: If you voted a regular ballot in-person, your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!\"\nHere\u2019s what we know\nA letter dated Nov. 4 to voters from the Republican chairman and the only Democratic member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors explained why Sharpies were recommended and provided to voters.\n\"We did extensive testing on multiple different types of ink with our new vote tabulation equipment. Sharpies are recommended by the manufacturer because they provide the fastest-drying ink,\" it said. \"The offset columns on ballots ensure that any bleed-through will not affect your vote.\"\nThe federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s website addressed the Sharpie falsehood in a \"Rumor vs. Reality\" column about the election.\n\"If a ballot has issues that impact its ability to be scanned, it can be hand counted or duplicated, or adjudicated by election officials, who use defined procedures such as chain of custody to ensure ballot secrecy and integrity,\" the website states.\nThe Election Integrity Partnership, whose members include Stanford University and the University of Washington, was tracking #sharpiegate as it emerged on social media platforms. It called bleed-throughs rare and easily remedied per state \"voter intent\" laws.\n\"There is no evidence of a plot to disenfranchise voters by passing out Sharpies at polling stations,\" the group wrote.\nKatina Granger, spokeswoman for Election Systems and Software, a voting system vendor, told PolitiFact:\n\"We recommend black pens but, to be clear, black felt-tip pens such as a Sharpie are fine as long as there\u2019s not heavy bleed-through. Bleed-through is only an issue if the ink should bleed through to an oval on the back of the ballot. Should that occur, that is easily recognizable to the voter and the ballot is sorted out for further review.\""}

However, the proposed North Carolina merit commission would have a different role than in most other states. Its primary job would be to make sure candidates are legally qualified to serve as judges, rather than vet applicants.","full_article":"There must be a shift in the universe if all of the living former North Carolina governors, both Democratic and Republican, come together to take a stand against the actions of the General Assembly.\nWhat exactly is that cosmic force? A constitutional amendment that would take away the governor\u2019s sole power to appoint judges during vacancies, and hand it over to the General Assembly.\nDemocrats have decried the proposal as a seismic power shift, and a three-panel judge three-judge panel recently told the legislature (which is controlled by Republicans) to rewrite the amendment language.\nHow radical is this power shift, really?\nNot very, says House Speaker Tim Moore.\nMoore said on Aug. 24 that the proposed constitutional amendment \"actually puts us in line with what most other states do. Very few states allow a governor unilateral and sole discretion to pick those judges who continue to serve.\"\nWhat the proposal would change\nCurrently, in North Carolina, the governor has the full discretion to appoint someone to fill a vacant judicial seat to serve until the next general election. Judges in North Carolina are selected through partisan elections.\nThe constitutional amendment, if it passes, would lead to the creation of a Nonpartisan Judicial Merit Commission of no more than nine members. The members of the commission would be picked by the governor, the General Assembly and the state\u2019s chief justice. The commission would verify that all candidates who apply are legally qualified and assess their merit, without regard for party affiliation. The list of candidates then would go to the General Assembly, and lawmakers would pick at least two for the governor to choose from.\nIs this a revolutionary change? Not really.\nWhat other states do\nWhen PolitiFact reached out to Moore\u2019s office, spokesperson Joseph Kyzer cited a Ballotpedia page that says \"34 states and the District of Columbia use some variation of assisted appointment.\" The Ballotpedia information includes all states that use a merit commission in some form, including for first-term appointments, judicial vacancies or in combination with other methods.\nAccording to data from the New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, most states do actually have some type of merit commission in place to help select judges.\nWhen filling a state Supreme Court vacancy, 34 states do use some type of merit nominating commission during the process according to the data from the Brennan Center.\nOnly seven states currently allow the governor to directly fill state Supreme Court vacancies: Alabama, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas and Washington.\nWhen filling vacancies in state appellate courts, the Brennan Center reports, 23 states use a nominating commission. Meanwhile, 34 states use nominating commissions to fill vacant judgeships in trial courts.\nTypes of merit selection\nIt sounds as if most states do have some type of merit nominating commission, although there are a few differences in how they operate.\nMissouri was the\u00a0first state to have a merit commission in 1940. Its setup is often regarded as the \"gold standard\" merit commission plan. The Missouri State Bar, Governor and Supreme Court have an equal share in choosing commission members. Those members then elect who the head of the commission will be. The Missouri legislature has no say in the matter.\nBill Raftery,\u00a0a senior analyst at the National Center for State Courts, says some don\u2019t have the Missouri plan in place because states interpret \"merit commission\" differently and with varying degrees of involvement from legislators. He said because of that the term \"merit commission\" can be misleading by suggesting that a third party is involved in selecting judges.\nIn the proposed North Carolina commission, the General Assembly, Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would select the commission members. The state\u2019s current Chief Justice is Mark Martin, a Republican. He was elected in 2014 for an eight year term.\nAccording to information\u00a0from the nonpartisan American Judicature Society, seven states give their legislature some type of role in appointing commission members.\nAn NC nominating commission\nThat\u2019s not the only major difference between the proposed North Carolina commission and other commissions.\nIn the proposed amendment, the role of the commission would be to make sure the candidates are qualified to fill judicial vacancies, as prescribed by the law, without regard to their party affiliation. The commission\u2019s evaluation would then be sent to the General Assembly, who will choose at least two candidates for the governor to choose from.\n\"The nominating commission is only tasked with determining if the applicants meet the legal qualifications to be a judge, which is different than how nominating commissions are used in other states,\" said Douglas Keith, counsel in the Democracy program for the New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice.\nStephen Ware, a law professor at the University of Kansas, says that, based on the description in the ballot, the merit commission would play a less powerful role than in other states if its objective is to check \"legal requirements as opposed to assessing the pros and cons of applicants and making the hard choices of who would be better.\"\nIn fact, most merit commissions are tasked with \"narrowing down a pool of applicants to a few finalists\" for the governor or legislature to select from says Ware."}

A series of ensuing lawsuits and court actions have sought to more quickly remove these people from the voting rolls -- or delay that from happening.\nThe controversy caught the attention of U.S. House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.\nA Twitter account described as Pelosi\u2019s \"political account\" retweeted a statement from Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler and then offered its own take on the situation.\n\"It\u2019s beyond alarming that more than 200,000 registered Wisconsin voters will be prohibited from voting,\" the\u00a0tweet said.\nThe tweet does not appear to have been sent by Pelosi herself, since it was not signed with her initials, a style referenced in the account\u00a0description.\nThere\u2019s clearly room for disagreement over how to handle the 234,000 voters.\nBut Pelosi\u2019s claim is a significant exaggeration of what\u2019s at stake.\nHere\u2019s why.\nThe background\nThe controversy began in October 2019 when the Wisconsin Elections Commission sent letters to 234,000 voters it believed may have moved because of information it received from the post office, Division of Motor Vehicles or other government entities. That\u2019s 7% of the 3.3\u00a0million registered voters in the state.\nThe letters asked recipients to re-register at their new address if they had moved or to confirm they were still at their same address if they hadn't.\nRelated: Here's what Wisconsin voters should do to ensure they're registered properly\nAll of this is a big deal in Wisconsin, a state President\u00a0Donald Trump won by less than 23,000 votes in 2016, a key factor in his victory.\nOfficials have refused to release the names of those who received the letters, but a\u00a0Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis of the mailings showed 55% went to municipalities won by Democrat\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016. A higher percentage of voters received the mailings in traditional Democratic strongholds, such as Milwaukee, Madison and many college towns.\nState officials want to put off forcing people off the rolls until 2021, not wanting to affect the 2020 election since they aren\u2019t certain all of those people actually moved.\nIndeed, as of Dec. 5, 2019, the Elections Commission said 2,300 recipients had responded to the letter to report they still lived at the same address. By that point, 16,500 recipients had also registered to vote at new addresses, and 60,000 letters had been returned as undeliverable.\nBut a lawsuit brought in November by three voters with the help of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty argued election officials were required to remove voters from the rolls 30 days after sending the letters if they hadn't heard from them.\nOn Dec. 13, 2019, an Ozaukee County\u00a0judge ruled those people should be removed immediately.\nFour days later, Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed notice the state would appeal and seek to stay the judge\u2019s ruling. The same day, the left-leaning League of Women Voters of Wisconsin filed suit in federal court to try to stop voter names from being purged.\nThe claim\nSo what happens to the 234,000 voters?\nThe claim by Pelosi, via her Twitter account, is that they will be \"prohibited\" from voting.\nBut anyone in this group has multiple opportunities to regain their status as registered voters. Voters who are removed from the rolls \u2014 correctly or not \u2014 can re-register online, at their clerk's office or even at the polls on Election Day.\nWisconsin is one of 21 states that allows voters to register at their polling place the day of the election, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nAddressing this at the polls would mean filling out paperwork and providing proof of residence such as a driver's license, property tax bill, utility bill, bank statement, paycheck stub, lease or workplace ID. That means some people \u2014 we have no idea how many \u2014 could be unable to vote if they can\u2019t provide proof of residence at the polls and don\u2019t re-register beforehand.\nThe Pelosi tweet was made in the context of the 2020 election, but the next chance for Wisconsin residents to vote is the spring primary on Feb. 18, 2020. So it does leave a narrow window to get reregistered before the election.\nThat said, the 234,000 people who received the letter are not prohibited from voting.\nThe Elections Commission stated this explicitly in the Oct. 10, 2019, announcement that the letters were being sent.\n\"This mailing is designed to help people who may have moved within Wisconsin make sure they\u2019re ready to vote next year,\"\u00a0 said Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin\u2019s chief elections official. \"It will not keep anyone eligible from voting.\"\nWhen asked for evidence supporting the tweet, a Pelosi spokesman acknowledged the ability to re-register but largely reiterated the same overstated claim.\n\"Of course, if people re-register, they will be able to vote,\" said Jorge Aguilar. \"If the purge goes through, people will be de-registered and not be allowed to vote.\""}

But Priorities USA\u2019s ad is missing a bit of context, so we rate it Half True.","full_article":"Donald Trump would be \"too dangerous for America,\" says a new ad from Priorities USA Action, a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton.\nThe 30-second ad, which will air in eight battleground states, features several of Trump\u2019s own comments about foreign policy. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd played a portion of the ad on the June 19 show as an example of the kind of ads Trump can expect to face in the general election.\nIt starts with MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski asking Trump, \"Who are you consulting with consistently so that you are ready on day one?\"\n\"I\u2019m speaking with myself, number one,\" he responds.\nThen the ad cuts to four more of Trump\u2019s comments:\n\"This is the Trump theory on war\u2026 I\u2019m really good at war. \u00a0I love war in a certain way.\"\n\"Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\"\n\"I want to be unpredictable, I\u2019m not going to tell you right now what I\u2019m gonna do.\"\n\"I know more about ISIS than the generals. Believe me.\"\nThe \"nukes\" comment in particular caught our attention. It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s separate from the preceding comment \u2014 \"I love war in a certain way\" \u2014 but the implication seems to be that Trump is a warmonger who isn\u2019t afraid to use nuclear weapons.\nWe decided to check out the context of both of those comments and see if the ad is fairly representing Trump's\u00a0position. We also looked at Trump\u2019s overall views on nuclear policy.\n\u2018I love war in a certain way.\u2019\nThis comment comes from a 90-minute\u00a0speech in Iowa on Nov. 12, 2015. In the speech, Trump theorized that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein feigned having weapons of mass destruction to scare neighboring Iran, before briefly sidetracking into his feelings on war generally.\n\"This is the Trump theory on war,\" he said. \"But I'm good at war. I've had a lot of wars of my own. I'm really good at war. I love war in a certain way. But only when we win.\"\nHe then moved on to talking about veterans. Earlier in his speech, he railed against the decision to invade Iraq.\n\u2018Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\u2019\nTrump made his comments about \"nukes\" in an April 3 interview with Fox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace. Wallace was asking Trump about his suggestion that Japan might be better off with nuclear weapons.\nWallace: \"You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?\"\nTrump: \"In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.\"\nWallace: \"Understood.\"\nTrump: \"It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.\"\nWallace: \"With nukes?\"\nTrump: \"Maybe they would be better off \u2014 including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\"\nSo Trump was saying Japan might do well to defend itself with its own nuclear weapons, rather than talking about what he would do as president with the United States\u2019 own nuclear arsenal.\nThe way the ad splices Trump's comments together, a reasonable person would think Trump \"loves war,\" including \"with nukes.\"\nPriorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky told us that the fact Trump is open to more countries having nuclear weapons supports the ad\u2019s overarching argument \u2014 that Trump would be too dangerous.\nOther comments\nTrump has offered somewhat conflicting views on using nuclear weapons throughout the campaign.\nHe has said he \"wouldn\u2019t rule out\" using tactical nuclear weapons against ISIS, but adding in the same interview: \"Definitely nuclear weapons are a last resort.\"\nNor would he rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe, if a conflict ever were to arise.\n\"You don\u2019t want to, say, take everything off the table,\" he said.\nHe also told the New York Times, \"It\u2019s a very scary nuclear world.

It did not specify any certain municipality and therefore is factually accurate,\" he wrote.\nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union's website, 22 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The District and 19 states also ban discrimination based on gender identity. That makes Florida\u00a0one of 28 states with no statewide protection against discrimination."}

But is the science unsettled on whether young people should receive the vaccine or wear masks at school, as Elder claims?\nWe found the science is more clear than Elder makes it out to be.\nNumerous leading scientific organizations recommend children, ages 12 and up, should receive the vaccine and wear masks at school to protect their health and slow the pandemic.\nGroups That Recommend Young People Receive The COVID-19 Vaccine\nWe found the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics all recommend young people receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\"The data continue to show that this vaccine is safe and effective,\" said Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a press release in May. \"I urge all parents to call their pediatrician to learn more about how to get their children and teens vaccinated.\"\nElder was correct in the CNN interview when he said that children tend to get more mild cases of COVID-19 than adults and are not hospitalized at the same rate. But cases are rising sharply among adolescents as the delta variant spreads across the country.\nNationally, nearly 94,000 child cases of COVID-19 were recorded for the week ending Aug. 5, up from 72,000 cases the week before and up from 39,000 two weeks earlier, NPR reported, based on data from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.\nOn its website, the CDC recommends \"everyone 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 vaccination to help protect against COVID-19.\" It describes the vaccine as \u00a0safe and effective, and a critical tool to help stop the pandemic.\nTimetable For COVID-19 Vaccine For Children Under 12\nWe also looked at Elder\u2019s claim that he doesn\u2019t \"believe the science suggests\" young people should be vaccinated in the context of children under 12. For this group, we found the examination of vaccine data isn\u2019t complete, but no indication that vaccines will be unsafe for these younger children once authorized.\nAs many parents of young children know, the COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been authorized for kids under 12 because the FDA is still collecting data to evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness for these age groups.\nIn July, the FDA expanded vaccine trials for children under 12 \"to more closely examine rare but serious instances, particularly in young boys, in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed,\" or myocarditis, the Washington Post reported. It said this has pushed the timetable to early 2022.\nThere have been more than 1,000 reports of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, a similar condition where the lining of the outside of the heart becomes inflamed, after some COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States, according to the CDC.\n\"Considering the hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses that have been administered, these reports are very rare,\" reported Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in a fact sheet about the vaccines for parents. \"The problem occurs more often in adolescents [teens] and young adults, and in males. The myocarditis or pericarditis in almost all cases is mild and resolves quickly.\"\nOn its website, the CDC says side effects in adolescents, including possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis, \"are rare and the known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks.\"\n\"COVID-19 vaccines have been used under the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, which includes studies in adolescents,\" the CDC website adds.\nDr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told NPR last month that Pfizer and Moderna \"are still collecting trial data, trying to understand \u2014 among other things \u2014 whether young children should receive a smaller vaccine dose than what has already been approved for adults.\"\nThat indicates work is ongoing to ensure the right dose of the vaccine is authorized for young children. Elder\u2019s claim that the science suggests young people shouldn\u2019t receive the vaccine is not supported.\nIn May, the FDA approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis. The vaccine had been available for everyone age 16 and older in the United States since April.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, recently said that a vaccine could be available to young children \"hopefully by the mid, late fall and early winter.\"\nThe World Health Organization is one leading group that says children should not be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccinations. But as PolitiFact reported in June, that\u2019s not because the WHO takes issue with its safety or effectiveness.\nInstead, the WHO believes health care workers, front-line workers, the elderly and those with high-risk medical conditions should be at the front of the line because children develop less severe cases than adults and vaccine supplies are limited in many countries.\nThe Science On Wearing Masks At Schools\nWe also examined Elder\u2019s claim that young people shouldn\u2019t have to wear masks because the science isn\u2019t \"settled\" on that. Again, we found the science is more certain than Elder makes it out to be.\nLeading scientific organizations, including the CDC and AAP, recommend students wear masks at schools, saying they reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nOn its website, the CDC recommends \"universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.\"\nIt describes mask use as one of several ways to reduce transmission in schools, along with ventilation, hand-washing and physical distancing.\n\"Although outbreaks in schools can occur, multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than \u2013 or at least similar to \u2013 levels of community transmission, when prevention strategies are in place in schools,\" the CDC reported in July, adding that inconsistent mask use can contribute to outbreaks.\nSince the start of the pandemic, PolitiFact has examined the science behind using masks to slow transmission and debunked myths about them. It\u2019s found masks are most effective as \"source control,\" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people.\nNow that students are back on campus in California and across the country, health officials say vaccines and universal mask requirements will be key to keeping in-person learning safe and open.\n\"Masking is likely the second most important thing [behind vaccinations] to prevent transmission and allow children to go to schools and have in-person learning safely,\" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children\u2019s Hospital in Sacramento.\nBlumberg added that wearing a standard surgical mask or double layer fabric mask reduces a person\u2019s chance of infection by about 70%.\n\"If you want to avoid having that outbreak that's going to send all the kids home again, you should be doing everything to avoid that. And that means wearing masks,\" Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, added in the NPR interview.\nIn July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration issued guidance calling for universal masking at K-12 public schools statewide. Newsom later said it would allow local school districts to decide how to deal with students who refuse to wear a mask, sparking confusion about whether the guidance is a requirement.\nElder\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for evidence supporting his statement."}

There are a lot of these types of claims going around. I would love to see their data,\" Fauci responded.\nThe next mention of hydroxychloroquine in the email dump occurred April 11, 2020, when Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., asked whether there were any cases of lupus patients contracting COVID-19.\n\"The answer is almost certainly yes, but there would not be enough of them whereby we can compare the results in those who were receiving hydroxychloroquine or not for their lupus,\" Fauci responded. \"Large natural history studies, which we will be initiating, could possibly answer that question.\"\nIn other emails asking about the drug, Fauci did acknowledge there were anecdotal accounts about hydroxychloroquine\u2019s effectiveness but said he was waiting on results from a then-ongoing clinical trial conducted by the National Institutes of Health looking into whether the drug could be used as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\"We will know soon whether hydroxychloroquine has any beneficial effects as the results of randomized, controlled trials become available,\" he said in one email sent May 1, 2020.\nAt no point in any of the emails sent by Fauci did he say himself that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment. However, around the time of the emails, then-President Donald Trump was touting its alleged benefits.\nFauci\u2019s emails echo past statements he\u2019s made publicly about the drug, acknowledging the anecdotal evidence but withholding any official position until a clinical trial is completed.\nThe study conducted by the NIH was eventually halted in June 2020 after it found hydroxychloroquine was \"very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\"\n\"The data from this study indicate that this drug provided no additional benefit compared to placebo control for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,\" according to a statement from the NIH.\nAt the same time, the FDA revoked the emergency use authorization it had issued for the drug\u00a0 three months prior. In addition to the NIH study finding no benefit to taking hydroxychloroquine, the FDA said taking the drug could potentially lead to serious side effects including \"serious cardiac adverse events\" and that any potential benefits \"no longer outweigh the known and potential risks.\"\nMisinformation attempting to connect Fauci and his knowledge about hydroxychloroquine is not new. PolitiFact previously debunked a claim in 2020 alleging he knew as early as 2005 the drug was capable of treating coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19 and actively advocated against its use.\nThe Facebook post also claims Fauci knew face masks did not work to stop the virus, which we rated False."}

Cloth masks are not effective for filtering wildfire smoke.\n\"Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke,\" the health agency says on its website. \"They do not catch small, harmful particles in smoke that can harm your health. Although N95 respirators do provide protection from wildfire smoke, they might be in short supply as frontline healthcare workers use them during the pandemic.\"\nWhen it comes to COVID-19, the CDC recommends people wear cloth masks as a form of source control \u2014 if the wearer coughs, sneezes, laughs or talks, the mask blocks their respiratory droplets from spreading to others. The CDC recommends that adults and children two years and older wear a mask to help limit the spread of the virus, especially when social distancing isn\u2019t possible.\n\"Cloth masks and medical masks used in health care settings (such as surgical or procedure masks) are important tools in the fight against the spread of COVID-19, however, they are not a type of respiratory protection,\" the agency says.\nRELATED: Face masks, including homemade ones, are effective COVID-19 protection, experts say\nRespiratory protection refers to respirators, like N95 masks, to help reduce the wearer\u2019s exposure from breathing in air that contains contaminants, such as small respiratory droplets from a person who has COVID-19.\nSource control, on the other hand, protects others and refers to the use of masks to help reduce the spread of large respiratory droplets to others when the person talks, sneezes or coughs.\nThe post\u2019s claim that \"smoke particles are far larger than SARS-CoV-2 particles\" is misleading because both come in several different size ranges.\n\"There are particles of all sizes. Some smoke particles are larger, but there are also ultra-fine particles that are down in the size range of the airborne virus,\" said Dr. John Balmes, professor of environmental health sciences at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.\nBalmes also told PolitiFact it\u2019s correct that cloth masks generally don\u2019t offer much protection against wildfire smoke particles, because smaller ones\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 particularly the microscopic particles that are about 2.5 microns in size \u2014 can get through the cloth. But that isn\u2019t the point for COVID-19.\n\"It's not to protect the wearer from other people, it's to protect other people from the wearer,\" Balmes said. \"Respiratory droplets, which are what we cough and squeeze, are big enough to be contained inside the masks, but they don't protect breathing in really fine particles.\""}

Sixteen states have allowed for medical monitoring claims, while 13 state have rejected those claims. Some courts lay out more stringent criteria for medical monitoring tests, based on significance of exposure, extent of increased risk and seriousness of latent disease.\nHowever, not all courts include those qualifiers in their tests for medical monitoring. S.37 also sets limits on what types of businesses could be sued for medical monitoring in a way that other courts have not done. And a judge in a Vermont federal court has issued a preliminary ruling that could set an arguably less strict threshold for medical monitoring claims than S.37.\nWe rate this claim Half True.","full_article":"A multi-year debate over Vermonters\u2019 right to medical monitoring, supported by environmental advocates and loathed by industry, bubbled to the surface during a recent House debate.\nUnder tort law, people who sue traditionally need to show proof of an injury to be awarded damages. Starting in the 1980s, some courts in the U.S. began awarding plaintiffs exposed to hazardous substances payment for diagnostic tests and other procedures for early detection of diseases they face an increased risk of developing due to exposure. Those cases are referred to as \"medical monitoring\" claims.\nBennington\u2019s two senators, Democrats Dick Sears and Brian Campion, had sponsored a bill, S.37, in response to the contamination of private wells\u00a0around Bennington with PFOA from the ChemFab plant in town.\nUnder S.37, Vermonters without a disease would have a \"cause of action\" to sue a company that exposed them to toxic substances through wrongful conduct for medical monitoring costs. Before awarding medical monitoring, a court would have to find that the exposure increases the risk of developing a disease. A medical expert would also have to deem that diagnostic testing beyond normal medical checkups to be reasonably necessary.\nOnly businesses of 10 or more employees \u2014 or of 500 or more employees at multiple facilities \u2014 in the mining, manufacturing, transportation and utility sectors could be sued for medical monitoring costs under S.37.\nThe state discovered the Bennington area contamination in 2016. The Department of Health offered Bennington area residents testing for PFOA levels\u00a0in their blood.\nPFOA is one of the most toxic chemicals of the man-made PFAS chemicals. PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, do not break down in the environment and are used in a wide array of manufactured products, from rain jackets to cookware to firefighting foam. Scientists now know that exposure to certain PFAS chemicals can lead to cancer, thyroid disease, immune system damages, developmental problems in children and low birth weight.Proponents of the medical monitoring bill argue that companies that release toxic pollutants -- not the state or exposed individuals -- should have to pay for that medical testing.\nA similar proposal was vetoed last year by Gov. Phil Scott, who said it created an \"unprecedented\" level of liability\u00a0for Vermont businesses.\nDuring a House floor debate on the bill last week, Rep. Scott Beck, R-St. Johnsbury, introduced an amendment to S.37\u00a0favored by industry representatives that sets more stringent criteria for people in an exposed area to receive medical monitoring.\nMultiple lawmakers rose to speak in favor of the amendment. Rep. Heidi Scheuermann, R-Stowe, said representatives from the manufacturing industry \"came to Montpelier this year\" with the intent of supporting medical monitoring legislation.\n\"They understand the importance (of medical monitoring),\" she said on the House floor last Thursday, referring to industry. \"It\u2019s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn\u2019t.\"\nSen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, and Sen. Bobby Starr, D-Essex-Orleans, echoed similar concerns during Senate floor debate on the bill this week.\nThe bill passed both the House and the Senate, but is unlikely to get the governor's signature.\nSo we were wondering, if S.37 becomes law, would Vermont be an outlier compared to the rest of the country?\nIn an interview Wednesday, Scheuermann said that her statement came from concerns expressed by industry representatives and lobbyists. In particular, they felt the so-called \"test\" for medical monitoring in S.37 was too lenient and would impact their ability to obtain insurance, she said.\n\"GlobalFoundries testified, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce testified, (Associated Industries of Vermont) testified, all pointing out the specifics of how it is out of line with other states and what that impact could be to manufacturers in our state and their ability to obtain liability insurance,\" she said.\nScheuermann also directed VTDigger to a state-by-state comparison\u00a0of medical monitoring from Jill Rickard, director of policy at the state Department of Financial Regulation.\nIn Rickard\u2019s comparison, five of the six states and territories referenced \u2014 Guam, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Florida \u2014 require plaintiffs demonstrate either significant exposure to a toxic substance or exposure greater than background levels. Courts in Guam, Florida and Pennsylvania all say that the plaintiff must have a \"significantly\" increased risk of contracting a \"serious\" latent disease.\nBeck\u2019s amendment would have required exposure to a toxic substance be \"significant.\" It also would have changed \"greater risk of contracting a latent disease\" to a \"significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease.\"\nThe argument between industry representative and environmental advocates on the latest version centers on whether or not to include those adjectives in the medical monitoring test in S.37.\nThere is little disagreement that if S.37 is signed by Gov. Phil Scott, Vermont would be the first state in the country to put the right to sue for medical monitoring into state law, and not leave the decision only to a court. So far, courts in 16 states have recognized medical monitoring claims, while 13 states have denied those claims, arguing a medical condition must arise first, according to a white paper\u00a0by Ken Rumelt, a professor at Vermont Law School.\nThis week, 38 industry associations around the state sent a letter to senators, urging them to vote against the bill.\n\"The major flaw with this legislation is that it is not consistent with what courts in other states have held regarding medical monitoring claims,\" the groups wrote in the letter. \"This will increase operational risks and costs for a wide range of Vermont employers, and make Vermont an outlier even compared to other states that have recognized this as a remedy for plaintiffs.\"\nState and federal courts in nine jurisdictions include the requirement that the plaintiff show they are at a \"significantly increased risk\" of developing a \"serious\" disease, according to a handout from an industry lobbyist. And courts in seven jurisdictions require the plaintiff to show that exposure was either \"significant\" or \"above background levels.\"\nBut proponents of the bill argue that the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not that different than in other jurisdictions.\n\"Despite what you have heard, the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not materially different than the test that exists in other states,\" wrote Jon Groveman, policy and water program director for Vermont Natural Resources Council, and Ken Rumelt, senior attorney at Vermont Law School, in testimony\u00a0at the end of April.\nThey go on to write that, in some ways, the bill would set \"more stringent\" conditions for medical monitoring claims than other states. For example, no other states have limited medical monitoring claims to large facilities or specific industries like in S.37.\nGroveman and Rumelt also reference a case pending in federal court\u00a0brought by Bennington residents exposed to PFOA seeking medical monitoring costs, among other damages. Judge Geoffrey Crawford issued a preliminary ruling in the ongoing Bennington case that lays out a less strict test than in S.37, they say.\nIn a white paper he prepared for Vermont Natural Resources Council and VPIRG, Rumelt describes the \"high bar\" plaintiffs must prove to qualify for medical monitoring from West Virginia\u2019s Bower case. Under that eight-part test, plaintiffs must show they\u2019ve been \"significantly exposed\" to a proven hazardous substance, putting them at an increased risk for developing a \"serious latent disease.\"\n\"I think it\u2019s, to a large degree, equivalent to the Bower\u2019s test,\" Rumelt said of S.37.\nIn the Bower case, \"significant exposure\" is defined as the plaintiff being exposed to a hazardous substance.\nRumelt and other proponents of the bill say that the requirement in S.37 that a physician has to testify that a plaintiff\u2019s exposure would make additional testing beyond what is generally prescribed \"reasonably necessary\" speaks to the significance of exposure and seriousness of disease.\nIn an email, Groveman listed tests for medical monitoring in some of the states where courts have allowed it. California does require a plaintiff to show the \"significance and extent of exposure\" and the \"seriousness of diseases for which the plaintiff is at an increased risk,\" but \u00a0does not require the plaintiff to show that he or she is at a seriously increased risk.\nIn Utah, the plaintiff must show that exposure puts them at risk of developing a \"serious disease, illness or injury\" but not that there was significant exposure or a significantly increased risk. In Missouri, there is not a list of elements, but the court allowed a claim when a plaintiff has a \"significantly increased risk of contracting a particular disease relative to what would be the case in the absence of exposure.\"\nAnd in New York, courts are all over the map in whether or not they recognize medical monitoring claims.\nIn a class action case ruling involving the National Hockey League Players\u2019 Concussion Injury Litigation, the U.S. District Court of Minnesota reviewed medical monitoring common law throughout the country. The plaintiffs had sought to group together 28 jurisdictions that they claim allow medical monitoring.\n\"Plaintiffs\u2019 grouping theory cannot be used to sidestep the widespread divergence among the states in the requirements for medical monitoring,\" Judge Susan Richard Nelson writes.\nIn her conclusion, Nelson cites \"widespread differences in the applicable state laws governing medical monitoring\" as a reason not to grant class certification to the plaintiffs."}

It increases the risk of an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to cardiac arrest.\nTrump didn\u2019t mention that. He did, however, dismiss the research that cast doubt on whether the drug does any good against COVID-19.\n\"If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\" Trump said at a May 19 press event. \"They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.\"\nLater that day, Trump clarified that he was talking about a study of Veterans Administration patients.\nTrump spoke as if there were only one negative study. There have been three: the one on VA patients and two larger ones. They all reached the same conclusion that outcomes with hydroxychloroquine were the same as without it.\nThe studies\nThe earliest work on hydroxychloroquine was small studies, sometimes with as few as 30 patients, and for each study that showed promise, another study found no benefit. The mixed results spurred more research.\nThe analysis Trump criticized came in late April, when researchers at the universities of South Carolina and Virginia released their paper on 368 VA patients with COVID-19. They looked at who got hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or both, and they tracked who ended up on a ventilator or died. The paper was released without peer review.\nThey found that hydroxychloroquine, with or without the other drug, had no effect on whether someone had to be put on a ventilator. Worse, hydroxychloroquine increased the chances of dying.\nThe authors cautioned that all of the patients involved in the study, regardless of outcome, were men over 65. And they also factored in a range of underlying conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and other health risks. Those issues were found in roughly equal numbers across all groups of patients. Ultimately, about 75% of the patients getting hydroxychloroquine lived. The survival rate was close to 90% for those who didn\u2019t get it.\nTrump ignores larger, newer studies\nIn early May, two studies emerged based on patients treated in the nation\u2019s biggest COVID-19 hotspot, New York City. Both investigations were much larger than the study of VA patients.\nThe study that appeared May 7 in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the medical records of 1,376 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. Their results echoed the first study on hydroxychloroquine.\n\"There was no association between administration of the drug and a lower chance of dying or winding up on a respirator,\" said co-author Neil Schluger, the head of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\nNow, it\u2019s fair to say that the patients who got the drug were, as a group, a bit worse off than those who didn\u2019t. In particular, their blood oxygen levels were lower when they were first admitted. Schluger said that didn\u2019t matter.\n\"The difference in oxygen levels between the two groups we compared were fairly small and not clinically important,\" Schluger said.\nThese patients were not close to death, Schluger said.\n\"Overall, about 83% of the patients in our cohort survived, and that survival had no association with hydroxychloroquine administration,\" he said.\nOn May 11, the JAMA Network of the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study of 1,438 randomly selected COVID-19 patients treated at 25 New York area hospitals. That group of researchers tracked whether they died in the hospital. They, too, found no connection between outcomes and use of hydroxychloroquine. They also found no impact from the use of another drug, azithromycin. About 75% of patients getting hydroxychloroquine survived, compared with about 87% who were not given the drug.\nLike the other study, this one found that patients who got the drug were in worse health at admission than those who didn\u2019t. They might have lower oxygen levels, or some other condition such as diabetes or obesity.\nBut by examining patients\u2019 full medical records, both teams were able to use stronger analytic tools to filter out the impact of differences in underlying health. Once that was done, they could make apples-to-apples comparisons of the effect of hydroxychloroquine on people who got the drug and those who didn\u2019t.\nThe authors of all studies acknowledged that working with patient records after the fact isn\u2019t the final answer, and they called for more research.\nWe reached out to the White House and did not hear back."}

But he himself did not \"design\" the logo.\nThis history doesn\u2019t change the fact that numerous American Indian tribes and advocacy groups, including ones Wetzel was affiliated with, have called for the team to change its name and imagery for years.\nMembers of Wetzel\u2019s family told media outlets that they\u2019re sad to see the logo go, but agreed the name needs to be changed.\nFirst, some history\nThe team was initially based in Boston and was called the Braves before former owner George Preston Marshall gave it the latest name in 1933. The team relocated to Washington, D.C. in 1937 and received the first of its trademarks for the name in 1967.\nIn 1972, Native American leaders representing multiple organizations requested that the team change its name, calling it a derogatory racial epithet.\nWetzel, who had served as the Blackfeet tribal chairman and president of the National Congress of American Indians, asked team executives that same year to drop the \"R\" logo that was used at the time in favor of a profile of an Indian warrior.\nWetzel spoke with the Washington Post in 2002, shortly before he died, and said he had told the team he\u2019d like to see an Indian on their helmets instead of the big R.\nWithin weeks, the team had a new logo based on a composite of Native American photographs, including one of early 20th-century Blackfeet chief, Two Guns White Calf.\n\"It made us all so proud to have an Indian on a big-time team,\" Wetzel told the paper, \"It's only a small group of radicals who oppose those names. Indians are proud of Indians.\"\nAlmost five decades later, Wetzel\u2019s family expressed mixed reactions to the team\u2019s announcement.\nHis grandson, Bill Wetzel, told the Great Falls, Mont., Tribune (which is based about two hours from the Blackfeet Indian Reservation) that his grandfather was a good, honest man, and it bothered him that his grandfather\u2019s name had been associated with a racial slur, but that times had changed.\nJacob Wetzel, his great-grandson, told the paper that while the name change is \"long overdue,\" he was still sad to see the family legacy go.\nThe NCAI, which describes itself as the country\u2019s oldest, largest and most representative American Indian and Alaska Native advocacy organization, has pushed for the team to drop the name and imagery for years.\nThe organization commended the team for its decision.\n\"We thank the generations of tribal nations, leaders, and activists who worked for decades to make this day possible. We commend the Washington NFL team for eliminating a brand that disrespected, demeaned, and stereotyped all Native people, and we call on all other sports teams and corporate brands to retire all caricatures of Native Americans that they use as their mascots,\" the group said in a statement.\n\"We are not mascots \u2014 we are Native people, citizens of more than 500 tribal nations who have stood strong for millennia and overcome countless challenges to reach this pivotal moment in time when we can help transform America into the just, equitable, and compassionate country our children deserve,\" it said.\nBut not all tribal members agree with the name change. Some say that the logo has been a point of pride, while others say teams like Washington that use Native American mascots are guilty of cultural appropriation and exploitation."}

In the Cambridge Analytica case, users only knew were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes.\nThe Obama campaign used the data to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends. Cambridge Analytica targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads.\nWhereas the data gathering and the uses were very different, the data each campaign gained access to was similar. We rate this statement Half True.\nUpdate, April 11, 2018: This story has been updated to include additional information about Facebook\u2019s audience tool.","full_article":"As news reports surfaced of Cambridge Analytica and\u00a0the Donald Trump campaign, conservatives pointed to what seemed a double-standard.\nOn ABC\u2019s The View, co-host Meghan McCain said former President Barack Obama was met with praise when he used similar Facebook data for his campaign, whereas Trump was met with outrage.\n\"It happened under Obama and it was lauded by the media as being genius,\" McCain said. \"And now under the Trump campaign \u2014 it\u2019s the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\"\n\"Was it the same thing?\" co-host Joy Behar asked.\n\"Yeah,\" McCain said. \"It was micro-targeting and data mining.\"\n\"I think it\u2019s different, though,\" said co-host Sunny Hostin.\n\"It\u2019s not different, though!\" McCain exclaimed.\nSo, was it the same thing?\nWhile the data the two campaigns had access to was largely the same, the way they accessed it, and for what purpose, was very different.\n\"She was making the point that the Obama re-election campaign used a similar tactic through Facebook to gain access to the personal information of millions of voters,\" ABC spokeswoman Lauri Hogan clarified.\nThe data\nUnder the way Facebook allowed its apps to operate between 2010 and 2015, Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election app and the survey app used by Cambridge Analytica had access not only to their users\u2019 profiles but their friends\u2019 list and their biographical information.\nWhen the user approved it, these apps could access details such as users\u2019 and their friends\u2019 tags, likes and demographics.\nOver a million people downloaded the Obama for America app. Around 300,000 people downloaded the personality survey app that ended up sending their data to\u00a0Cambridge Analytica. The number\u00a0of users\u2019 data the firm reportedly gained access to (50 million) is much higher because it includes the users\u2019 friends. The number of user data, it follows, was much higher for the Obama campaign, too.\nHow it was accessed\nThe real divergence is in the way each campaign accessed the data.\nThe Obama campaign created a Facebook app for supporters to donate, learn of voting requirements, and find nearby houses to canvass. The app asked users\u2019 permission to scan their photos, friends lists, and news feeds. Most users complied.\nThe people signing up knew the data they were handing over would be used to support a political campaign. Their friends, however, did not.\nThe people who downloaded the app used by Cambridge Analytica did not know their data would be used to aid any political campaigns. The app was billed as a personality quiz that would be used by Cambridge University researchers.\nAleksandr Kogan, one of the Cambridge researchers involved in the project, sold the data to the upstart political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The company then sold its services not only to the Trump campaign, but to the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz and the senatorial campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., among others.\nWhen Facebook discovered a developer had shared users\u2019 data without their consent in 2015, it asked both the original app and the consultancy to delete the data. That didn\u2019t happen.\n\"The thing that is true is that every Facebook app you downloaded back then was getting access to your entire friends list,\" said David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. \"When tech people were trying to raise outrage about it they were being ignored. Now, everyone is outraged. But what (McCain) is wrong about this is that Kogan then sold it, and for a much creepier purpose.\"\nHow it was used\nObama operatives used Facebook data to get users to send their messaging for them, according to Eitan Hersh, a Tufts professor who wrote Hacking the Electorate, a book on Obama\u2019s microtargeting strategies.\nFacebook friends lists, tags and photos allowed Obama operatives to identify a person\u2019s close friends, which they then matched with offline public records. (Was this person likely to vote for Obama, but unlikely to get out to vote?) They then told the app users which of their friends they should send campaign messages to.\nCambridge Analytica dialed up what Karpf called the creepiness factor. They combined the survey results with the Facebook data to create psychological profiles they then sold to campaigns. The idea was, if the firm could\u00a0discover how these people thought, they could target ads toward them.\nCambridge Analytica then sent targeted ads to the users on their database as well as users with similar profiles, identified by Facebook\u2019s Lookalike tool.\u00a0The friends of the app users weren\u2019t being targeted by their friends, but by the campaign itself. In other words, the consenting middle man was gone.\nIn his research, Hersh found that neither tactic was greatly effective at persuading\u00a0people to vote."}

Were more machines allocated to Republican primary voters than to Democrats in Texas?\nClinton\u2019s team did not return a request for comment.\nDifferences by county\nIn Texas, elections are conducted at the local level and procedures differ in each of the state\u2019s 254 counties.\nFor example, in Travis, Harris and Tarrant counties, voters can go to any polling place within the county to vote in the primary and general elections. In other counties, voters are restricted to polling places within the precincts where they live.\nDuring primary elections, both political parties work with election officials to agree on how the elections are run \u2014 including selecting the number of polling places and how voting machines are allocated.\nIn Travis County, which also saw long lines, Democrats and Republicans can vote using the same machines at any polling place during the primary.\nSome polling places in the county saw staffing disruptions early in the day that caused delays, as eleven people responsible for opening different polling locations did not show up for work over fears of catching the coronavirus.\nIn Harris County, an equal number of voting machines for each party was placed at every polling place.\nMichael Winn, Harris County\u2019s elections supervisor, told the Austin American-Statesman that this created longer lines for Democratic voters since the Democratic ballot drew more interest than the Republican one, and the county has more Democratic voters.\nWinn said people in Harris County voted in the Democratic primary at a 2-to-1 ratio compared with Republicans \u2014 but two-thirds of voting centers were located in Republican commissioner districts.\nLocal party officials expressed trepidation at Harris County\u2019s plan to divide voting machines equally in emails obtained by the Houston Chronicle.\nIn one Feb. 18 message to county staff, Donna Stanart, the primary election director for the Republican Party wrote: \"A 50\/50 split will be a problem at the polls that are going to be heavier for Democrats or heavier for Republicans.\"\nHarris County Clerk Diane Trautman said in a statement that officials initially believed they were being \"fair and equitable by allocating equal amounts of equipment to each party.\"\nIn Tarrant County, election officials warned of long lines on Super Tuesday after local party officials agreed to have a set number of voting machines for each party, based on a review of past voter turnout data.\nThe plan called for 1,015 Democratic machines and 1,767 Republican machines across the county\u2019s 192 polling sites, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\nState lawmakers plan to hold a hearing to investigate the excessive wait times voters experienced and other issues reported by news outlets on Super Tuesday.\nIn a letter to the Texas secretary of state and a handful of local election administrators urging action on improving voting infrastructure in the state, Mimi Marziani, president of the nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project, outlined the different issues voters experienced on Super Tuesday.\n\"From the time polls opened to when they closed, voters faced a series of obstacles: polling sites that opened hours late or not at all; broken voting machines and ballot-printers; crashed election websites; too many untrained poll workers; and voters\u2019 names missing from the registration rolls,\" she wrote.\n\"Then, especially later in the day, many voters in our major cities faced absurdly long wait times due to an inadequate number of polling locations, a lack of operational machines per location, and the failure to properly staff each location. As chronicled by numerous press reports, wait times lasted as long as seven hours at points, particularly in communities of color and on college campuses.\""}

Only 1,012 cases, or 4.1 percent, resulted in a criminal conviction.

But the data is from 1980, part of a paper that talks about drug dealing and legitimate self-employment.\nThe campaign also had fresher data in mind, however, including a USA Today analysis of arrest rates around the country\u00a0in the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo. In at least 1,581 of 3,538 police departments, the paper found, blacks were even more likely to be arrested than in Ferguson. Only 173 departments \"arrested black people at a rate equal to or lower than other racial groups,\" the paper reported.\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics periodically surveys the public to study police-citizen interactions. Its most recent report in 2008 found that white, black and Hispanic drivers were stopped at similar rates by police. However, black drivers were about three times as likely as white drivers to be searched during a traffic stop. (When a search occurred, evidence was found in only 8.4 percent of the cases, but the report doesn't break that down by race.)\nThe Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, has looked at that breakdown using 2013 profiling data posted in 2014 by Missouri's attorney general's office. It found that when a white driver was stopped in Ferguson, there was a 7 percent chance the car would be searched and a 34 percent chance that something would be found. But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher \u2014 12 percent \u2014 and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent).\nNot only that, blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop.\nIn a spot check, we found similar patterns in Jefferson City.\nIt's not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report, drug arrest rates have long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there's little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.\nWhat surveys have shown \"is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,\" said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.\"\nSentencing\nThere is also evidence for Clinton\u2019s statement that blacks are more likely to get a stiffer sentence than a white person who has been convicted of the same crime and has the same criminal history.\nStudies have shown, for instance, that when prosecutors are deciding on what charges to file against suspects, they tend to select more severe charges for blacks and to use habitual offender laws against blacks more than whites under similar circumstances, particularly when it comes to drug and property crimes, according to a Florida study reported in the journal Criminology.\nA 2013 study in the Yale Law Journal reported that black men were nearly twice as likely to be charged with an offense that carried a mandatory minimum sentence than white men facing similar circumstances. When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history.\nAfter controlling for the arrest offense, a person's criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found.\nThe problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity \"accumulates at each level,\" said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project.\n\"You're a little bit more likely to get arrested if you're a person of color than if you're white. You're a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That's going to make it harder for you to get released. You're a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,\" she said. \"As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it's going to be significant as you go through the stages.\"\nTonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but \"it depends hugely on what crime you're talking about.\n\"If it's a drug crime that's affected by mandatory minimums, it's vastly longer,\" Tonry said. \"If you're talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.\"\nHow much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there's a greater demand for police. That can skew the numbers.\nAnd sentences can be longer for poor people under pressure to cop a plea because they can't afford bail or a good lawyer."}

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., jabbed President Donald Trump for threatening two pillars of America\u2019s social safety net.\n\"Trump just promised that if he wins reelection, he\u2019ll gut Social Security and Medicare,\" Harris posted Aug. 9 on Instagram.\nHarris was talking about what Trump said when he unilaterally gave workers a four-month break on the payroll tax that helps fund Social Security.\nTrump\u2019s action, via an executive memorandum, said nothing about Medicare payroll taxes.\nThe meaning of Trump\u2019s words at the signing event were unclear, and spurred legitimate confusion. But Harris exaggerated what was known even then. And more is known now.\nTrump\u2019s murky words\nEach paycheck, employees see 6.2% of their wages go to Washington \u2014 a part of the payroll tax \u2014 to help fund Social Security. At an Aug. 8 event at Trump\u2019s Bedminster, N.J., golf resort, Trump signed a memorandum that ordered Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to defer those payments for four months, from September through the end of the year.\nThat means someone making the median weekly wage of about $1,000 could see an extra $62 in their paycheck. (We say \"could\" because the memo says employers don\u2019t need to send the money to Washington. It doesn\u2019t say they must give it to their workers.)\nDeferring taxes means they would be due at some point. At the event, Trump made two comments to reassure the people who saw a little extra money.\n\"If I\u2019m victorious on Nov. 3, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax,\" Trump said. \"So I\u2019m going to make them all permanent.\"\nA bit later, he said, \"If I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I\u2019ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax.\"\nThis triggered a debate over what Trump had in mind for the future.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow later said Trump was talking solely about letting workers keep the tax holiday money.\nBut the Biden-Harris campaign took away a different meaning.\nSpokesman Michael Gwin told us that when Trump said he would \"make permanent cuts to the payroll tax,\" that meant eliminating the employee side of the tax completely.\nThat was a possible interpretation, even if Trump lacked the power to make it happen.\nWhat Trump\u2019s plan means for Social Security\nTrump\u2019s temporary deferral on payroll taxes costs somewhere between $80 billion and $100 billion.\nTrump said he doesn\u2019t want workers to pay it back. His memo tells the Treasury secretary to \"explore avenues, including legislation, to eliminate the obligation to pay the taxes deferred.\"\nIf workers aren\u2019t on the hook, then there are two options.\nThe money either comes out of Social Security\u2019s trust funds, or general revenues.\nThe last trim on payroll taxes came as the country was climbing out of the Great Recession. The Obama administration and Congress dropped the tax by two percentage points in 2011-12. The total cost was $224 billion, and the law that made it happen said Congress would backfill the trust fund money from general revenues.\nThe Biden-Harris campaign told us that if Trump had that in mind, he could have said so, or included it in the memo.\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that the money would be made up with dollars from the general fund. The administration can\u2019t promise that on its own. Congress, which controls federal spending, would need to pass a bill to make it happen. (That could be the \"legislation\" mentioned in the memo.)\nIf Congress doesn\u2019t backfill the money, Social Security runs out of money a bit sooner.\nToday, the combined Social Security trust funds are projected to be depleted as of 2035.\nWilliam Hoagland with the Bipartisan Policy Center estimates the cost of the payroll tax deferral at $80 billion.\n\"A hit of $80 billion not replenished would not gut the program,\" Hoagland said. \"It would only impact the date of depletion, possibly a year or two earlier than expected.\"\nA final note about statements that came after Harris'\u00a0post: On Aug. 12,\u00a0Trump said that he hoped to forgive the deferred payroll tax payments, backfill those payments from the general fund,\u00a0and eliminate the payroll tax for Social Security going forward. He also promised to find another way to fund the program.\nThe next day, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said, \"What he was meaning yesterday is that he wants permanent forgiveness of the deferral.\""}

But his implication that a legal recreational cannabis market is responsible for the uptick in impaired driving and traffic deaths has not been proven.\nWhile the studies do not prove that legal recreational cannabis markets are the cause of impaired driving and traffic death increases in Colorado or Washington, it does serve as a \"solid indicator\" that cannabis can impact driver safety.\nWe rule Anderson\u2019s statement is Half True.","full_article":"Last month Tom Anderson, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety, said at a public hearing that the state should not move forward with a recreational market for cannabis until police have access to roadside saliva tests.\nAnderson said roadside testing for cannabis impairment is necessary because if Vermont legalizes a market for cannabis, it will see an increase in impaired driving and roadway deaths. The saliva tests would enable police to determine when drivers have the drug in their system.\u00a0\"If the experiences in Colorado and Washington are the experiences we have here, roadway deaths are going to go up, impaired driving is likely to go up,\" Anderson said.\nA number of readers told us Anderson was off the mark. So we decided to find out: Have legal recreational cannabis markets in Colorado and Washington led to a rise in roadway deaths and impaired driving rates?\nWe reached out to the Department of Public Safety and asked for sources backing up the commissioner's claim.\nIn response, the department sent seven sources -- including five studies and two news articles from the\u00a0Denver Post and the Bellingham Herald. The sources all show that rates of impaired driving and roadway fatalities have increased since cannabis was legalized.\nHowever, even that data is contradictory. None of the sources have proven the increase was caused by the legalization of recreational cannabis markets alone, which was the point that Anderson seemed to be making.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that no accurate roadside testing for cannabis impairment currently exists. At this point, law enforcement typically use blood tests to determine whether drivers have THC in their system. The drug, however, can remain in someone\u2019s blood for weeks, making it difficult to determine the time at which someone is actually under the influence.\nRecreational cannabis has been legal in Washington and Colorado since 2012. Recreational stores opened in 2014.\nA study by the Foundation for Traffic Safety reported in 2016 that an estimated 303 drivers \u2014 10 percent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes in Washington between 2010 and 2014 \u2014 had detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, in their blood at or shortly after the time of a crash.\nThe number of drivers who tested positive for THC remained steady before and immediately after legalization took effect, according to the study.\nBut researchers found that about nine months after cannabis was legally available for purchase, the number of drugged driving citations began increasing at a rate of almost 10 percentage points per year. It is unclear whether the increase was caused by the legalization of cannabis or by factors \"that were beyond the scope of the study.\"\nA study by the Colorado Department of Transportation published in August 2018 reported that overall, the number of fatalities involving drivers who tested positive for cannabis has nearly doubled since recreational legalization in 2014 -- from 75 that year to 125 in 2016 and 139 in 2017.\nHowever, in spite of cannabis-related driving fatalities going up, in the first quarter of 2017, the number of cannabis-related DUIs dropped by 33 percent from the same period in 2016, according to Colorado State Patrol. From January until March in 2017, 155 people received citations for cannabis impairment while driving, compared to 232 people in 2016.\nThe Colorado study does not point to legalization as the cause of the increase in cannabis impaired driving.\nAnother study last year, conducted by researchers at the University of Oregon, explicitly stated that the argument that legal cannabis has led to a spike in traffic deaths and impaired driving is misleading. The upward trend in cannabis-related fatalities in Colorado, and to some extent in Washington, would have taken place whether or not recreational cannabis was legalized, the authors say.\nSome research clearly supports the claim that traffic accidents are on the rise in states that have legalized cannabis, but the reason behind why it is happening remains unclear to researchers.\nA study released in October by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), estimated that the rate of car crashes rose a combined 6 percent following the start of retail sales of recreational cannabis in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington."}

He would almost certainly have been in line to receive it even if he had taken a different job, as long as it wasn\u2019t with an Exxon Mobil competitor.\nFor a statement that has an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.","full_article":"In moving from CEO of Exxon Mobil to Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is getting $180 million from his former company.\nBut is the payment a \"government service golden parachute\" that Tillerson would not get had he taken a different job?\nThat\u2019s the allegation from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has railed against people who cash in by moving from the private sector into government jobs.\nBaldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who faces re-election in 2018, made her attack on the Senate floor on Jan. 31, 2017, the day before Tillerson was sworn in as President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Baldwin referred to President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and a bill she said was aimed at \"slowing the revolving door\" in Washington, then said:\n\"I was inspired to introduce this legislation when I saw several Obama administration appointees receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for leaving their private-sector jobs to join the government. These \u2018government service golden parachutes,\u2019 as they are known, demonstrate how valuable some companies believe it is to have friends in high places.\"\nTillerson, she continued, \"received a $180 million payout from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere.\"\nWhat we found is that Baldwin is right on the figure. But the payment is a retirement benefit that Tillerson earned after more than 40 years with the company, not extra compensation conditioned on joining the government a few months before reaching the company\u2019s mandatory retirement age.\nIndeed, experts told us, he likely only risked losing the $180 million had he gone to work for an Exxon Mobil competitor.\nThe money -- yes\nThere was no government requirement, PolitiFact New York found, for Tillerson to divest from his Exxon Mobil stock. But had he kept the stock, he would have had to recuse himself of any State Department business related to the company, or take other steps to avoid a conflict of interest.\nAn agreement he made with Exxon Mobil -- the one that drew Baldwin\u2019s attack -- is aimed at avoiding the conflict of interest.\nThe Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian and other news organizations reported on an announcement of the agreement, as well as a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that Exxon Mobil made on Jan. 4, 2017. That was a few days after Tillerson\u2019s retirement and a week before his Senate confirmation hearing.\nTillerson had been set to receive roughly $180 million in Exxon Mobil shares that would have vested over a decade following his retirement, which was expected to be in March 2017, when he turns\u00a065.\nInstead, Exxon essentially \"cashed out\" Tillerson. Under the agreement, the shares were transferred to an independently managed trust, which will pay Tillerson the $180 million over the same 10-year schedule. The deal amounts to about $7 million less than the compensation package that he would have received if he had not been tapped for the post, the Wall Street Journal noted.\n\u2018Golden parachute\u2019 -- no\nNow let\u2019s turn to Baldwin\u2019s larger point -- that the payment is a \"government service golden parachute\" Tillerson would not get if \"had he taken a job elsewhere.\"\nBaldwin\u2019s office sent us information, but no one replied to our requests to speak to someone in the office. The office suggested we contact Jeff Hauser, who is executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C..\nHauser argued that Exxon Mobil gave \"special dispensation\" to Tillerson by cashing him out on the stock that otherwise would have taken 10 years to vest. He noted that the company\u2019s policy states that executives risk losing long-term equity awards by retiring early.\nBut the policy also allows for the company to decide that the executive can keep the awards, which is what it did in making the $180 million agreement.\nRosanna Landis Weaver, executive compensation project manager for Oakland, Calif.-based As You Sow, a national group that advocates for shareholders, also criticized Exxon Mobil for not sticking to its usual practice of long-term vesting. She told us she expects the cash payout to the trust, rather than receiving the stock over time, will benefit Tillerson financially, though she acknowledged that\u2019s an open question.\nBut Baldwin\u2019s statement isn\u2019t about the impact of Tillerson\u2019s deal on Exxon Mobil stockholders and the $180 million doesn\u2019t come as a result of Tillerson taking the secretary of state job.\n\"It doesn't appear to be a reward specifically for going into government service, but rather a standard agreement in which he gets the payout as long as he does not work in the (oil) industry for 10 years,\" said Ari Goldberg, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog.\nA \"golden parachute\" typically refers to severance payments executives get after their companies are acquired or made part of a merger. Indeed, the federal tax code refers to parachute payments as compensation paid as a result of a change in control of a company. But the payment Tillerson is getting isn\u2019t something extra. It\u2019s a retirement benefit he had earned.\n\"Tillerson is clearly getting a large cash settlement, but this reflects payments for services earned over the prior many years, and not a cash reward or \u2018parachute\u2019 tied to his resignation,\" said executive compensation expert Kevin Murphy, a finance and business economics professor at the University of Southern California.\nWe\u2019ll note that Baldwin used the lesser known term \"government service golden parachute.\" But that typically is used by groups such as the AFL-CIO union in reference to Wall Street. It refers to financial incentives Wall Street firms give to senior executives who take government jobs. The concern is whether the companies then expect favorable government treatment from their former executives.\nOthers refer to government-based golden parachutes provided by Wall Street banks as accelerated vesting of equity-based awards for senior executives who resign voluntarily to enter government service -- in other words, compensation that they would otherwise forfeit for failing to meet normal vesting requirements. That\u2019s more similar to Tillerson\u2019s situation.\nBut Murphy and another executive compensation expert Steven Balsam, told us it\u2019s highly unlikely that Tillerson would have lost out on his retirement benefits, a few months before reaching the mandatory retirement age, simply by taking another job -- unless it was with an Exxon Mobil competitor.\n\"This terms of his retirement\/separation were agreed upon prior to his being nominated to be secretary of state. He\u2019s not getting it because he took the (secretary of state) job,\" said Balsam, \u00a0a business professor at Temple University in Philadelphia."}

Millions are doomed, and I fear that many will die when they next come in contact with the coronavirus.\"\nColeman also goes on to reiterate that he believes the vaccines \"could kill more people than COVID-19,\" and that it \"now seems likely that the vaccines may be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions who haven\u2019t been vaccinated.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis is not the first time PolitiFact has debunked Coleman\u2019s conspiracy theories about the coronavirus vaccines.\nThe largely self-published British writer has denied the existence of HIV\/AIDS and in 2019 authored a book aimed at discrediting trust in vaccines.\nA qualified and practicing general practitioner in the 1970s, Coleman is no longer licensed to practice medicine. The UK\u2019s Advertising Standards Authority has also repeatedly taken issue with how Coleman\u2019s work is advertised and promoted.\nThe video\u2019s claim about the COVID-19 vaccines is rooted in what have come to be referred to as the \"Great Reset\" and \"Agenda 21\" conspiracy theories.\nEssentially, the \"Great Reset\" theory is that a group of \"global elites want to use the coronavirus as a tool to reorganize global societies and economies to their benefit at the expense of ordinary people, with the ultimate goal of a global totalitarian regime.\"\nRevived during the COVID-19 pandemic, the \"Agenda 21\" conspiracy theory dates back to a UN document from the early 90s and similarly holds that \"a secret plot to impose a totalitarian world government\" is in motion.\nThere is no evidence to support these widely debunked theories, which have also been linked with the QAnon conspiracy theory.\nThere is also no definitive evidence that deaths have been caused by COVID-19 vaccines. Various fact-checking outlets have reported that there is no clear evidence the coronavirus vaccinations have killed or will kill anyone \u2014 let alone kill millions.\nEven deaths that occur after someone has received a COVID-19 vaccine are not necessarily caused by the vaccine itself. Experts who work with the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, a national database that monitors vaccine safety by recording health issues that occur after vaccinations, say that isolated experiences \u2014 even deaths \u2014 do not establish causation.\nPaul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told PolitiFact that reports of deaths following COVID-19 vaccinations \"can never answer the question of whether a vaccine causes a particular outcome.\" Only a study with a control group can establish causation, he said.\nThe COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. have been proven to be safe and effective in tens of thousands of people who participated in clinical trials."}

You can\u2019t have incentives to be healthier.\"\nRyan is largely on point if the \"you\" refers only to insurance companies, but there\u2019s nothing in the context to justify such a narrow interpretation. The claim was broad and implied a ban on incentives. That\u2019s not the case.\nWellness programs, while not available to everyone, are specifically authorized by the Affordable Care Act as a means for employers to raise or lower premiums by up to 30 percent based on employees\u2019 health-related behavior.\nFor a statement that is partly accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context,our rating is Half True.","full_article":"The health care overhaul known as \"Obamacare\" is as complex as it is far-reaching, so it\u2019s hardly a surprise that arguments over what the law requires or prohibits are lingering years after it took effect.\nU.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan drifted into those murky waters in an April 27, 2016, town hall meeting, asserting healthy people can\u2019t be rewarded for their lifestyle under President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark legislation.\nRyan framed his criticism around a comparison to a hypothetical neighbor.\n\"I\u2019m 46, I stay in shape, I don\u2019t smoke, I have a couple Miller Lites now and then, but I stay healthy, I work on it,\" Ryan said during the meeting at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. \"My next-door neighbor could be (the) same demographic, same age, he could drink a case of beer each night, two steaks, you know, not run, be 100 pounds overweight.\"\nThen the claim about Obamacare: \"Under the law, you can\u2019t reward a person for better behavior. You can\u2019t have incentives to be healthier. That makes no sense.\"\nDoes Obamacare (officially the Affordable Care Act), really prohibit incentives that would charge less to healthier people?\n\"Like Bill Clinton would say, it depends on what \u2018you\u2019 means,\" said Soeren Mattke, managing director of Health Advisory Services for the nonpartisan Rand Corp. think tank.\nA tale of two interpretations\nIndeed, insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act cannot require different rates based on a person\u2019s health and lifestyle. The HealthCare.gov website even expressly states companies \"can\u2019t take your current health or medical history into account\" when setting premiums.\nThe one caveat lies in the definition of health history.\nThe ACA allows five factors to be considered in setting premiums: location, age, plan category, whether dependents are covered and tobacco use. Tobacco use could fall into the health \"behavior\" category Ryan referenced, though smoking wasn\u2019t among the unhealthy vices he laid out for the hypothetical neighbor.\nBut Ryan\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t specify insurance companies. And if the \"you\" is interpreted as referring also to employers \u2014 that\u2019s how many of the experts we consulted read it \u2014 the claim gets dicier.\n\"The Affordable Care Act allows employers to vary premiums by up to 30 percent to be able to reward employees not only for participating in wellness programs but to achieve specific metrics of health,\" said Meena Seshamani, director of the Office of Health Reform at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe law even increased the maximum reward for involvement in a wellness program from 20 percent to 30 percent of the premium, also boosting the max to 50 percent for those in a smoking cessation program.\nSome 49 percent of Americans are insured through their employer, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. But not all employers have such programs, and then only a portion tie in financial incentives.\nKaiser\u2019s 2014 employer survey found 74 percent of firms offering health insurance have some kind of wellness program. Among those with programs, 36 percent of large firms and 18 percent of small firms offer financial incentives for participation.\nRyan\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries seeking clarity on who he was referencing or evidence to support his statement.\nWellness programs in dispute\nDespite the Affordable Care Act language, wellness programs remain a gray area of health care law \u2014 and a moving target.\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued some companies over wellness programs they believed went too far with incentives or disincentives. Wellness programs are typically a combination of screening activities (questionnaires and\/or clinical tests) and interventions to specifically address risks such as weight, smoking, fitness and drug use.\nOne such case stemmed from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, where the EEOC alleged Flambeau, Inc., a plastics manufacturer based in Baraboo, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by requiring employees to participate in a wellness program in order to get company health insurance. Judge Barbara Crabb dismissed the case in December 2015, however, agreeing with the company that the program fell under an exception allowing for activities related to administering an insurance plan.\nThe EEOC is appealing the ruling, even as it issued a new rule in mid-May attempting to clarify how wellness programs can comply with the ACA, the disabilities act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nThis and similar EEOC lawsuits elsewhere are making employers hesitant to implement wellness plans that require certain benchmarks, said Tom Miller, resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank.\n\"It\u2019s one thing to participate and be rewarded for it, it\u2019s another set of hurdles if you start requiring people to succeed at achieving certain goals,\" Miller said. \"It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it, but there\u2019s a lot of smoke in the air that discourages employers from going that far as a general rule.\""}

And comments at a public hearing influenced that process, leading to a decision by the director of health to delay execution of the policy for one year.\nMore recently, the new health director told the public that philosophical objections were enough to qualify for the religious exemption. In other words, parents can pretty much say whatever they want to get exemptions for their children.\nFor those reasons, we rate the statementHalf True.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at[email protected]And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)","full_article":"Rhode Island has issued a controversial vaccination requirement designed to fight HPV, or human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted virus that can cause cancer.\nThe requirement, ordered by the Rhode Island Department of Health, took effect Aug. 1. It has drawn fire from a group of critics that included the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, which calls itself a \"free enterprise think tank.\"\nThe new policy calls for the vaccination of \u00a0all \u00a0seventh grade boys and girls before the start of school. The requirement does not apply to students whose doctors cite a medical problem; or to students whose parents object for religious reasons. And the health department defines religious reasons very liberally.\nBefore a series of public information meetings on the vaccination requirement, the Center for Freedom and Prosperity posted this statement on its website:\n\"Rhode Island will become just the second state to mandate the vaccine \u2026 and the only state to do so by regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people.\"\nWe telephoned Mike Stenhouse, the center\u2019s founder and chief executive officer, and asked him for his sources. We didn\u2019t get anything from him right away.\nSo we did our own research and found that Virginia is the only other state to require students to receive immunization for HPV. Virginia\u2019s vaccination requirement, which is only for sixth-grade girls, took effect in 2008 following an act of the legislature.\nRhode Island\u2019s policy is the product of a regulatory process that began in 2013 under the leadership of Michael Fine, then the state\u2019s director of the Department of Health.\nIn both states, HPV vaccination policies use the word \"required\" and both have opt-out provisions. In Virginia, \u00a0parents have \"sole discretion\" on whether their children receive the vaccination.\nStenhouse labels the policies in Virginia and Rhode Island as mandates. But Jason L. Schwartz, an assistant professor at the Yale University School of Public Health, says you can\u2019t call policies with such liberal exemptions mandates.\nThe breadth of Rhode Island\u2019s opt-out provisions may not have been clear to the \u00a0public \u2014 or to Stenhouse \u2014 before a public meeting Aug. 5. That\u2019s when Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, the new director of the Department of Health, told parents that their philosophical objections would qualify for the religious exemption spelled out in the regulations.\nBut what about the center\u2019s claim that Rhode Island imposed the requirement by \"regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people\"?\nAnd, as the center says later in its policy statement, was the health department\u2019s decision an example of \"regulatory despotism\" that \"bypasses the traditional democratic process\"?\nWhile it\u2019s true that the General Assembly did not pass a law for the HPV vaccination, existing Rhode Island law gives the health director the power to adopt regulations to protect public health. And, of course, the health director is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the governor.\nFurther, control of health-care policy by the executive branch is common in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, makes decisions affecting the health welfare of the country without first getting an act of Congress.\n\"To say it\u2019s anti-democratic would be a misunderstanding of how we structure our government in the United States,\" says Schwartz, the Yale professor, who co-authored a recent article about state vaccination requirements for the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nAlso it\u2019s not as if the state adopted the regulation in a back room somewhere \u2014 even though Stenhouse\u2019s organization on July 30 described the news of the requirement as a \"stunning revelation.\"\nOn Dec. 2, 2013, Fine, the former health director, filed a notice of public hearing for Jan. 16, 2014, and also solicited written statements on the issue. In response to criticism, the department delayed the beginning of the program from Aug. 1, 2014, to Aug. 1, 2015, according to a form for the regulation that was filed with the Office of Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea.\nThe Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union registered its ardent opposition to the proposed regulation at the hearing and in written comments. On Jan. 27, 2014, the ACLU called on the health department to reconsider the proposal. The ACLU also criticized the requirement on Facebook.\nThat\u2019s seems like debate to us.\nWe tried to get Stenhouse to explain what the center meant by the phrase \"regulatory fiat.\" He declined. Instead, he sent us a written statement in which he said the center \"stands by its statement\" and he challenged PolitiFact\u2019s fairness and objectivity."}

But Obama and experts have said some of the differences that have surfaced, if unresolved, could kill the final deal.\nWe rate Rubio\u2019s claim True.\nNote: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.","full_article":"How can the United States and Iran come to a deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program when the two countries can\u2019t even agree on what they supposedly agreed to?\nThat\u2019s the point presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. -- a vocal critic of the negotiations -- made on National Public Radio April 13.\n\"I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal's even viable,\" he said. \"The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things.\"\nPresident Barack Obama and the other negotiating parties -- Iran, China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany -- hit a milestone in early April. They established a framework agreement that lays the foundations for a final deal, to be reached in the summer. So we wondered: Are the United States and Iran\u2019s descriptions of what the deal will entail so different?\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, was a framework, not a final deal. The framework itself isn\u2019t publicly available, and the parties still have plenty of details to hammer out. For these reasons, there\u2019s room for the negotiating parties to fill in the blanks with details that appeal to constituents.\nEven so, some of the differences between the United States\u2019 and Iran\u2019s descriptions of the agreement are significant -- such as the timeline for sanctions relief and how much access international inspectors will have to Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\nBack in April, Iran and the United States decided to set these differences aside, hoping to successfully address them later, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in nuclear weapons policy.\n\"These differences are important, however, and could very well kill the deal,\" Kroenig said.\nOfficials in both countries have said the other\u2019s descriptions run counter to what was decided in Lausanne, and if they can\u2019t agree, the potential for a deal might die.\nIranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Javad Zarif tweeted and said on Iranian television that the American factsheet was \"in contradiction\" to the framework agreement, according to the New York Times.\nResponding to a question about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s pushback against the deal, Obama told reporters April 11, \"If that is his understanding and his position -- in ways that can't be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isn't cheating under any program, and that we don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation -- then we're probably not going to get a deal.\"\nSignificant discrepancies\nWe reached out to Rubio\u2019s team and didn\u2019t hear back. But Iran and the United States have each produced factsheets about the agreement, in addition to a joint statement from the negotiating parties. If you want to look at the details yourself, Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs put together a side-by-side comparison of all three fact sheets and relevant political statements.\nA major discrepancy between Iran and the United States is the timeline and conditions for pulling back sanctions against Iran.\nAccording to the American factsheet, the United States and European Union will \"suspend\" sanctions against Iran after it has been verified that Iran is complying with the deal. The sanctions can \"snap back\" into place if it is discovered that Iran is not complying.\nIran\u2019s summary, on the other hand, says the sanctions will be \"revoked\" as soon as the deal is implemented -- distinguishing a permanent change from the ability to reinstate sanctions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said April 4, \"During the talks we (both sides) always talked about lifting economic, financial, and banking sanctions. We never talked about the suspension of the sanctions, and if that were the case, no agreement would form.\"\nAdditionally, Obama said the sanctions relief would be \"phased in,\" while Rouhani said the sanctions would be canceled on the \"very first day of the implementation of the deal.\"\nAnother point of contention is the level of access international inspectors will have to Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\nThe American factsheet has several bullet points emphasizing that the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s inspectors will have near\u00a0universal access to Iranian nuclear facilities. Obama called it \"unprecedented,\" noting that Iran will also be required to grant access to the material supply chain in addition to the facilities themselves.\nIran\u2019s summary of the framework says much less about verification processes. It says Iran will comply with some of the agency\u2019s protocols \"on a voluntary and temporary basis.\" Additionally, Iran\u2019s religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said international inspectors will not have unlimited access to nuclear facilities.\n\"It must absolutely not be allowed for them to infiltrate into the country\u2019s defense and security domain under the pretext of inspections,\" Khamenei said, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal.\nWhile the discrepancies over sanctions and levels of verification are important, others are a just matter of spin, said Graham Allison, director of Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center and a nuclear weapons analyst.\nFor example, regarding one of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facilities, the United States factsheet says, \"Almost two-thirds of Fordow\u2019s centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed.\" Iran\u2019s factsheet, on the other hand says, \"More than 1,000 centrifuge machines and all related infrastructure in Fordow will be preserved and maintained.\"\nBoth descriptions are accurate -- Fordow currently has 2,710 centrifuges, and the deal will lower that number to 1,044.\nWhile the differences in the public descriptions may be striking, Allison said people should not pass judgment on the final deal yet, given that the real negotiations are conducted in private, meaning the real contents of the deal are private, too.\n\"Poisonous political divides in both Washington and Tehran mean that a host of commentators and even journalists seize on, and even exaggerate, these differences for their own political ends,\" Allison said."}

News political reporter Chris Moody, who was there, tweeted it out.)\nThe economics\nPaul\u2019s comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted just over two weeks from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16.\nDuring those two weeks, up to 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, national parks shut their doors, government-funded scientific research halted, and various health and safety inspections -- out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration -- \u00a0were put on hold.\nSo how does not spending money come at a cost?\n\"Sen. Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called 'shutdown,'\" a spokesman told us. \"Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn't work and government had to pay interest on late payments.\"\nWe found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums.\nBut a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity.\nThe most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from the Office of Management and Budget, which reports directly to the president. (Paul\u2019s spokesman pointed us to this New York Times article about the White House report as evidence.)\nHere\u2019s a few highlights:\n$2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending);\n\n\n120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October;\n\n\n$500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ;\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook posts\n\n\nstated on October 6, 2022 in a video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jan. 6 hearing \u201cwas abruptly canceled after it was revealed that news networks would not be showing it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Gabrielle Settles \u2022 October 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue;\n\n\nInterest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown;\n\n\nResources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode;\n\n\n1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn\u2019t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities;\n\n\nStalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market.\nWe also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy\u2019s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compiled the reports in 2013.)\nMark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown\u2019s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned.\nStandard and Poor's said the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent. (In December, the comic strip Doonesbury referenced this report, and we rated it Mostly True.)\nMacroeconomic Advisers (in a report for the Peterson Foundation) estimated the shutdown cut 0.3 points off of fourth-quarter growth, \"mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees.\"\nThe Macroeconomic Advisers report said private-sector effects were limited, especially because the furloughed workers received back pay.\nBloomberg News surveyed 71 economists and found the median GDP growth projection immediately after the shutdown was 0.4 points lower than a survey conducted a month earlier.\nThe counterargument\nIn consulting experts and scouring shutdown coverage, we found no economic modeling or analysis that showed the economy staying neutral or experiencing positive growth as a result of the shutdown.\nSome libertarians argue -- such as economist Jeff Dorfman for Forbes -- that just because the government didn\u2019t spend money for two weeks doesn\u2019t mean that the same amount of money didn\u2019t get spent elsewhere in the private sector, though he did not provide data or other proof that this was happening.\nDan Mitchell of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, made a similar argument, but offered a caveat -- that when government spending is suddenly reduced, the economy doesn\u2019t instantaneously recalibrate itself, so there can be economic \"bumps\" in the immediate aftermath -- such as what was seen in the shutdown."}

Although analysts say more manpower could help the agency narrow the gap, it wouldn\u2019t come close to filling it. Some unpaid taxes are extremely difficult to sniff out, and some people simply can\u2019t pay, they said.\nSo on the whole, we rate Connolly\u2019s statement Half True.\nEditor's note: A previous version of this story had the wrong figure for the amount of cuts to the IRS budget in the last five years.","full_article":"U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents legions on federal workers living in Northern Virginia, scoffs at conservative efforts to pare the Internal Revenue Service.\nCongress has cut about $1.2\u00a0billion from the IRS budget during the past five years. The actions impair the nation\u2019s ability to collect revenue needed to reduce deficits, Connolly, D-11th, said during a Sept. 9 interview on Federal News Radio.\n\"It\u2019s estimated we leave somewhere north of $350 billion a year - that\u2019s billion - a year on the table uncollected, because IRS doesn\u2019t have the resources,\" he said.\nConnolly added that if the IRS had more resources, it could collect so much in unpaid taxes that the government could get rid of the so-called sequestration budget cuts - projected to slice about $1 trillion during the next decade - and have enough left over to make a sizable down payment on the national debt.\nWe examined Connolly\u2019s claim that the U.S. loses about $350 billion in tax revenue each year because the IRS lacks the means to collect it.\nGeorge Burke, the congressman\u2019s spokesman, said Connolly\u2019s statement was based on IRS reports on the country\u2019s \"tax gap\" - the amount of underreported income, unpaid tax bills and taxes that never were collected because returns weren\u2019t filed.\n\"On several occasions, IRS officials have testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the amount of uncollected taxes and the agency's lack of resources,\" Burke wrote in an email. \"The potential return on investment is mind-boggling.\"\nThe $350 billion\nThe IRS periodically provides an estimate of how much revenue Uncle Sam is owed but doesn\u2019t collect because of tax evasion. Mark Hanson, an IRS spokesman, told us in an email that it takes years for the agency to compile its tax-gap estimate, because it requires complicated research.\nThe latest figures available are for 2006. The IRS says there were nearly $2.7 trillion in total tax liabilities in 2006. Of that amount, about $450 billion wasn\u2019t paid on time. The main cause of \u00a0missed payments was taxpayers underreporting their income, the IRS said.\nSome late payments eventually trickled in, and the IRS took enforcement actions against some tax scofflaws. Those actions recovered about $65 billion, according to the agency\u2019s tallies, leaving about $385 billion in liabilities the IRS says it was owed but didn\u2019t collect.\nSo Connolly\u2019s claim that there\u2019s \"somewhere north\" of $350 billion in taxes left on the table has validity.\nIs all that tax collectible?\nTo complete our fact check, we also need to look at the second part of Connolly\u2019s statement - that the IRS doesn\u2019t collect the $350 billion-plus each year because it lacks \"resources.\"\nTwo analysts told us that extra resources could help the IRS narrow the gap, but it wouldn\u2019t completely erase tax evasion.\n\"Some of it is uncollectible, people don\u2019t have the money,\" said Eric Toder, co-director of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center who has written about the tax gap.\nMoreover, Toder said that certain unpaid tax liabilities are just inherently difficult to discover, such as cash transactions by small businesses that can occur without any record. More auditors would capture some unpaid taxes, Toder said, but they would provide only a few stitches in mending the tax gap.\nIn 2007, Toder authored a paper that said Congress and President George W. Bush\u2019s administration could take added steps to patch the tax gap, such as providing the IRS more resources for enforcement and requiring taxpayers to report more income information. But he said policymakers had to be realistic about the return they would see on such initiatives.\n\"Although estimates of how much additional resources and better enforcement tools would raise are incomplete and highly uncertain, it is extremely unlikely that they could raise more than $20-30 billion per year,\" Toder wrote.\nIn an interview, Toder told us there is a danger the tax gap could grow if the IRS is cut back too much and there becomes a sense that enforcement is lax due to strained resources.\nWe also spoke to Robert Goulder, tax policy counsel at Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based non-profit that examines tax regulations. He told us filling the gap would require unrealistic scenarios, such as an IRS agent being assigned to watch the cash register at every \"mom and pop\" small business. Added enforcement also would run counter to an American culture that chafes at inquiries from the IRS, Goulder said.\nEven with an unlimited budget, Goulder said, \"they still couldn\u2019t get the tax gap down to zero.\"\nA 2012 Government Accountability Office report, which looked at various strategies to cut down the tax gap, said \"closing the entire gap may not be feasible, since it could entail more intrusive recordkeeping or reporting than the public is willing to accept or more resources than the IRS is able to commit.\" It cited a 1997 GAO report which said \"it would be unrealistic to assume that our tax system, or any tax system, can achieve 100-percent compliance and thus eliminate the tax gap.\""}

But it overreaches by assuming that Joe Biden acted to protect the company his son was affiliated with. In reality, there was widespread agreement in the West that the existing prosecutor had to go, and it\u2019s not clear that the company would have benefited from his ouster anyway, given evidence that its cases had long been dormant.\nThat said, experts criticize the Bidens for their arrangement, saying it could have been a significant conflict of interest.\nWe rate the statement Half True.\nCORRECTION, May 8, 2019: This version clarifies that Hunter Biden and Devon Archer were the two partners who \"pursued business with international entities.\" Christopher Heinz was not a part of those pursuits","full_article":"Editor's Note, Sept. 23, 2019:\u00a0This story was first published May 9, 2019; we have since published additional coverage\u00a0that incorporates new developments here.\nShady self-dealing in the Ukraine? It\u2019s not just the Republican side that does that, says a social media meme that makes the charge against Democrat Joe Biden.\nThe episode involved his son Hunter Biden\u2019s work on behalf of a Ukrainian energy company at a time when the elder Biden was vice president and a key figure in U.S. policy on Ukraine. The story has been public for years, but it received new attention with Biden running strong among 2020 Democratic presidential contenders.\nOne viral image being shared on social media used a bit of reverse psychology, asking what Americans would think if the details of this story involved the Trump family rather than the Biden family. (Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chair Paul Manafort was convicted of tax and bank fraud for laundering millions in income he earned working for Ukrainian politicians.)\nHere\u2019s the text, which is accompanied by a photograph of Hunter Biden embracing his father.\n\"Did you know that Donald Trump Jr. was named a director to Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas producer following a Ukrainian visit by President Trump? Trump later threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn\u2019t fire a prosecutor looking into Don Jr.\u2019s company. Just kidding! That was Joe Biden when he was VP, and his son Hunter Biden.\"\nIs it true, as the image suggests, that Hunter Biden was serving as \"a director to Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas producer\" when the elder Biden \"threatened to withhold $1 BILLION in U.S. aid to Ukraine if they didn\u2019t fire a prosecutor looking into\" the gas company?\nKey takeaways\n\u2022 Hunter Biden did hold a directorship for a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president.\u00a0Experts agree that Hunter Biden's acceptance of the position\u00a0created a\u00a0conflict of interest for his father.\n\u2022 Vice President Joe Biden did\u00a0urge\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0to fire its top prosecutor, with the threat of withholding U.S. aid.\u00a0But that was the position of the wider U.S. government, as well as other international institutions.\n\u2022 We found no evidence to support the idea\u00a0that Joe Biden advocated with his son's interests in mind, as the message suggests. It's not even clear that the company was actively under investigation or that a\u00a0change in prosecutors\u00a0benefited it.\nWhat was Hunter Biden\u2019s role?\nHunter Biden did\u00a0hold a directorship with a natural gas company called Burisma Holdings,\u00a0beginning in the spring of 2014.\nReuters reported at the time that a statement on the company\u2019s website said the younger Biden \"would help the company with \"transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion,\" and other issues. The company also retained the law firm where Biden had been working, Boies Schiller Flexner.\nThe position with Burisma came at a time when the younger Biden had joined with Christopher Heinz (the stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.) and Devon Archer (a Kerry family friend) in a string of investment and consulting firms. Firms run by Biden and Archer \"pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,\" the New York Times reported.\nBiden\u2019s Burisma directorship attracted attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor F. Yanukovych who subsequently went into exile after a popular revolution. After Yanukovych was ousted, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving his business.\nIn 2015, Ukraine\u2019s newly appointed prosecutor general Viktor Shokin inherited some of the investigations into Zlochevsky and his company. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.) Shokin was ousted as prosecutor in 2016. Shokin is the prosecutor the viral post is talking about\u00a0(more on that later).\nDid Joe Biden know about his son\u2019s Ukrainian ties?\nThe Biden campaign told PolitiFact that the vice president learned about his son's role on the board through media reports and never discussed anything related to this company with his son.\nIn a White House press briefing on May 13, 2014, spokesman Jay Carney was asked about it, and whether it presented the appearance of a conflict of interest.\nCarney said, \"I would refer you to the Vice President\u2019s office. I saw those reports. Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the Vice President or President. But I would refer you to the Vice President\u2019s office.\"\nA year and a half later, the New York Times published an article that suggested that \"the credibility of the vice president\u2019s anti-corruption message may have been undermined\" by Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings with the company.\nIn that 2015 article, Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the vice president, played down any impact on the elder Biden\u2019s policies.\n\"Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer,\" she said. \"The vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company. The vice president has pushed aggressively for years, both publicly with groups like the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum and privately in meetings with Ukrainian leaders, for Ukraine to make every effort to investigate and prosecute corruption in accordance with the rule of law. It will once again be a key focus during his trip this week.\"\nHunter Biden told the New York Times this month in a statement that \"at no time have I discussed with my father the company\u2019s business, or my board service, including my initial decision to join the board.\"\nDid Biden make a threat to Ukraine?\nThe post said Biden\u00a0threatened to withhold $1 billion\u00a0unless the prosecutor -- Shokin -- was fired.\u00a0Biden didn\u2019t just make a threat to withhold aid unless Shokin was sacked -- it succeeded.\nBiden proudly recounted the moment during an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018. Here\u2019s the relevant portion of Biden\u2019s remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience:\n\"I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\u2019t. ...\n\"They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\nShokin\u2019s ouster came in March 2016, when he was stripped of his position by a wide margin in the legislature.\nWhy would Biden have pressured Ukraine over firing the prosecutor?\nThere\u2019s a strong case that Hunter Biden\u2019s position with the company had nothing to do with Biden\u2019s position on Shokin\u2019s ouster. That\u2019s because Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin\u2019s removal, arguing that he was not pursuing corruption cases aggressively.\nFor instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that \"it\u2019s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue\" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate.\nSteven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.\"\nAnders \u00c5slund, a resident senior fellow at Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread\nShokin \"failed to prosecute anybody of significance, protecting both the Yanukovych circle and the Poroshenko group,\" \u00c5slund said.\nDaria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, tweeted earlier this month that Shokin\u2019s firing was not about protecting the company Hunter Biden was working for. The firing \"was obviously not because the prosecutor wanted to investigate Burisma & Zlochevsky,\" she wrote.\nMeanwhile, accounts differ on whether Shokin was poised to prosecute Burisma at the time he was removed.\nIn an interview with the Ukrainian website Strana.ua this month, Shokin said the cases were indeed active.\nHowever, Vitaliy Kasko, who had been Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation before resigning in February 2016 citing corruption in the office, produced documents to Bloomberg that under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma had been dormant.\n\"There was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,\" Kasko told Bloomberg. \"It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\"\nEven if Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma had no impact on his father\u2019s policies, were his ties still problematic?\nWe found wide agreement among Ukraine policy experts that Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to become a director for Burisma presented a serious conflict of interest.\n\"It\u2019s not a crime, but it is a lapse. It\u2019s troubling,\" said Lincoln A. Mitchell, an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies who has written about governance in the former Soviet Union.\nPifer, who expressed reservations about the arrangement to the New York Times in 2015, said subsequent developments have only confirmed those concerns.\n\"It was a mistake for Hunter Biden to join the Burisma board, particularly given that the vice president was the senior U.S. official engaging Ukraine,\" Pifer said. \"Hunter Biden should have been more mindful of his father's position.\"\nAnd Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin professor who previously headed the university\u2019s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia, said Hunter Biden\u2019s hiring echoes the strategy common within Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, in which powerful interests try to secure influence on foreign policy by leveraging family members and associates of key leaders.\n\"Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,\" Herrera said. \"Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.\""}

Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they\u2019ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California).\"\nWith claims about border crossings boomeranging from Sacramento to Washington D.C., we decided to scrutinize the governor\u2019s statement in a fact check.\nIn this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas.\u00a0(AP Photo\/Eric Gay)\nOur research\nTo support it, the governor\u2019s spokesman cited U.S. Border Patrol figures for apprehensions across California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The data is from 1960 through 2017.\nFor 2017, they show 303,916 arrests across the entire Southern border. The previous low was 263,991 in 1971, 46 years ago.\nSo, Brown\u2019s claim that apprehensions in 2017 were \"as low as they\u2019ve been in nearly 50 years\" is on the mark.\nHe\u2019s also right that 85 percent of these took place \"outside California.\" About 68 percent of the arrests took place in Texas and New Mexico, while Arizona accounted for 17 percent and California about 15 percent, according to a review of the border patrol figures.\n\"He is absolutely correct,\" said Ev Meade, director of the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego. \"Even as we\u2019re at an historic low borderwide, it\u2019s particularly low in California. We\u2019re not receiving large numbers of migrants. Those migrants who are coming are largely crossing the Rio Grande and are apprehended at border patrol stations in Texas.\"\nMeade said the overall trend on the Southern border shows a dramatic decrease in apprehensions.\n\"In the year 2000, the border patrol apprehended 1.6 million people (borderwide). For 2017, it was down to 300,000. It\u2019s a tiny fraction,\" he said.\nJust along California\u2019s border, nearly 390,000 people were arrested in 2000. By 2017, that number had dropped to less than 45,000, border patrol figures show.\nSOURCE: Trans Border Institute, University of San Diego\nWave of migrants?\nWhile the governor\u2019s numbers are right, do they prove the first part of his claim: \"There is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California?\"\nGiven the context of the letter, Brown is clearly referring to migrants crossing into the state across the border with Mexico.\nBut what about the other ways people enter the state?\nJoseph Hayes, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California, pointed out that border arrests aren\u2019t necessarily the best metric to evaluate migration to California.\nMuch of the nation\u2019s and state\u2019s undocumented population results from individuals overstaying visas. In a 2017 report, the Center For Migration Studies found that two-thirds of those who arrived in the United States in 2014 and later would be counted as undocumented were admitted on temporary visas \"and then overstayed their period of admission or otherwise violated the terms of their visas.\"\nStill, Hayes said, the overall number of people living illegally in California has declined since before the Great Recession. The state was home to approximately 3 million undocumented residents in 2007, a figure that\u2019s dropped to as low as 2.35 million, according to estimates reviewed by PPIC.\nThe decline in the state\u2019s undocumented population reinforces Brown\u2019s contention there\u2019s \"no massive wave of migrants pouring into California.\"\nHistorically, Meade added, thousands of seasonal migrant farmworkers have come to California through the border with Mexico. He said that seasonal migration has largely \"dried up\" in recent years and many undocumented farmworkers now stay in the state year-round, rather than crossing back into Mexico.\n\"International migration has become more difficult,\" he said, citing greater border enforcement.\n2018 spike in crossings\nBrown cited figures from 2017. But what about the 200 percent spike in apprehensions borderwide in March 2018 compared with the same month a year ago, as cited this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen?\nMeade, of the Trans Border Institute, said the 2018 increase should be considered in context. It follows the historically low number of 2017 arrests, which has been attributed, in part, to fewer people trying to illegally cross the border due to Trump\u2019s election and hard-line immigration stance.\nImmigration experts have also cited the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive deportation efforts and greater economic opportunities in Mexico for recent declines in border crossings.\nMeade also noted the 2018 increase took place during spring, the high-point of migration season.\nHe said it doesn\u2019t represent a long-term trend. Nor does it show California is experiencing a disproportionate share of the 2018 increase, he said.\n\"Unless this were to continue for months and months and months and break the seasonal pattern, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real way to claim (the early part of 2018) is a crisis.\""}

The process of putting that report together didn\u2019t start until months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to restrict the investigation to those three agencies.\nHere\u2019s what Clapper said, according toCongressional Quarterly. (\"ICA\" refers to the January 2017 \"intelligence community assessment.\")\n\"Additionally, I'll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. And of course my direct official knowledge of any of this stopped on 20 January when my term of office was happily over.\n\"As you know, the (ICA) was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term.\"\nThe January report presented its findings by saying \"we assess,\" with \"we\" meaning \"an assessment by all three agencies.\"\nThe October statement, on the other hand, said \"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident\" in its assessment. As we noted in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not independently come to this conclusion, but as the head of the intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on behalf of the group.\nWe stand by our rating.","full_article":"Editor's note: We've attached an update to this fact-check below in response to reader queries after subsequent testimony by James Clapper. The original fact-check and rating remain unchanged.\nIn one of the most heated moments of the final presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over Russia\u2019s interference in the current election.\nSpeaking of the WikiLeaks\u2019 release of tens of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign and, earlier, the Democratic National Committee, Trump said Clinton had no idea who hacked and released the emails \u2014 \"Russia, China or anybody else.\"\nClinton responded by asking Trump if he really doesn\u2019t believe the 17 federal intelligence agencies that have said Russia is behind the cyberattack.\n\"We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,\" Clinton said. \"I find that deeply disturbing.\"\nBack in July, when WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, the government hadn\u2019t yet named a culprit.\nOn Oct. 7, however \u2014 the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta \u2014 the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, \"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.\"\nThe statement added that the recent hacks \"are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.\"\nThe statement also said the intelligence community believes these attacks are directed from top levels of the Russian government, as Clinton said.\n\"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\" the statement said.\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies, forming the basis of Clinton\u2019s claim.\nThe 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nThe 17 separate agencies did not independently declare Russia the perpetrator behind the hacks. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said that this cuts against Clinton\u2019s point, saying, \"It is unlikely that all 16 of the agencies had looked independently at the Russian connection, which is what Clinton seemed to indicate.\" (Cheung said 16 agencies because he omitted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence from his count.)\nHowever, as the head of the 17-agency intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, headed by James Clapper, speaks on behalf of the group."}

Using the data from Lugar Center\u2019s Bipartisan Index, which rates senators on their support of legislation across party lines, the authors found that Democratic women and men are \"statistically indistinguishable\" from one another, as are their Republican colleagues.\n\"To be sure, women\u2019s presence in Congress promotes democratic legitimacy, but it does little to reduce gridlock and stalemate on Capitol Hill,\" according to their Journal of Politics article in October.\nMore bills and co-sponsors\nAnother study, however, found that women senators gained more bipartisan co-sponsors for their bills and passed more bills over a seven-year period.

Wittmer wrote in the American Journal of Political Science that women in the minority party in the House of Representatives \u00a0\"continue to strive to build coalitions and bring about new policies,\" unlike men in the minority party. The authors, however, also found that \"majority party women have become less effective as Congress has become more polarized.\"\nThe same authors wrote in 2010, that \"our main findings suggest that high effort, consensus building, and issue specialization help female lawmakers achieve increased legislative effectiveness, but only under certain circumstances.\"\nGillibrand\u2019s office also cited an analysis in Vox, which highlighted several studies of women\u2019s increased productivity as legislators relative to men.\nOne oft-cited study, \"The Jackie (and Jill) Robinson Effect: Why Do Congresswomen Outperform Congressmen?\" found women secured more discretionary spending for their districts and sponsored and co-sponsored more bills than men.\nYet another study, published in 2016, found that in the House between 1990 and 2010, Republican women had more success securing bipartisan sponsors for bills than men, while Democratic women secured fewer bipartisan sponsors for their bills than men.\n\"We interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest, rather than gender per se,\" wrote Stefano Gagliarducci and M.

But five virologists, most of whom work in COVID-19 testing labs, told us that the gist of it was to remind lab technicians to carefully read the user manuals that come with PCR tests, the most widely used diagnostic tests for the coronavirus.\n\"This is not new information. This is essentially a reminder from the WHO to testing laboratories,\" said Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator with the McGill University Office for Science and Society. \"This notice is not an admission that the PCR test for COVID-19 does not work or is wildly inaccurate.\"\nHow the tests work\nCoronavirus tests are performed on samples of cells taken with a swab from the back of the throat. The lab isolates the genetic material from those cells and analyzes it for traces of the virus.\nPCR tests, considered the most reliable, work by duplicating the genetic material in cycles until traces of the virus become more easily detectable. If there\u2019s a large presence of virus in the sample, fewer cycles would be required to detect it, said Davidson Hamer, a professor of medicine at Boston University.\nThe number of cycles required to detect the virus in a sample is known as a \"cycle threshold.\" A low cycle threshold implies that a patient has a high risk of spreading the coronavirus to others.\nThe question for lab technicians is how many times to duplicate a particular sample before determining whether it is positive or negative.\n\"Once you get up there in cycles, you can start detecting very small concentrations of virus,\" Hamer said.\nAs a result, a sample that tests positive after many amplification cycles is more likely to be a false positive than a sample that tests positive after fewer cycles. Nevertheless, Hamer said, false positives with PCR tests, even those with relatively high cycle thresholds, remain rare.\n\"PCR tests are considered the gold standard of diagnostic tests,\" said Maureen Ferran, an associate professor of biology at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\nJoshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, cautioned against viewing a low cycle threshold value as a strict indicator of high infectivity,\u00a0 because some samples are less representative of the patient\u2019s overall viral load than others.\n\"It depends on how good the sample is,\" he said. The cycle threshold value \"will measure the viral load for a particular sample, but not necessarily a patient.\"\nIn addition, the amount of cycles required to determine whether a patient is positive varies among different types of PCR tests.\n\"There are different tests that have different thresholds,\" said Ben Neuman, a Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist. \"Each lab knows where the thresholds are, and it\u2019s their job to give you the results of your test based on their setup.\"\nThat\u2019s why the WHO notice urges lab technicians to view weak positive test results (ones with high cycle thresholds) with caution and to consult the instructions on their PCR machinery before issuing positive or negative test results.\nGateway Pundit did not respond to our request for comment."}

Ron Johnson is turning to Green Bay Packers fans for support, confident that they aren\u2019t fans of the rival Minnesota Vikings.\nA Johnson radio ad released Oct. 25, 2016 starts with a strong claim, as the male narrator says:\n\"There\u2019s nothing like watching the Packers win on Sunday. But for some in Wisconsin, that\u2019s not possible. They\u2019re forced to watch Viking games.\"\nNot possible to watch Packers games?\n\"Ron Johnson believes all Wisconsinites deserve to enjoy Packer games, and their local news,\" the narrator continues. \"That\u2019s why, when he went to Washington, he got a law passed to fix it. And he did it in his first term. One broadcast station already plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties. And other broadcasters across northern Wisconsin will have the opportunity to offer coverage.\"\nRescuing thousands of Wisconsinites fans from having to watch Vikings games sounds like the politician\u2019s equivalent of returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.\nSo, why haven\u2019t we heard the crowds cheering?\nThe problem isn\u2019t as pervasive as the ad states.\nAnd, so far, the law only offers the possibility of fixing the problem.\n\u2018Not possible\u2019 in \u2018orphan counties\u2019\nThere is a phenomenon in broadcasting called \"orphan counties.\" It occurs when a county in one state is assigned to a local television market in a neighboring state. In 13 northern Wisconsin counties, including Ashland and Iron, according to a broadcast industry blog, the local channels, including the local news, are from stations in either the Minneapolis-St. Paul or Duluth TV markets.\nThat means that if the Packers and Vikings play at the same time on the same network, but not against each other, viewers in the orphan counties are shown the Vikings game, not the Packers game.\nThat occurred six times in the 2015 season and is expected to occur twice in the 2016 season (NFL game times are subject to change), according to the Ashland Daily Press.\nOn those days, viewers in orphan counties can see the Packers games only if they subscribe to a satellite service and pay an additional fee for NFL package.\nSo, Johnson overstates the problem when he says it\u2019s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games. That happens, at most, several times per season. But it\u2019s true that on those days, Wisconsinites in \"orphan counties\" are shown Vikings games rather than Packers games.\nNow to the fix Johnson talks about.\nThe law to \u2018fix it\u2019\nIn 2014, when Congress reauthorized a satellite television law, a provision was included to address the orphan counties problem. But it requires a petition to be filed and the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.\nSo, when Johnson says he \"got a law passed,\" it\u2019s not as though the law itself fixes the problem.\nJohnson takes credit for the petition provision. And while it\u2019s clear he supports the provision, doing so in a December 2015 letter to the FCC, his campaign could not cite evidence that he was responsible for the provision.\nSo, that part of the claim is unclear. But to be fair to Johnson, there isn\u2019t necessarily a formal record on how provisions get inserted into a law.\nJohnson does support the first petition filed under the new provision -- one filed in September 2016 by WSAW-TV in Wausau (part 1 and part 2).\nBut when the ad says one station \"plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties,\" that\u2019s misleading in that WSAW\u2019s petition must get FCC approval.\nThe petition seeks to have satellite providers -- there are two in the United States -- DirecTV and DISH Network -- carry its signal to some orphan county viewers, those in Ashland and Iron counties. That would allow satellite TV subscribers in those areas to see Packers games that aren\u2019t shown there now, without any additional fees.\n\"In a state where the Packers are publicly owned and religiously followed, orphan county viewers feel an affront akin to forcing Washington (Redskins) football fans to watch nothing but Dallas Cowboys,\" WSAW wrote to the FCC, which is based in Washington, D.C.\nBut the petition applies to only two of the orphan counties. Moreover, DirecTV told Johnson in October 2016 it was technically possible to carry WSAW\u2019s signal to only to four of 11 ZIP codes in Iron County.\nIn short, there are many unknowns.\nThe FCC told us it has until Feb. 6, 2017 to decide on WSAW\u2019s petition. WDIO-TV in Duluth is objecting to it. The FCC must determine whether granting the petition is in a county\u2019s interest and whether it would be economically and technically feasible for satellite providers to carry the WSAW signal. And if it approves the petition, the FCC might order only order one satellite carry to pick up WSAW\u2019s signal, not necessarily both.\nIndeed, one of Johnson\u2019s Senate staff members has essentially said that no fix has been achieved yet.\n\"Everything in government is slow, but we do think we are very close to a real solution that will give Wisconsinites real change,\" aide Brooke Ericson told the \u00a0Ashland newspaper in commenting about the WSAW petition. \"Just this petition going to the FCC, I think, is a further step in the right direction. It\u2019s more than any other senator or congressman for that matter has been able to achieve.\""}

Federal law requires broadcast networks to run political candidate ads without vetting them for lies or falsehoods. The same law does not apply to cable networks, but those networks also generally aim to run such ads, experts told us.\nWarren does have a point that federal law does not apply to online social networks such as Facebook, so Facebook can take candidate ads regardless of whether they include falsehoods.\nBut overall, it\u2019s inaccurate to say that \"most networks\" will refuse to air an ad by Trump with a lie in it. We could find no evidence that most networks reject false candidate ads.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.","full_article":"Sen. Elizabeth Warren escalated her battle to break up Facebook by posting an ad that intentionally included a false account about Mark Zuckerberg backing President Donald Trump.\nWarren\u2019s goal was to show that the social media giant allows misinformation by Trump.\n\"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\" the Oct. 10 ad began. \"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \"how could this possibly be true?\"\nThe ad then pivoted to a disclaimer \u2014 no, the Facebook CEO did not endorse Trump \u2014 before attacking Facebook: \"What Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2013-- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters. If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks.\"\nWarren\u2019s post followed an unsuccessful push by the Joe Biden campaign to get Facebook to reject a Trump campaign ad about Biden\u2019s role in the firing of a prosecutor in Ukraine. PolitiFact rated a statement in a similar Trump ad False. Facebook denied Biden\u2019s request.\nWe decided to fact-check Warren\u2019s claim that unlike Facebook, most TV networks will refuse to air a political campaign ad that contains falsehoods.\nWhile the Warren campaign cited a half dozen examples in recent years of TV networks or stations rejecting ads, we found that broadcast networks are generally required to run candidate ads under federal law. The same law doesn\u2019t apply to cable networks or to PAC ads.\nFacebook\u2019s policy on ads\nFacebook does have a partnership with third-party fact-checkers -- including PolitiFact -- to debunk viral hoaxes and demote that content. But Facebook exempts politicians from the fact-checking program, stating that it won\u2019t \"referee political debates\" or block a politician\u2019s speech from an audience.\nWhile Facebook drew attention for an announcement in September about exempting political candidates, that had already been Facebook\u2019s policy since 2017.\nChristopher Terry, a University of Minnesota professor of communications and expert on political advertising, said that because Facebook is a private unregulated platform, it can do what it wants.\n\"Because Facebook is its own playground, it gets to make its own rules,\" he said.\nFacebook has set rules about transparency to show who paid for ads. But it doesn\u2019t restrict political content.\nFederal rules for television\nThere are rules, however, for television.\nSection 315 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 states:\n\"If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provision of this section.\"\nIt also specifically says licensees can\u2019t censor \"material broadcast by any such candidate.\"\nBroadcasters are bound by that act and therefore can\u2019t reject a presidential candidate\u2019s ad, even if contains false information. (The candidates do have to abide by disclosure rules to make it clear who paid for the ad.)\nEvery election season, some candidates argue that they have been unfairly attacked and that broadcasters should take down ads, wrote David Oxenford, a lawyer who has represented broadcasters for decades and is a partner at Wilkinson Barker Knauer LLP.\nHowever, \"broadcasters can\u2019t censor a candidate ad, so they can\u2019t reject it (or remove it from the air) no matter what its content is,\" Oxenford wrote.\nThere are caveats.The law does not apply to PACs or independent expenditure ads. And, importantly, the rules for political ads have been interpreted not to apply to cable networks such as CNN. The rules do apply to local cable operators.\nCable networks somewhat subscribe to the idea in the act that they won\u2019t censor content, but they aren\u2019t bound by it, Terry said.\nCNN rejected an ad about Biden and the Ukraine prosecutor. The ad mentioned \"media lapdogs\" for the Democrats as it showed footage of CNN stars.\nThe ad disparages CNN and \"makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets,\" a CNN spokesperson told PolitiFact.\nThat ad was one of a handful of ads the Warren campaign cited as examples of political ads TV or radio rejected in recent years. Multiple stations and Facebook ultimately rejected a Trump ad about a migrant caravan in 2018 that critics said was racist.\nWe sent Warren\u2019s examples to Terry, the University of Minnesota professor. He said that Warren\u2019s examples included issue ads, which aren\u2019t covered by the rule.\n\"It\u2019s only the campaign ads that are protected from the no-censorship provision,\" he said.\nThe Warren campaign also cited an FCC website page that states broadcasters should \"act with reasonable care to ensure that advertisements aired on their stations are not false or misleading.\" However, it\u2019s the FCC law that bans censorship that truly carries weight.\nWe also found that in May 2017, multiple networks refused to air a Trump ad about his first 100 days that had a \"fake news\" graphic superimposed over the photos of news anchors. It appeared networks rejected the ad by making a case that Trump didn\u2019t yet meet the legal qualifications of a candidate more than three years before the election."}

And for each of those issues except single-payer health care, a more modest percentage of all Americans \u2014 but still a majority \u2014 signal their support.\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that support levels by all Americans drop significantly once voters are informed about the policies\u2019 costs, often to majority disapproval. And on health care policy, Buttigieg\u2019s plan \u2014 the public option to buy into Medicare \u2014 is more popular than Sanders\u2019 single-payer proposal is, both among all voters and among Democrats.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.","full_article":"In his speech after the Nevada caucuses, Pete Buttigieg took a shot at his rival Bernie Sanders, who had just won a clear victory.\n\"Sen. Sanders sees capitalism as the root of all evil,\" Buttigieg said. \"He\u2019d go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats \u2014 let alone most Americans \u2014 don\u2019t support.\"\nButtigieg is wrong to say most Democrats don\u2019t support Sanders\u2019 agenda. Polling shows that key elements of Sanders\u2019 economic platform are strongly popular among Democrats. And several of them score majority support among all voters.\nHowever, support among all voters for some of Sanders\u2019 proposals declines when poll respondents are told about the costs. And in some cases, less-aggressive policy options \u2014 some of them backed by Sanders\u2019 competitors \u2014 receive wider support from voters than his proposals do.\nWould Sanders\u2019 platform \"reorder the economy\"?\nWe looked at several elements of Sanders\u2019 platform that could potentially have an impact on the economy. They include instituting single-payer health care; the Green New Deal to combat climate change; tuition-free college; student debt forgiveness; a $15 minimum wage; breaking up big banks, and paid family leave.\nWe found broad acceptance among economists that at least some of these policies would qualify as \"reordering\" the economy.\nBy shifting payments from private insurers to the federal government, single-payer health care would dramatically change the health care sector, which accounts for 17.7% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\nThis policy, and breaking up big banks, \"would change things in a major way,\" said Stanford University economist Roger Noll. \"These are huge sectors.\"\nThe Green New Deal would affect a smaller, but still substantial, share of the economy that relates to energy, by setting aggressive targets for phasing out fossil fuels. The proposal also includes a federal job guarantee.\nEconomists\u2019 views vary on the scale of the other proposals, but some said that changes to the higher-education sector \u2014 making college tuition free and forgiving student loan debt \u2014 could have a significant impact on the economy. And while the impact of other aspects of Sanders\u2019 plan, such as a $15 minimum wage or paid family leave, might be less dramatic, they could have significant effects on certain regions and employment sectors.\n\"It's quite fair to say he is reordering the economy, given the massive transfer of money from the private sector to the government,\" said Daniel Mitchell, a pro-free market economist.\nHow popular are Sanders\u2019 proposals?\nWe collected recent poll results on most of these proposals and put them into the chart below. The questions in these polls did not identify the ideas as being backed by Sanders, and they offered basic descriptions of the plans, without mentioning complications, such as the cost involved.\nThe data shows that \u2014 contrary to what Buttigieg said \u2014 a large share of Democrats support Sanders\u2019 economic proposals, according to polls. Among Democrats, single-payer health care receives upwards of 58% support, the Green New Deal gets 86%, a $15 minimum wage gets 84%, tuition-free college gets 76%, student-loan forgiveness gets 79%, breaking up big banks gets 60%, and paid family leave gets 94%.\nAmong all Americans, only one of these policies \u2014 single-payer health care \u2014 gets less than 50% support. Paid family leave got 84% support, while the other policies had support levels in the 53% to 63% range among all voters.\nWarning signs\nThat said, other poll results give Buttigieg\u2019s remark some support.\nFirst, when we inquired about his comment, the Buttigieg camp pointed to health insurance.\nAs it turns out, Buttigieg\u2019s own policy preference \u2014 a public option to buy into Medicare for those who want it \u2014 wins majority support from all Americans, a level of support significantly stronger than the 30% to 40% national approval rates for a Sanders-style single-payer system.\nIn February 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll found that 44% of voters preferred a public option, compared to 26% of voters who preferred single-payer and 23% who opposed both. Democrats alone also expressed a preference for the public option, with 51% favoring the public option compared to 39% for single-payer.\nSecond, providing poll respondents with more complete descriptions of a policy option \u2014 often including the cost required \u2014 usually reduced the levels of support. Here are some examples:\n\u2022 $15 minimum wage. A SurveyMonkey poll conducted for Business Insider asked two questions about the $15 minimum wage. The first was, \"Do you support or oppose increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour?\" This question elicited 63% support among all respondents.\nThe second question added that the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 the non-partisan number-crunching arm of Congress \u2014 found that a $15 minimum wage would increase wages for 27 million workers and lift 1.3 million households out of poverty, but could also eliminate 1.3 million jobs. Adding this caveat dropped support levels to just 37%.\n\u2022 Student loan forgiveness. A Quinnipiac University poll in April 2019 asked two questions about a plan for student loan forgiveness.\nFirst, the pollsters asked, \"Do you support or oppose the federal government forgiving up to $50,000 in student loans for individuals who live in households that make less than $250,000 a year?\" This won support from 57% of all Americans, and 79% of Democrats.\nThen they asked, \"Would you support or oppose this plan to forgive student loans if it was paid for by a new tax on wealthy individuals?\" On this question, Democratic support remained strong \u2014 72% \u2014 but reaction among respondents overall turned negative, with 44% support and 52% opposition.\n\u2022 Paid family leave. A survey sponsored by the libertarian Cato Institute showed strong initial support \u2014 74% among all respondents \u2014 for a paid family leave program granting 12 weeks for birth, adoption, or medical need. But support dropped significantly when possible impacts were mentioned. The poll found that only 48% would still support the policy if it cost another $450 a year in taxes.\n\u2022 Green New Deal. A Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll in July and August 2019 found broad support for individual elements of the Green New Deal, which Sanders backs. These include a jobs guarantee (78%), energy efficiency improvements for existing buildings (70%), a goal of 100 percent of U.S. power coming from emissions-free sources within 10 years (69%), increased federal spending on disaster-prevention infrastructure (67%), new regulations on businesses (61%), and reductions in coal mining jobs (55%).\nThe one unpopular aspect of the plan? Increasing spending by trillions of dollars, which was backed by just 30% of respondents."}

Phil Scott touted his administration's overwhelming success in fighting opioid addiction.\n\"We had a waiting list (for drug treatment) in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700,\" Scott said at a gubernatorial debate in Rutland last month. \"We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero.\"\nThat gave us pause \u2013 did waitlists for treatment in Chittenden plummet from 700 to zero during Scott\u2019s tenure?\nWe asked the campaign for evidence to back up the candidate\u2019s claims, but we never heard back. The Vermont Department of Health, however, closely tracks waitlists at the state\u2019s six \"hubs,\" the regional centers where people addicted to opioids can get high-intensity medication-assisted treatment.\nState data indicates the governor is off on the original waitlist number \u2013 by several hundred. In January 2017, when Scott took office, there were 145 people on hub waitlists statewide, and only 134 on the waitlist for the Chittenden hub.\nHubs are the lynchpin of Vermont\u2019s hub-and-spoke drug treatment model. Drug treatment is typically initiated at hubs, where people suffering from opioid abuse disorder can get daily doses of their medication, along with counseling and referrals to social services. Less intensive services are provided at so-called \"spokes,\" a collection of about 90 providers made up of doctor\u2019s offices and community clinics, where patients can get follow-up care.\nThe numbers tracked by the state do show a precipitous decline in waitlists at hubs since 2017. In fact, in 2018, there were no waitlists for treatment at any hubs in March, May, June, July and August, the last month for which data is available.\nIn Chittenden County, the state hasn\u2019t counted a single person on a waitlist at the Howard Center\u2019s Chittenden Clinic, the regional hub for Chittenden and Addison counties, from September 2017 to August 2018, except for one blip in April 2018, when two people were on the waitlist.\nDana Poverman, the director of Medication Assisted Treatment at the Howard Center Chittenden Clinic, said the number on the waitlist is still zero.\n\"We\u2019ve really come a long way in terms of access to medicine-assisted treatment,\" she said. That\u2019s thanks in large part, Poverman said, to the opening of the state\u2019s sixth hub in St. Albans and a dramatic increase in spoke providers.\nLess is known about what waitlists look like at Vermont\u2019s spokes. The state doesn\u2019t formally track how many people might be waiting for treatment from providers.\nBeth Tanzman, the executive director of the Blueprint for Health, which oversees the spokes, says the state has \"a pretty good sense of what access looks like\" through regular check-ins.\n\"Our understanding right now is that we are able to get everyone into care easily within 72 hours,\" she said.\nIn Chittenden County, people are typically able to access same-day treatment, Tanzman said. In Middlebury and Springfield, where there is a dearth of spoke providers, immediate care is more difficult to obtain."}

But they\u2019ve also noted that the supporting evidence is now somewhat dated.\nFor this fact check, we examined whether current available data support McCarthy\u2019s claim.\nOur research\nPast fact-checks, including one by PolitiFact Virginia in 2016, have relied on a 2006 Pew Research Center report. It estimated \"nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials.\"\nEach year, the United States grants thousands of temporary visas for foreign students, tourists and workers. They can last from a few weeks to several years.\nThe Pew report put the share of visa overstayers at \"as much as 45 percent of the total unauthorized migrant population.\" The study, however, used data more than two decades old from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an agency that doesn\u2019t exist anymore and whose functions were folded into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\"The problem is that neither the INS nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed visas since that aging study,\" PolitiFact Virginia reported in 2016.\nMore recent data\nSarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an email that recent DHS reports include data limited to foreign visitors who arrived by air and sea crossings, but not by land.\n\"They do not tell you anything about the full population of overstays,\" she wrote.\nShe said a 2017 study by the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank, is more helpful.\nThat report estimated visa overstays in 2014 accounted for 42 percent of the total undocumented population, or about 4.5 million people. It also projected that overstays made up about two-thirds of the total number of people who became unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. that year.\nMcCarthy\u2019s claim of \"half\" is not far from the 42 percent figure.\nAsked to support the congressman\u2019s statement, McCarthy\u2019s spokesman pointed to a recent article by The Washington Post that cited the Center for Migration Studies report.\nThe center\u2019s report said its figures \"are based primarily on detailed estimates of the undocumented population in 2014 compiled by (the Center for Migration Studies) and estimates of overstays for 2015 derived by DHS.\"\nShare of overstays on the rise?\nGiven the past decade\u2019s dramatic and well-documented decline in illegal Southern border crossings, there\u2019s a strong case that visa overstayers now account for a larger share of the overall total of unauthorized immigrants.\nIn April, we rated \u2018True,\u2019 Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s claim in a letter to the Trump administration that \"immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they\u2019ve been in nearly 50 years.\"\nBrown\u2019s office cited U.S. Border Patrol figures showing nearly 304,000 arrests in 2017 across the borders of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The previous low was just under 264,000 in 1971.\nArrest totals along the Southern border reached well over 1 million annually in the 1980s and 1990s. They peaked at 1.64 million in 2000.\nAlex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, told PolitiFact Virginia in 2016 that while estimates of undocumented immigrants have been stable since 2007, the number of people entering illegally across the southwestern U.S. border has \"collapsed.\"\nThat means that the proportion of those overstaying their visas likely is on the rise, he said in 2016.\nWe asked Nowrasteh whether that still holds true in 2018.\n\"Yes, about half of illegal immigrants currently are overstays,\" he told us by email."}

However, property crime on the whole is not rising this year. In fact, it has dropped by 2% compared to last year. Although property crime increased slightly in 2018 and 2019, property crime has dropped significantly over the past decade.\nThe article Abbott referenced also cited data that showed crime rates as of August, which is before cuts to APD\u2019s budget took effect on Oct. 1.\nThe second part of his claim, that increased property crime is \"the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police,\" appears to be based on assumption. Researchers have demonstrated how numerous intervening factors confound the relationship between police force size and crime. Rather, strategic crime deterrent strategies are seen as having a more direct impact on crime rates.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.","full_article":"As part of a sustained campaign to criticize the Austin City Council\u2019s August decision to cut police funding, Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted on Oct. 1: \"Property crime rising in Austin This is the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police. Residents are left to fend for themselves.\"\nThe tweet cited a KVUE article that highlighted an advisory from the Austin Police Department warning residents to secure their homes before going on a trip. The article noted 2,983 burglaries had occurred through the first eight months of this year \u2014 an 11% increase over the first eight months of last year, according to the Austin Police Department\u2019s August crime report.\nBut burglary is not the only form of property crime, and Abbott\u2019s assertion that property crime is rising in Austin fails to take that into account.\nProperty crime generally has been falling in Austin, with the notable recent exceptions of 2018 and 2019. So far this year, property crime has dropped slightly. And Abbott\u2019s attempt to link crime to the City Council\u2019s budget decision misses the mark.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Abbott has sounded off on Austin crime.\nIn August, Abbott claimed that crime is on the rise in Austin, citing data that showed a jump in homicides over the first six months of the year. We rated that claim Half True.\nAustin\u2019s property crime\nEach month, the Austin Police Department posts to its website the Chief\u2019s Monthly Report, which tallies the number and category of crimes officers respond to each month. The 2,983 burglaries cited in the KVUE article comprise 9% of all property crimes recorded through August. Other crimes that fall into this category include shoplifting, credit card fraud, embezzlement and vandalism.\nAustin police responded to nearly 34,000 total property crimes through August, which is a 2% drop compared with 2019. According to FBI data, property crime in Austin increased in 2018 by 8.5% and in 2019 by 8.7%.\nBut taking a longer view, the property crime rate has generally been falling over the last decade. In addition to 2018 and 2019, the only other year since 2010 when the rate did not drop compared to the previous year was in 2012.\nIn 2010 Austin police responded to nearly 46,000 reports of property crime, or about 5.8 incidents per 100 residents, according to federal data. In 2019, officers responded to 36,588 reports, or about 3.7 incidents per 100 residents. Burglaries specifically also have been dropping, from about 1.1 incidents per 100 residents in 2010 to about 0.4 in 2019.\nAbbott is not the only Texas elected official who\u2019s rebuked Austin leaders for cutting the Austin police budget. Several other Republicans have seized on Austin\u2019s police spending as an issue in their reelection campaigns.\nThe perception of high crime in Austin reflects a popular misconception that crime is always on the rise despite a general downward trend, said Texas State University criminologist Sean Roche. On average, crime in the U.S. has declined since the mid-1990s to historically low and stable levels.\nThat\u2019s generally true for Austin\u2019s property crime rates as well. Federal data going back to 1985 show a peak of property crime incidents in 1990 followed by a decade of low property crime until a smaller peak in 2009.\n\"Even though crime went up in the 60s, 70s and 80s and then started declining in the 90s, most of the public did not ever catch wise of this,\" Roche said. \"There\u2019s a significant chunk of people in the U.S. that always think crime is getting worse.\"\nSome researchers have suggested that a false perception of high crime may be attributable to a person\u2019s level of media exposure, especially local TV news. A study published in 2018 by Roche and colleagues note that this misperception may have significant implications for criminal justice policies, which are \"particularly sensitive to public opinion\" compared to other policy domains.\n\"Over-concern about crime is likely to mobilize the public to be more punitive, thereby fueling support for increased law enforcement spending and harsh sentencing policies,\" Roche and his coauthors wrote. \"Public punitiveness is one of the strongest predictors of both federal and state incarceration rates.\"\nCrime and police budgets\nAfter asserting that the property crime rate in Austin is rising, Abbott\u2019s tweet goes on to claim that rising crime is \"the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police.\"\nIt\u2019s unclear what the governor means when he says \"deemphasize police\" \u2014 his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment \u2014 but we can be sure what city he\u2019s referring to when talking about defunding. The Austin City Council recently decided to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shifted another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments to continue civilian-run functions, such as the 911 call center and forensics.\nThe cuts came after protests against police brutality in Austin and across the nation demanded police reforms in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody in May.\nBut how the council\u2019s budgetary decisions will affect the department\u2019s daily operations, especially in regard to property crime, is not yet known.\n\"In terms of staffing changes, that\u2019s something we\u2019re still working on,\" said Austin police spokeswoman Tara Long. \"We\u2019re still working on those specifics.\"\nAustin Police Chief Brian Manley indicated in August that the department may reduce or eliminate about a dozen police units while reassigning those officers to patrol duties. The cuts also will cancel three upcoming cadet classes and reduce overtime spending.\nBut does a smaller police force automatically heighten crime? Research would suggest that there is a weak or nonexistent connection between the two. One systematic review by criminologists at the University of Cincinnati concludes that the overall effect of police force size on crime is \"statistically not significant,\" although it is possible that force size might influence some crimes more than others.\n\"Policy makers who want police to have an impact on crime would be better suited investing resources in new evidence-based strategies than funding surges in police hiring,\" the 2016 review says.\nRather, crime trends are more influenced by macro-level drivers, like the prevalence of firearms in a community, alcohol consumption, drug use, unemployment and a population\u2019s age structure, Roche said.\n\"Austin, on average, has historically been a very safe city,\" he said. \"It\u2019s premature to say definitively that a budget decision that was made a couple months ago has already had these very dramatic impacts on crime rates. We just don\u2019t know.\""}

The footage doesn\u2019t show any wrongdoing, said Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia\u2019s voting system implementation manager, in a Dec. 4 tweet.\n\"The 90 second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by @GaSecofState investigators,\" Sterling wrote, linking to a fact-check from Lead Stories. \"Shows normal ballot processing.\"\nThe 90 second video of election workers at State Farm arena, purporting to show fraud was watched in its entirety (hours) by @GaSecofState investigators.

They also talked to Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s chief investigator, and an unidentified state election board monitor who was present in the room late on election night.\nThe ballots seen in the video were not in suitcases, the officials told Lead Stories. They were in standard ballot containers. And there was nothing illegal about the way they were processed.\nIn reality, the ballots had been removed from their envelopes and processed while news media personnel and observers were still in the room. Nobody was ever told to leave, Watson told Lead Stories. But some observers exited after the election workers responsible for opening the envelopes and verifying the ballots had finished their job and started taking off for the night.\nThe observers were allowed to return at any time, Watson told Lead Stories. Lead Stories and Georgia Public Broadcasting reported that while the state\u2019s law allows partisan observers to watch, it does not actually require that they be present for ballots to be counted.\nThat lines up with the sequence of events Sterling described in response to a Facebook post about the video. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\"When the workers began packing up to go, there were two groups, the cutters and the counters. Cutters opened, stacked and prepared ballots for scanning. Scanners \u2026 well, they scanned. All of them heard a supervisor say we are finishing for the night, because the cutters had completed their work. The scanners heard they were \u2018done\u2019 and started packing up to leave. During that time the elections director called the absentee supervisor at State Farm to tell him the scanners needed to continue their work. So people had already started to leave or had left \u2026 cutters, media, monitors. But the video shows no new boxes of ballots brought out from a table, they were all there when the media and monitors were in the room. The video shows them getting back to work scanning. When the (state elections board) monitor arrives they continue to do the same thing they had been doing all night.

In a video published online by 11Alive, the NBC affiliate TV station in Atlanta, he described sending instructions for the scanners to keep going.\n\"No announcement was ever made to leave, for anyone to leave,\" Barron said. \"Certain staff that were on the cutting stations, that were on the flattening stations, that were extracting from the inner envelopes, those staff left as work completed.

Clinton did claim that she landed in Bosnia under sniper fire and that there was no greeting ceremony. She later retracted the entire statement.\nThe only flaw in Trump\u2019s speech is he said Clinton was handed flowers. It was a poem, which seems like a trivial difference.\nWe rate this claim True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/ea63fd8e-0b2a-4426-9a73-fab000398202","full_article":"Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump wasted no time punching back the day after Hillary Clinton listed in detail why he could not be trusted to run the economy.\nClinton \"is a world-class liar,\" Trump said in a June 22, 2016, speech in New York. \"Just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers.\"\nOn that Bosnia trip, Trump picked one of Clinton\u2019s most prominent transgressions. When she made that claim, we rated it Pants on Fire in 2008. Here\u2019s why.\nDuring an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996.\n\"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\"\nBut that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post Fact Checker also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady.\nCBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit, wrote of her memories of the trip: \"To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. \"\nImmediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. \"There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,\" she said.\nBut she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she \"misspoke,\" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, \"So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation.\"\nOn the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. The Des Moines Register reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, \"We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there.\"\nInterestingly, Clinton's memoir Living History depicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling:\n\"Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.' \"\nThere's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. And there was a welcoming ceremony where a young girl gave her a poem."}

They would automatically be enrolled. That\u2019s a big difference. Because Barack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\"\nBIDEN: \"They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.\"\nCASTRO: \"You just said that! You just said that two minutes ago!\"\nBIDEN: \"No.\"\nCASTRO: \"You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in!\"\nBIDEN: \"I said if they cannot afford it!\"\nCASTRO: \"You said they would have to buy in!\"\nBIDEN: \"They would not have to buy in. If you qualified for Medicaid, they would automatically be enrolled.\"\nCASTRO: \"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago? I mean, I can\u2019t believe you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t have to buy in. You\u2019re forgetting that!\"\nBIDEN: \"I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money, you\u2019re automatically enrolled.\"\nCASTRO: \"It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.\"\nBIDEN: \"That'll be a surprise to him.\"\nCastro\u2019s criticism falls into two categories. We\u2019ll look at them both.\nDoes Biden\u2019s plan require people who want the public option to \"opt in\"?\nBiden does require those who want Medicare coverage to \"opt in,\" but this requirement is not nearly as significant as Castro makes it seem.\nAs described on his campaign website, Biden\u2019s health care plan advocates \"giving Americans a new choice, a public health insurance option like Medicare. If your insurance company isn\u2019t doing right by you, you should have another, better choice. Whether you\u2019re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, the Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare.\"\nBiden\u2019s plan would \"ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. He\u2019ll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they interact with certain institutions, such as public schools, or other programs for low-income populations, such as SNAP,\" or food stamps.\nThis tracks with what Biden said at one point in the debate \u2014 that \"anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\"\nOn the surface, this is a difference with Castro\u2019s plan. Castro\u2019s proposal would \"strengthen Medicare for those who have it, and expand it to achieve universal healthcare coverage by including all Americans within the program.\" Castro would \"allow individuals to obtain supplementary private insurance or opt out of Medicare if they have a high-standard private insurance plan through an employer or organization that is regulated under the Affordable Care Act.\"\nBut Castro\u2019s opt-out plan and Biden\u2019s opt-in plan don\u2019t seem significantly different.\nCastro makes it sound like Biden\u2019s opting-in process would be a noteworthy barrier. More likely, it would amount to a formality. Anyone who wanted the public option would have to request it and, presumably, sign forms like every other person seeking health insurance. But the important part is that they could not be rejected after they fill out those forms.\nThe distinction between filling out the paperwork to become part of the public option (as Biden would have it) and automatically becoming enrolled unless you actively reject it (which would, at some point, also require different paperwork) does not strike us as the \"big difference\" Castro touted.\nDid Biden contradict himself?\nCastro\u2019s second line of attack was that Biden initially said people would have to opt in to Medicare and then later changed his tune and said they wouldn\u2019t have to opt in.\nBiden did say at several points before Castro challenged him that enrollment would be automatic \u2014 essentially a formality.\nBiden said that \"anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\"\nHe also said, \"If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance \u2014 from your employer \u2014 you automatically can buy into this. No pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.\"\nAnd Biden also said, \"Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.\"\nThese are consistent with Biden\u2019s response to Castro\u2019s attack, that Americans who need the Medicare option would \"automatically be enrolled.\""}

Now what I\u2019ve also said is that \u2014 and she has acknowledged \u2014 that there\u2019s a carelessness, in terms of managing emails, that she has owned, and she recognizes.\n\"But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective. This is somebody who has served her country for four years as secretary of state, and did an outstanding job. And no one has suggested that in some ways, as a consequence of how she\u2019s handled emails, that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties.\"\nThis interview and Trump\u2019s private conversation with Comey are not the same.\nObama, speaking in a public setting, said he believed Clinton \"has not jeopardized America\u2019s national security.\" But he never said outright that the FBI should end its investigation, nor did he say Clinton was innocent. In fact, Obama acknowledged the ongoing FBI investigation.\nIn contrast, reports by the New York Times\u00a0and others say Trump told the director of the FBI, explicitly and directly, what he hoped he would do regarding an ongoing investigation.\nAccording to the reports about Comey\u2019s memo of the private White House conversation with Trump, Trump said, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\"\nFor the record, the White House denies the reports.\nThere are clear differences between the situations.\n\"Obama was speaking to the press and expressing his confidence in the integrity of Secretary Clinton, which is not the same thing as asking the director of the FBI not to pursue an investigation,\" said Rebecca Lonergan, a University of Southern California law professor and former public corruption prosecutor.\nA reasonable person could critique Obama for offering his opinion on an ongoing investigation instead of saying \"no comment.\" Indeed, some legal commentators and conservative pundits accused Obama at the time of subtly putting his thumb on the scale.\nBut legal scholars\u2019 reaction to Trump\u2019s reported actions has been much more robust. Trump\u2019s private meeting with Comey, coupled with Trump\u2019s decision to fire him, raises legitimate questions of impropriety.\nPeter Henning, a Wayne State University law professor and white collar crime expert, said he isn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s actions count as obstruction of justice.\n(Obstruction of justice, presidential immunity, impeachment: What you need to know)\nBut Obama\u2019s remarks \u2014 delivered in a public setting without addressing a particular agent, witness or other involved party \u2014 are much less significant, he said.\n\"The difference between them is (that Trump\u2019s actions are) probably enough to initiate an investigation,\" Henning said.\nLimbaugh\u2019s assertion misses another obvious point: Trump has gone beyond what Obama said about Clinton\u2019s ongoing investigation. Trump has repeatedly defended Flynn in media interviews and on Twitter, without expressing caution about ongoing probes.\n\"Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!\" he tweeted March 31.\n\"Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation,\" he said in a Feb. 16 press conference. \"He respectfully gave it.

And he called that vote brave.\"\nShe\u2019s right about Burr\u2019s vote and the fact that Burr called it brave. What\u2019s less clear is whether the STOCK Act simply clarified the law regarding insider trading in Congress, or made actual changes. Regardless, the law did make other changes that Burr ignores when he says his opposition was because the bill was totally duplicative.\nWe rate this claim True.","full_article":"Deborah Ross, the Democratic challenger for Republican Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s seat representing North Carolina in the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said Burr is a consummate Washington insider.\nThis summer she claimed that Burr \"took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks.\" We rated that Half True.\nMore recently, she has been claiming Burr voted against a bill that would\u2019ve banned members of Congress from insider trading.\n\"It is a fact that Sen. Burr was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress,\" Ross said in their recent debate. \"And he called that vote brave.\"\nBurr doesn\u2019t deny the vote in question, but he repeatedly said it\u2019s being blown way out of proportion. He defended his actions in 2012 after the vote, and again last month at his debate with Ross.\nWe wondered what the real story was.\nInsider trading\nInsider trading is when someone uses non-public information to buy or sell stocks to maximize profit. Depending on the circumstances, it can be legal or illegal.\nIn April 2012, the STOCK Act \u2013 which stands for Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge \u2013 specifically said lawmakers could not use their insider knowledge to trade stocks. It also created several new or stronger ethics and transparency provisions for members of Congress and their staffs.\nPresident Obama asked Congress to pass the bill in his 2012 State of the Union address. A few months later, he got his wish and signed it into law with much fanfare. It was a rare moment of bipartisan celebration, although Ross is right that Burr was one of three holdouts.\nBurr said insider trading was already illegal, so there was no need to pass another law singling out members of Congress.\n\"It is illegal, in law, even for Congress, to trade on insider trading,\" Burr said in response to Ross\u2019 barb at their debate. \"That\u2019s the reason I opposed the STOCK Act. North Carolinians did not send me to Washington to duplicate existing law, and that\u2019s in fact what the STOCK Act did.\"\nBurr, however, is wrong to speak so definitively about that claim.\nLegal confusion\nThere is no statutory definition of when exactly insider trading becomes illegal, so it\u2019s often up to individual judges or investigators to decide.\nWhile Congress was never specifically exempted from insider trading rules, there was widespread disagreement in the legal and financial communities over what officials could or couldn\u2019t do.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for a 59-page legal analysis of the differing opinions, read this 2011 paper. Or, here\u2019s a brief synopsis: Some people said the law applied to everyone in Congress. Some\u00a0said elected officials had to abide by insider trading laws, but their staffers did not. Some said both elected officials and their staffs were exempt.\nSince the Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of policing insider trading, we decided to see what its officials thought at the time. Unfortunately, two high-level officials gave opposite interpretations of the law.\nFormer SEC CEO Arthur Levitt said in 2010 that elected officials and their staffers \"benefit from an exemption that the average investor doesn\u2019t benefit from. They\u2019re immune from insider trading laws.\" However, former SEC director of enforcement Robert Khuzami said in 2011 that neither elected officials nor their staffers were \"exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions.\"\nSo\u00a0the STOCK Act at least cleared up confusion from 2012 onward. And at best, it made real changes.\nCongressional suspicions\nRegardless of the lack of clarity in the law, we do know that members of Congress and their staffers routinely made timely trades centered around upcoming policy decisions.\nOne 2004 paper found that senators who made stock trades outperformed the market by an impressive 12 percent, on average.\n\"Since even the best hedge-fund managers find it hard to achieve comparable results, we must conclude that these senators either are better than hedge-fund managers, or that they benefit from privileged information,\" Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, wrote in 2011.\nZingales said it was his opinion that members of Congress did participate in insider trading, \"despite the potential cost to their reputations.\"\nIn 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigated allegations of insider trading by congressional staffers. It found dozens of aides on both sides of the aisle had invested tens of\u00a0thousands of dollars in stocks that soon benefitted from their bosses\u2019 policy decisions.\nOne aide nearly doubled his investment in a renewable energy company just before his boss pushed for a new law that benefitted companies like it. Another aide bought thousands of dollars worth of Bank Of America stock just before a report \u2013 which her boss was involved in \u2013 found in the bank\u2019s favor and sent stock prices surging.\nOther parts of the STOCK Act\nYet even if Burr is right that insider trading laws applied to Congress that whole time \u2013 and it appears no one knows the real answer to that \u2013 he\u2019s still not correct that the law was purely duplicative.\nThe STOCK Act also strengthened the power of ethics investigators in Congress and expanded transparency requirements \u2013 although Congress quietly rolled back the transparency requirements within a year of passing the original bill.\nBut is Ross also right that Burr called himself brave for voting against the STOCK Act? Yes, and we found the transcript of his remarks on Burr\u2019s own website.\n\"It's ludicrous,\" Burr said in a February 2012 radio interview, while discussions over the bill were still ongoing. \"That's why Dr. Tom Coburn (a Republican senator from Oklahoma) and I were the two brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn't be doing this.\"\nBurr and Coburn joined with Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico in casting the only \u2018no\u2019 votes when the bill passed the Senate 96-3."}

Tony Evers issued a statewide face mask mandate, despite opposition from Republicans who contend the move amounts to government overreach.\nIn the days before that, though, the state Senate\u2019s Democratic Committee turned its frustration toward Republican lawmakers.\n\"While neighboring states like Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have already implemented safety precautions like requiring individuals to wear masks, similar pleas in Wisconsin have fallen on deaf ears of Republican legislators,\" stated a July 24 news release.\nLawmakers in those states have passed more COVID-19-related bills than Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature since the pandemic began. But some precautions, like a mask mandate, came from executive orders and not legislation.\nHow does the committee\u2019s claim stack up?\nWhat Wisconsin has done (or not)\nEric LaGesse, executive director of the Senate\u2019s Democratic committee, did not respond to PolitiFact Wisconsin\u2019s request for evidence to back up their claim. But the claim is pretty straightforward, and there has been a lot of news coverage of the state\u2019s response to the pandemic. Here\u2019s a recap:\nIn March, Evers and Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm issued a series of orders to curb large gatherings as COVID-19 began to emerge in Wisconsin. Those actions culminated in a stay-at-home order on March 24, 2020, which shut down the state to help contain the virus\u2019 spread.\nIn April, lawmakers passed a coronavirus relief package that allowed the state to tap into extra federal Medicaid dollars and suspended a one-week waiting period for collecting unemployment benefits, among other provisions. However, the state lost $25 million in federal funding for unemployment because Republican leaders waited too long to schedule a floor session on the relief package.\nEvers\u2019 administration extended the stay-at-home order on April 16 and four days later unveiled the Badger Bounce Back plan, which provided a phased approach for reopening based on testing and other public health criteria. In May, acting on a lawsuit from state GOP leaders, the state Supreme Court struck down much of the order and allowed the state to reopen without any protocols in place.\nAfter that, not much happened at the state level until the mask mandate despite a recent surge in infections and multiple daily increases of over 1,000 cases.\nLawmakers have introduced 10 bills related to the pandemic in recent months, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The relief package we mentioned earlier is the only one that\u2019s passed.\nWhat about our neighbors?\nThe Democratic committee argued neighboring states -- specifically Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan -- have implemented more safety precautions for their residents.\nAccording to a database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures, Minnesota enacted 25 pieces of legislation related to COVID-19 through July 23 after lawmakers introduced over 200 measures. Illinois has passed 18, and Michigan approved 19. The bills touch on a wide range of issues, from COVID-19 testing to election procedures.\nThe differences between Wisconsin and its neighbors can\u2019t be blamed on partisan gridlock, either. While Democrats control Illinois\u2019 state government, Minnesota\u2019s legislature is split between both parties with a Democrat in the governor\u2019s office. Michigan, like Wisconsin, has a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, though, that some of the precautions in other states came about through executive orders by their governors, not action by the legislature. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzer, for example, issued an order on June 26 requiring residents to wear face coverings -- over a month before Evers enacted a mask mandate in Wisconsin.\nGovernors in other states also enacted stay-at-home orders similar to what Evers implemented."}

We flagged one claim from John R.

Our rate was tied with Chile\u2019s, and just slightly above the average for developed countries.\"\nLott\u2019s claim has a couple areas worthy of fact checking. First of all, do Russia\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s crime rates match what Lott said? And second, are Russia and Brazil even considered to be developed countries as Lott seems to indicate?\nJust the numbers\nPunditFact reached out to Lott for more information about his claim. Lott cited data gathered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\nAccording to the report (which includes statistics for 2011, the latest available year), the United States has a homicide rate of 5.2 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Comparatively, Russia has a homicide rate of 12.8 murders, and Brazil has a rate of 25.5 murders.\nWith these numbers, Russia\u2019s rate comes out to be 2.46 times greater than that of the United States, and Brazil\u2019s murder rate comes out to be 4.90 times larger than that of the United States.\nLott mentioned Chile in his op-ed in the Daily News. That country\u2019s murder rate is 4.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, which is actually less than the rate of the United States.\nOther sources largely support the OECD research, and Lott\u2019s use of the numbers. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s study, in 2011 the United States had a homicide rate of 4.7 murders per 100,000 people, Russia\u2019s murder rate was 9.6 per 100,000 people and Brazil\u2019s rate was 23.4.\nAccording to this data, Russia\u2019s murder rate was 2.04 times higher than that of the United States, and Brazil\u2019s was 4.97 times greater. That\u2019s close to what Lott said.\nDeveloped or Developing?\nNow comes the trickier part of Lott\u2019s claim.\nLott was reacting to Obama\u2019s use of the word \"advanced\" to describe a group of countries, and saying Obama was providing false information. Lott described a group of counties with the word \"developed\" and included Brazil and Russia.\nThose words are important, and whether you consider Brazil or Russia advanced and\/or developed makes all the difference.\nThe OECD is currently comprised of 34 member countries and lists Brazil and Russia as \"key partners.\"\nBut just because the OECD includes these 36 countries when compiling its Better Life Index does not mean that they are all automatically classified as developed nations.\nThe OECD\u2019s member countries \"include many of the world\u2019s most advanced countries but also emerging countries like Mexico, Chile and Turkey.\"\nPunditFact reached out to OECD\u2019s Better Life Index to inquire what criteria was used to distinguish between \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 countries, but did not hear back.\nHowever, other experts shed some light on the issue.\nAccording to Massimo Morelli, Columbia University professor of political science and economics, Brazil and Russia are considered intermediate countries. They are not \"developing\"\u00a0nations, but not quite considered \"advanced\/developed,\" either.\n\"The so-called BRIC countries \u00a0(Brazil, Russia, India and China) are those who moved from developing to developed very fast due to fast growth rates, but they are definitely not advanced yet,\" Morelli said.\nHowever, he did note that out of the four intermediate countries, both Russia and China may be considered advanced in some respects.\nLeonid Peisakhin, assistant professor of politics at New York University in Abu Dhabi, agreed.\n\"There is no hard definition for what an advanced country is. There are different markers having to do with human development levels, levels of industrialization, income per capita, size of the services sector, etc. Russia is a tricky case, as it is, in fact, highly industrialized; however, Russia does not have very high income or human development levels. Brazil is less ambiguously a developing economy,\" he said.\nHowever, even some of these factors are not always clear cut.\n\"If you define \u2018advanced\u2019 countries based on something simple such as per capita real GDP, I think that you are going to have a hard time including countries such as Chile, Poland, Greece, Portugal, and many others, but not include Russia,\" Lott said in a follow-up statement to PunditFact.\nThe World Bank uses GNI (Gross National Income), and not GDP, as its prime indicator. (The total national income is divided by the population of the country to determine the GNI per capita.)\nIn 2013, Brazil\u2019s GNI per capita was $11,690. Russia\u2019s was $13,850.\nUsing the World Bank\u00a0definition, Brazil is classified as having an upper-middle-income economy, which places it under the category of a developing nation.\nRussia is ranked as a high-income nation, and is not labeled as \"developing.\"\nFor comparison the U.S. GNI in 2013 was $53,470.\nMeanwhile, the World Trade Organization allows members to decide for themselves how to classify themselves, although other member countries can dispute the decision.\n\"Setting aside these ambiguities, there can be no doubt that the U.S. should be compared to other countries with similar levels of income and development and a similar historical trajectory: Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. These are all highly advanced and developed economies with similar historical trajectories and consequently functional rule of law systems,\" said Peisakhin.\nOne final note: Out of the nations observed, the United States\u2019 murder rate was only exceeded by three countries in the study: Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. (Mexico is considered emerging or developing by most organizations, including OECD.)"}

It did not ban all guns. The number of civilian-owned guns is now nearly the same as before the 1996 law, although the rate of ownership is less.\nIn Venezuela, the government instituted measures to try to limit the flow of guns to civilians. But experts said most guns are sold on the black market and that guns remain rampant in Venezuela. The idea that private gun owners could successfully challenge a national military is also unlikely.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.","full_article":"U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparred with Fox News\u2019 Jeanine Pirro about how to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.\n\"I\u2019m here in Australia, congressman. They don\u2019t have problems like this,\" Pirro said Aug. 10 following the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton that killed 31 people. \"This is starting to be unfortunately a uniquely American situation. And I am a gun owner. I am a strong Second Amendment person, but some of the wrong people are getting their hands on guns.\"\nGaetz replied: \"Nobody would suggest that in the United States we would want Australia\u2019s solution. There they went and confiscated all the guns. You know who did what Australia did? Venezuela. And now their people can't fight back when they are having to fight their way out of a socialist dictator.\"\nBut no one suggested taking away guns, Pirro responded, adding the Gaetz\u2019s Venezuela comparison seemed \"a little off.\"\nSo PolitiFact Florida wanted to look into it. The general point Gaetz was trying to make, his spokesman told us, was that he believes gun control failed in both Australia and Venezuela. He shared articles showing an Australian black market for guns, for example, as well as other news stories about Venezuela\u2019s gun control laws leaving civilians and even police more vulnerable.\nBut there are several factual inaccuracies with his specific claim about Australia and the comparison to Venezuela.\n\u2022 Australia didn\u2019t enact a total gun ban; it banned certain guns, including semi-automatics after a mass shooting in 1996.\n\u2022 That\u2019s different from what Venezuela\u2019s government did in 2012 and 2013, when it took steps in an effort to stem\u00a0the flow of guns.\n\u2022 In both countries, millions of guns remain in civilian hands. Gun deaths are a major problem in Venezuela.\nGun control in Australia\nIn 1996, a shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. It was one of the most deadly civilian mass shootings in the world at the time. The conservative-led national government moved quickly to ban and destroy certain guns.\nAustralia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms. After that, people possessing the weapons would be subject to strict penalties. The buyback program took in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the country\u2019s estimated guns.\nToday, Australians still legally own a high per-capita ratio of single-shot long guns, along with plenty of handguns, said Philip Alpers, founding director of Gunpolicy.org, a global project of the Sydney School of Public Health. But the number of legal and illegal guns dropped from about 3.2 million in 1996 to 2.5 million in 1997.\nSince then, it has climbed back up to almost the same number as before the ban, though the rate of gun ownership is smaller today.\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Australia suffered 14 mass shootings, which claimed 117 lives, Alpers said. Following the gun law changes, there were no mass shootings for many years. In June 2019, four people were killed by a gunman who used a banned gun. In 2018, seven were killed in a mass family homicide-suicide.\nGun control in Venezuela\nWhat Venezuela did several years ago was not the same as Australia.\nThe gun situation was not the same, for starters. In Australia, the government responded to a mass shooting. Venezuela faced a widespread problem with rampant gun violence and homicides \u2014 and it still does.\nIn 2012, Venezuela imposed measures to ban possession of a gun in public places and to halt private gun sales to citizens.\nIn 2013, President Nicolas Maduro signed a disarmament bill that was intended to stem the flow of guns.\nThe law created an automated system of registration for arms, parts, and ammunition under control of the armed forces. Individuals were allowed conditional possession, meaning that the state could take their gun.\nRebecca Hanson, an expert on crime in Venezuela and now a professor at the University of Florida, said she wouldn\u2019t call the 2013 law a \"gun ban,\" because civilians could still own guns as long as they registered them. Also, guns remained widely available on the black market and enforcement was lax.\n\"The law, in reality, did not affect people's ability to access guns in any effective or long-term way,\" she said.\nSince the majority of guns are purchased on the black market, regulating the legal market does little to reduce gun sales in Venezuela, she said. Many of these guns end up flowing from state security forces and the military into the black market.\n\"All of this is to say that even with the 2013 law, access to guns has increased,\" she said.\nAlejandro Velasco, New York University history professor of modern Latin America, told us that\u00a0\"the gun ban had almost no practical impact on people\u2019s ability to buy and keep (or use) weapons.\"\nThere are no solid numbers to pinpoint the number of guns in civilian ownership in Venezuela. Gunpolicy.org estimates that there were about 5.9 million privately owned guns in civilian hands in Venezuela\u00a0 as of 2017, though the consultant that came up with it said it could be a wide range.\nThe opposition movement has billed itself as nonviolent for the most part, Velasco said. Several experts told us it\u2019s not surprising that civilians don\u2019t bring guns to protests where they face the armed government.\n\"Even if the disarmament law had dramatically reduced gun ownership, which is not at all clear, armed anti-government civilians would stand no chance against the tanks and fighter jets of the army,\" said Dorothy Kronick, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist.\nExperts were critical of Gaetz using the problems in Venezuela to make any commentary on gun laws in the United States.\n\"Linking the issue of arms control with the struggle for democracy in the Venezuelan context only contributes to distort a situation that is already very distorted,\" Keymer Avila, a professor of criminology at the Central University of Venezuela said, \"increasing violence in an environment that is already very violent, and undermines an institution that is already very precarious.\""}

Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","full_article":"Deep in the May 2016 Texas Supreme Court ruling that upheld and critiqued the current school funding system is encouraging news about the performance of\u00a0Texas students.\nOn Page 58 of the majority opinion, Justice Don Willett (who subsequently showed up among individuals that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he\u2019d consider to succeed Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court) refers to a November 2005 decision by the court that required lawmakers to change the system.\nAt the time of the West Orange-Cove II ruling, Willett writes, \"the percentage of students meeting the college-readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013,\" Willett continues.\nDid Texas high\u00a0school graduates get so much more college-primed that fast?\nBest we could tell, the cited figures track with state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency. Then again, as few as 26 percent of Texas high-school graduates lately show a readiness for college according to a couple of other respected metrics.\nTexas Success Initiative\nWith help from Texas Education Agency officials, we found figures very close to what Willett presents in the 2016 majority opinion. According to the agency, in 2004, 29 percent of students fulfilled college readiness standards for English language arts and 43 percent did so for math while in 2013, 65 percent of students met readiness standards for English, 66 percent for math. With rare exception, according to the agency, the percentage of students fulfilling each readiness standard escalated steadily through the intervening years. And most recently, in 2014, 68 percent of students met the English readiness standards with 67 percent doing so in math, the agency says.\nWe wondered what the percentages meant. They reflect student test results, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised, in keeping with a state law that requires college and universities to assess incoming high school graduates for their readiness to take college courses and offer remedial instruction as needed.\nUnder the program, called the Texas Success Initiative, the TEA has reported on the readiness of high-school students by calculating the share of students who meet related expectations on the state-mandated English language arts and math 11th grade\/exit-level Texas Assessment of Knowledge & Skills.\nAsked if perhaps standards loosened between 2004 and 2013, Culbertson pointed out by email that in each of the years, a student classified as ready for college needed \"scale scores of 2200\" on each relevant TAKS including a 3 (out of a possible 4) on the writing portion of the English test.\nTo our inquiry, Shannon Housson, TEA director of performance reporting, said by phone the 124 percent and 54 percent respective improvements in students meeting the readiness standards over nine years reflected schools and students adjusting to and, in some cases, mastering the English and math TAKS, which were given from 2003 through 2011 before yielding to the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness.\nAt its inception, Housson said, the TAKS added up to a \"significant increase in rigor\" for students accustomed to the previous state-mandated exams. \"I remember the angst in the schools,\" Housson said, as teachers and others came to terms with the new focus on \"higher-order thinking skills\" linked to the state-set curriculum rather than simply academic skills.\nFinally, Willett\u2019s citation of the 2005 court decision on school finance led us to look back at how that opinion by Justice Nathan Hecht presented the percentages of students meeting the readiness standards. In the ruling, Hecht showed results for all students plus break-outs suggesting considerable performance lags among African American, Hispanic and Limited English Proficient students.\nResults for 2013 suggest such gaps have closed quite a bit except among students the state deems English Language Learners.\nTexas Students With Test Scores Suggesting College Readiness, 2004 and 2013\n*Limited English Proficient\/English Language Learners\nSAT, ACT scores\nThere are other ways to gauge college readiness.\nIn 2014, nearly 34 percent of the state\u2019s students who took the pre-college SAT (or 32 percent of public school students taking the test) did well enough to demonstrate a readiness for college work without remediation,\u00a0according to\u00a0the College Board, which associates an SAT score of 1550 out of 2400 with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first-year college GPA of B- or higher.\nThe same year, among 60 percent of 116,147 Texas high school graduates to take the ACT scored well enough to show a readiness for college English,\u00a0the Iowa-based group says, with 47 percent doing so in math and 36 percent demonstrating readiness in science--and only 26 percent clearing all the tests\u2019 college-readiness benchmarks. ACT says its readiness benchmarks are \"scores on the ACT subject-area tests that represent the level of achievement required for students to have a 50% chance of obtaining a B or higher or about a 75% chance of obtaining a C or higher in corresponding credit-bearing first-year college courses.\""}

Katsma has referenced the Rainy Day Fund in the context of a conversation about income tax cuts, the point he is making is that the state government can afford to cut taxes because the government still has money left over even after making a new deposit in our \u2018savings account,\u2019\" Krueger said.\nSo, Katsma\u2019s numbers add up.\nBut in his claim is he offering the full picture?\nRainy Day Funds across the country\nIn 2017, state rainy day funds were at their highest overall level in almost 20 years, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers, with a tally of $54.7 billion for all 50 states.\nSounds like a lot.\nBut Pew Charitable Trusts reports that the $54.7 billion would only cover a median of 20.5 days, or 5.6 percent of general fund spending.\nIn 2017, Alaska, Wyoming and Texas were in the lead for how many days they could cover with a rainy day fund -- Alaska would be able to fund 376.6 days, Wyoming 366.9 days, Texas 70 days.\nThe four states coming at the bottom -- Montana, Kansas, Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- would be able to fund zero days relying on their rainy day funds.\nWisconsin fell on the lower end -- able to only fund six days using its rainy day fund.\nWith its total reserves, Wisconsin could fund up to 18.4 days. That compares to the national median of 30.3 days.\n\"A typical reason you would want to have a rainy day fund is a recession appears, you weren\u2019t expecting it, and so you need to make up the revenues because of the recession, but I don\u2019t think any states have enough revenue set aside so you can make up for the entire recession,\" Holcombe said.\nSo while Wisconsin\u2019s fund may be at its peak, the figure does not compare favorably with other states. That was missing from the claim."}

But it\u2019s not the only one, and independent analysts say it\u2019s far from a sure thing that Medicare for All would save as much money as Gillum hopes it will.\nThe statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.","full_article":"Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has attracted national attention for his support for \"Medicare for All,\" an idea to expand the government-run Medicare health insurance program to cover everyone, rather than just Americans 65 and over.\nUnder the plan Gillum supports, individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone\u2019s medical bills. It's based on a bill\u00a0sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union, host Dana Bash asked Gillum about a George Mason University study that found Medicare for All could cost the government $33 trillion over 10 years. Bash asked whether Gillum be willing to tell Floridians they need to pay more in taxes to offset the costs.\n\"Well, let me first say there was also a report, Dana, that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time,\" Gillum said during the Sept. 2, 2018 interview.\nWe confirmed with Gillum\u2019s campaign that he and Bash were actually referring to the same report \u2014 one published by the free-market-oriented Mercatus Center at George Mason University.\nBoth sides in the Medicare for All debate have seized upon aspects of the report to bolster their arguments.\nCritics, including the author of the report, emphasized that the policy would bring a substantial fiscal burden. But supporters found fiscal hope. When Sanders previously\u00a0said\u00a0that the study indicated that enacting Medicare for All \"would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period,\" we rated that claim Half True.\nWe thought that the issue was worth a fresh look with Gillum's defense, especially given some slight differences in his phrasing.\nThe Mercatus study\nMedicare for All supporters say the proposal would not only increase health-insurance coverage to 100 percent but that the government could actually save money. The savings, they say, would come from eliminating the profits currently generated by health insurers, from\u00a0taking advantage of economies of scale, and from being able to leverage lower prices on everything from prescription drugs to physician reimbursement fees.\nCritics are skeptical that such savings would materialize, leaving taxpayers on the hook if they don't. They also worry about other\u00a0negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees.\nTo settle this debate, Medicare for All supporters flip\u00a0to the page in the Mercatus report summarizing the financial effects of Sanders\u2019 bill.\nThe researchers looked at two main scenarios after implementation of the proposal.\nOne compared Mercatus\u2019 projection for the Sanders Medicare for All bill with what would be expected under a continuation of the current system (according to a Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 projection). With Medicare for All, the total amount of health care expenditures nationally would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years compared to the current system.\nSo Gillum can point to some evidence in the study that predicts\u00a0savings. However, the Mercatus report\u2019s author, Charles Blahous, criticized that takeaway.\nIn an August interview with PolitiFact, Blahous said that estimate is based on a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders\u2019 plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payments will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent.\nBlahous was more confident about an alternative scenario published in the report, in which cost-control works less effectively. Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law.\nIn addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem.\nThe role of uncertainty\nIn other words, there are a range of possible outcomes if Medicare for All is enacted, some supportive of Gillum\u2019s perspective and some not.\nIndependent health policy experts express caution before assuming large savings.\nSustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model that Gillum likes are \"not likely feasible,\" John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute, told us in August. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it\u2019s a \"pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically.\"\nChristine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said that uncertainty makes it hard to predict the cost impact of Medicare for All, including whether administrative costs and reimbursements would decline or whether demand for health care services could be kept in check.\nIn a recent report co-authored by Eibner that considered the impact of a single-payer model for New York state, RAND found that \"the estimated effects are highly dependent on the assumptions about provider payment rates, administrative costs, and drug prices.\""}

The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator, who ruled the teacher had been fired improperly and gave the teacher back his job. And two courts upheld the arbitrator\u2019s decision.\nThe importance of the endangering standard was underlined by the fact that the Legislature later made sure to take that clause out.\nThe attack on Evers is partially accurate, but leaves out important details  \u2014 our definition of Half True.","full_article":"With the Aug. 14, 2018 primary election closing in, the Wisconsin Republican Party on Aug. 1, 2018 released radio ads attacking four of the eight Democrats who are running for governor.\nIn announcing the ads, the party identified Tony Evers, Matt Flynn, Mahlon Mitchell and Kelda Roys as the leading candidates to win the right to challenge GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018.\nThe ad attacking Evers, who is the state schools superintendent, claims Evers \"didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls.\"\nAn earlier version of the GOP attack, which we fact checked in 2017, rated Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.\nThe revised attack does a little better, but still leaves out important context.\nThe teacher\nThe radio ad alludes to the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. As we reported in the earlier fact check, Harris was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker.\nAs the state GOP continued to hammer on the case in 2017, it was later reported that a fellow staff member had told the school district\u2019s investigators Harris also had made crude remarks to staffers about the appearances and chest sizes of female students. However, Evers\u2019 department said neither the department nor the arbitrator could determine whether Harris actually made the sexually crude comments.\nHarris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. The arbitrator concluded that Harris\u2019 behavior did not endanger any students \u00a0\u2014 a key finding, based on state law at the time \u2014 and the decision to give Harris back his job was upheld by two courts.\nThe real punch in the Republican Party\u2019s attack, though, is aimed at Evers. So, where does he come in?\nEvers\u2019 role\nEvers did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged.\nBut Evers decided against seeking revocation after concluding, as the arbitrator did, that the teacher\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t endanger kids, as defined by the law at that time.\nIn other words, in the view of Evers\u2019 department, there was no legal basis to take away Harris\u2019 license.\n\nAt the time, state law defined immoral conduct in such cases as \"conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil.\"\nAfter the Harris case, the law was changed so that immoral conduct includes \"the intentional use of an educational agency\u2019s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material.\"\nThat is, the part about endangering students was removed, a change that was backed by both Evers and Walker."}

We emailed the White House to point us to the poll Trump relied on. We did not hear back.\nLooking at support among Republican voters, Trump\u2019s highest number in the latest polls is 87% from Gallup. CNN comes in second at 86%. The other four are lower.\nAll polls are based on surveys done at the end of May. No margin of error, among the polls that provide them, would be large enough to deliver the 94% that Trump claimed.\nSetting no records\nTrump\u2019s approval among Republicans has generally held in the mid-to-high 80s, which would qualify as robust. Gallup clocked in a slightly higher number of 90% in March and April. That sort of shift is within the normal variation in polling.\nWe checked out whether Trump\u2019s Republican approval was at an all-time high, both at this point in comparable tenures or all-time, as he said.\nAt this point in his administration (around the 860-day mark), Trump\u2019s approval comes in a bit behind George W. Bush, who held a 94% approval rating within his party, as did his father George H.W. Bush. Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon brought up the rear, getting the nod from just 79% of Republican voters in May of their third year in office. Here\u2019s the full picture, going back to Dwight Eisenhower.\nTrump once claimed that he had the highest polling numbers \"in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.\" We rated that False. Not only have other presidents in the recent past enjoyed higher numbers, but there is no data from Lincoln\u2019s time. That is pure invention.\nFor real record-setting, look to George W. Bush who, according to Gallup, won approval from 99% of Republicans in the month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks."}

The biggest divergence was in the first of these claims, in which McMurray was referring to people who own assault weapons rather than gun owners more generally.\nThe statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.","full_article":"Republican Chris Jacobs and Democrat Nate McMurray are facing off in a June 23 special election for a congressional seat in western New York, and may also face each other in the regular election in November. Their June 13 debate got heated.\nIn the debate, Jacobs, a state senator, brought attention to past tweets by McMuray, his rival to fill the 27th district vacancy created when Republican Rep. Chris Collins stepped down earlier this year.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of three assertions by Jacobs, with an analysis of their accuracy.\nJacobs\u2019 first claim\nJacobs said, \"Nate tweeted, \u2018Gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth.\u2019\"\nDuring the debate, McMurray countered that Jacobs \"is literally making stuff up.\"\nBoth sides have a point. McMurray did tweet about \"the most insecure and dangerous club\" last year, but Jacobs suggested that McMurray had targeted a broader group of gun owners for that description.\nJacobs was referring to an Aug. 3, 2019, tweet in which McMurray said, \"YOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world.\"\nKate Walker McArdle, McMurray\u2019s communication director, said Jacobs had unfairly conflated \"gun owners\" with \"assault rifle\" owners.\nMcMurray \"specifically referenced assault-style weapons in his tweet,\" she said. \"While Nate is a gun owner, he was also conveying the fact that owning an assault rifle doesn't make one a \u2018man.\u2019\u00a0 His vision for America does not include assault weapons.\"\nJacobs\u2019 second claim\nSoon after, Jacobs said that McMurray had \"said the NRA are homegrown terrorists.\" (The NRA is the National Rifle Association, a prominent pro-gun group.)\nHere too, Jacobs has a point, though he oversimplifies a bit.\nOn March 8, 2018, McMurray tweeted a response to a video advertisement from NRATV, an NRA affiliate, that featured conservative commentator Dana Loesch holding a large hourglass.\nIn his tweeted response, McMurray wrote, \"If ISIS made a video as threatening as the NRA\u2019s hourglass offering, we would all be legitimately freaked out. Who is behind this \u2018genius\u2019 marketing? Are they channeling Margaret Hamilton in the Wizard of Oz? Yikes. #HomeGrownTerrorism\"\nSo McMurray did not outright call the NRA \"homegrown terrorists,\" his use of the hashtag above essentially aligns with Jacobs\u2019 claim.\nWalker McArdle told PolitiFact, \"This tweet was calling out the NRA for their scare tactics and videos that were highly scrutinized for threatening violence against Americans and journalists. (McMurray) did not say, \u2018the NRA is a terrorist organization.\u2019\"\nJacobs\u2019 third claim\nJacobs pulled a third claim from McMurray\u2019s Twitter feed before the end of the night.\nJacobs said, \"I am pro-life; (McMurray) is pro-abortion. He said abortion opponents are the American Taliban. That\u2019s another tweet of Nate McMurray.\"\nMcMurray has in fact referenced the \"Taliban\" or the \"American Taliban\" in tweets about abortion before.\nOn July 3, 2018, McMurray tweeted, \"DO THE MATH: 67% of the public is pro choice according to recent polls. Only 2 Republican members of Congress are pro-choice. 1 President actually said he wants to PUNISH women for abortion. Forget Democracy, forget mental health, act like the Taliban and PUNISH women. OR VOTE!\"\nWe found two other tweets in which McMurray does use the exact phrase, \"American Taliban.\"\nWalker McArdle countered, \"Nate did not use the phrase \u2018American Taliban.\u2019 Just as the phrase \u2018act like spoiled children\u2019 do(es) not literally mean that the person is a spoiled child, \u2018act like the Taliban\u2019 doesn\u2019t literally suggest someone is a member of the Taliban. But if the accusation is that Nate does not believe women should be punished for getting an abortion, that is correct.\"\nJacobs\u2019 campaign team did not provide any further information or context for what Jacobs said during the debate."}

That means no guns in America\u2019s schools. Period.\"\nThe quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierre\u2019s words out of context.\nHis full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school.\nIn 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRA\u2019s agenda.\nThe Everytown tweet has a measure of truth, but it leaves out important context that changes the meaning behind LaPierre\u2019s words.\nWe rate this claim Half True.","full_article":"Just about a week after the deadly shooting at a Florida high school, the National Rifle Association\u2019s vice president Wayne LaPierre delivered the group\u2019s response: more armed guards in schools.\n\"Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians \u2014 they are all more protected than our children at school,\" Lapierre said at the Conservative Political Action Committee Feb. 22. \"To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun.\"\nLaPierre had barely stepped down from the stage when the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted this blast from LaPierre\u2019s past.\nThe group quoted LaPierre as saying in 1999, \"We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools.That means no guns in America\u2019s schools. Period.\"\nThere are a few angles to consider here.\nDid LaPierre say those words?\nYes, he did. It was May 1, 1999, 10 days after two teenage boys killed 13 people, wounded more than 20 others and then committed suicide at Columbine High School in Colorado. LaPierre spoke at the NRA\u2019s annual convention and called for a policy banning guns from school.\nBut LaPierre said more than what the Everytown group quoted.\nHe was talking about guns brought to school by students, not teachers or trained security.\n\"Of the 6,000 young people the president acknowledges were caught with a gun at school during the past two years, we believe all of them should have been prosecuted,\" LaPierre said. \"But the truth is only five were prosecuted in 1997. And just eight were prosecuted in 1988. That's not zero tolerance.\"\nLaPierre made a passing reference to armed guards in schools, referring to \"the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel.\" As for arming teachers, something President Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in, LaPierre said nothing.\nIn his 1999 speech, his emphasis was on what adults should do to keep weapons out of the hands of teens. LaPierre said the NRA held adults responsible.\n\"Just as every kid should have a guardian who knows where he is and keeps him safe, every firearm should have a guardian who knows where it is and keeps it safely stored,\" LaPierre said.\nThe debate has shifted\nColumbine horrified the nation in its scale and the cold-blooded method of the high school seniors who had spent a year planning their attack. The Senate passed a bill to strengthen background checks, but it died in the House. The slaughter prompted more discussion of early identification of loners, and more emphasis on school security. Keeping weapons out of the hands of minors gained more attention.\nThe 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 26 elementary students and one of their teachers was the signature event when LaPierre spoke forcefully about a good guy with a gun being the best response to a bad guy with a gun.\nHis rhetoric in 2012 was the same as when he spoke in 2018.\n\"American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security,\" LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21, 2012. \"Yet, when it comes to our most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family, our children, we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless.\"\nIn 2012, LaPierre called on Congress to immediately \"appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation.\""}

But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it.\"\nThere\u2019s no question that Cortez Masto opposes the ESA program. But the ad exaggerates the size and scope of the program itself. Only a fraction of the state's 450,000 students have actually applied to be part of the program. The ad also accurately cites polls showing Hispanic support for the program, though recent polls show more modest support.\nBecause this ad is accurate but needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/736fb02e-95c9-43ad-a5ea-ec50d5c4839b","full_article":"The conservative-leaning LIBRE Initiative is using a new school choice program as political ammunition in Nevada\u2019s competitive U.S. Senate race.\nThe grassroots nonprofit, which has financial ties to the billionaire Koch brothers, released a digital ad in English and Spanish on Sept. 13 accusing Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto of opposing an educational program favored by Hispanics.\n\"Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools,\" the ad says. \"But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it.\"\nThe second part of the claim is not in dispute, as Cortez Masto clearly came out in opposition to the program in August, saying it diverts money from public schools.\nBut the ad overstates the Latino support and the number of people who are set to benefit from the ESA program, which has been tied up in lawsuits almost immediately after being passed.\nESA 411\nNevada lawmakers approved a bevy of new educational programs in 2015, but one of the most controversial has been the Education Savings Account program.\nApproved by Republican lawmakers on a party-line vote, the bill creates a program allowing parents to pull their children out of public schools and receive roughly $5,100 (about 90 percent of yearly per-pupil funding) a year to be used for private education expenses \u2014 private school tuition, textbooks, transportation, etc.\nIt\u2019s similar to a school voucher system, but program backers say the key difference is that the money is distributed through \"education savings accounts,\" state-run accounts that reimburse parents for approved educational expenses.\nOther states have created similar programs, but Nevada is unique in that all parents can apply for the program regardless of income or any other factor.\nSeveral groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Nevada branch, sued before the program could be implemented and successfully had a legal hold placed on the program. The state\u2019s Supreme Court heard arguments on the program in late July, and both sides are still awaiting for a ruling from the court.\nTotal enrollment\nConstant litigation hasn\u2019t stopped the program from turning into political ad material.\nThe ad text claims that \"more than 450,000 students to benefit from school choice,\" citing a 2015 Lincoln County Register editorial.\nThat\u2019s the total number of students in Nevada (now closer to 467,000), but isn\u2019t anywhere close to the actual number of program applicants, which numbers around 7,800 at the most recent count.\nThe program is open to all students, but it is misleading to say that all of them will \"benefit\" from the program when the number of applicants is so small.\nLIBRE Initiative spokesman Wadi Gaitan said in an email that continuing legal uncertainty over the program means that the number of applicants is an \"incomplete\" barometer of who the program is helping, as presumably some parents are waiting for the dust to settle before deciding to enroll in the program.\nThe ad\u2019s vocal track differs from the text overlay as well, saying the program would help \"more than 450,000 students access better schools.\"\nAgain, there are no barriers for parents to apply for the program, but it\u2019s a bit far-fetched to assume that it will give literally every student in the state access to the school of their choosing given that tuition alone tends to cost more than the projected ESA stipend.\nAverage private school tuition in Las Vegas ranges from $8,700 to $9,600 a year, according to information from privateschoolreview.com. Demographic data released on program applicants shows that the majority of parents applying live in ZIP codes with higher-than-normal average household incomes (though income levels of applicants aren\u2019t disclosed).\nThe ad also cites a 2015 poll funded by the American Federation for Children, a conservative-leaning nonprofit that champions \"school choice.\" The group found that 71 percent of Nevada Hispanics polled favored the program.\nMore recent polling found that the program is still supported by voters, though not as strongly as the earlier poll suggests. A KTNV-TV 13 Action News\/Rasmussen Reports poll from August found that Hispanic voters polled supported the program on a 47 to 35 percent basis, with 17 percent undecided."}

The event was part of a national wave of marches leading up to the national Second Amendment March in Washington in April 2010.\nKucinich\u2019s campaign website linked to a YouTube video clip posted by Progress Ohio, a liberal group, showing about 10 minutes of the April 10, 2010, rally.\nThe clip starts with Dan White, who was active with Ohioans for Concealed Carry, saying: \"I\u2019m not lying, if it wasn\u2019t for them I don\u2019t think we would be on the square right now today.

I\u2019m pleased to be here today at this Second Amendment rally.\"\nMonths later while speaking at an Ohioans for Concealed Carry rally in August 2010, Cordray recounted the difficulties in pulling off the April rally.\nThe Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board was \"very unhappy and resistant\" about the planned rally, Cordray said.\n\"In the end, after having no real leg to stand on and denying a permit, they decided at the last minute they were going to require some giant insurance policy to have to be obtained for people to be able to have a rally on the statehouse grounds,\" Cordray said.\nCordray said he spoke with board chair Richard Finan and asked, \"Look, you don\u2019t require this of other groups, why would you be requiring this here?\"\nAccording to Cordray, Finan then asked, \"Are you willing to take responsibility?\"\n\"And I said, yes, I am willing to take responsibility,\" Cordray told the group.\nFinan, who has since retired from the board, told PolitiFact that he recalled Cordray reaching out to him before the rally.\n\"He told us we could go ahead and allow the rally to occur on the statehouse grounds,\" Finan said.\nConcealed Carry group exchanged letters with state board\nWe sought records from the board related to the 2010 rally, but a spokesman told us that it only keeps records for four years.\nHowever, Jeff Garvas, who organized the 2010 rally and is the president of Ohioans for Concealed Carry, shared with PolitiFact some of his correspondence with the board.\nGarvas told PolitiFact that his group obtained a permit from the advisory board about eight months before the event. Then, about two weeks before the rally, he said the board told the group that it had to pay for 10 state troopers and promise that no one would show up with a firearm. At some point, the board also told the group that it would have to obtain a half-million dollar insurance policy, he said. (Its special events policy states that the board may require the permit holder to file a certificate of insurance at least seven days prior to the event.)\nGarvas sent the board\u2019s executive director, William Carleton, a letter raising objections to the firearm ban at the rally.\nCarleton wrote in an April 10 letter that Garvas had also verbally sought a waiver for the bond requirement and proof of insurance.\nCarleton granted the waiver as long as the group met certain conditions including holstering firearms and paying $1,000 for five state troopers. Carleton waived the requirement for a bond and proof of insurance.\nCarleton\u2019s letter doesn\u2019t mention Cordray, but an assistant attorney general was copied on the letter.\nCordray\u2019s spokesman Mike Gwin didn\u2019t dispute Kucinich\u2019s statement.\nGwin said that the Attorney General\u2019s office \"provided legal advice during the course of the permitting process that denying this group a rally permit would likely result in a costly and successful lawsuit by the protest organizers, as had happened with similar denied permits for statehouse rallies in the past.\""}

We decided to check whether there currently are immigration policies in Congress similar to Trump\u2019s proposals.\nTrump\u2019s immigration policies\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised to build a wall to stop illegal immigration and to be tough on people who violated immigration laws. While he was inconsistent about his plans for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, he was firm on deporting criminals. Trump also said he would limit legal immigration because \"immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening.\"\nTrump repeatedly criticized his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, for wanting to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States from Syria, a country afflicted by terrorism.\n\"When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats,\" Trump said June 13, 2016.\nIn December 2015, Trump called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" That comment came after a deadly attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\nIn his 10-point immigration plan, Trump said he would \"suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.\"\nCongress policies\nWe reached out to the Republican National Committee, chaired by Priebus, to find out which congressional policies specifically mirror Trump\u2019s immigration proposals. We did not get a response from the committee or from the House Republican Conference. So we did some digging on our own.\nA bill called the American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced in the House a year ago, calling for additional screening of \"covered aliens,\" to ensure they are not a threat to national security.\nThe bill defines a \"covered alien\" as a person applying for admission as a refugee and who is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria; has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria; or has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011.\nIndividuals cannot be admitted as refugees until the FBI director certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the National Intelligence director that background investigations sufficiently determined they are not a threat to national security, the bill said.\nA refugee may also only be admitted after the Secretary of Homeland Security -- in unanimous agreement with the directors of the FBI and National Intelligence -- certifies to 12 \"appropriate Congressional Committees\" that the person is not a national security threat.\nThe American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by 102 Republicans and one Democrat. It passed the House Nov. 19, 2015, with a 289-137 vote and stalled in the Senate in January.\nAnother House bill, Give States a Chance Act of 2015, was introduced November 2015 to allow governors to refuse the placement of Syrian refugees in their respective states if they certify they are \"not reasonably satisfied\" that the refugee does not pose a security threat.\nUnder that bill, the governor could also refuse a refugee if he or she \"has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee\" and if the governor determines that the proposed resettlement location \"is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants\" in the area is too high.\nThirteen Republicans co-sponsored the bill introduced by Rep. Ted S. Yoho, R-Fla. It\u2019s been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.\nThis summer, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) also introduced in the House the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act of 2016, to \"suspend, and subsequently terminate, the admission of certain refugees.\"\nThe bill is directed to nationals of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; or people who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in those specific countries.\nForty-nine Republicans co-sponsored the bill, which would also evaluate the costs of benefits provided to refugees and their impact on national security.\nBabin\u2019s bill to suspend admission of refugees sounds like what Priebus was talking about, said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies."}

But that report focused on a very different situation than what Walker\u2019s tweet described.\nSophie Delaunay, executive director of Doctors Without Borders, said the report was meant to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Central America and the resulting forced displacement \u2014 not the situation inside the United States or at the U.S. border with Mexico.\nThe report was based on medical data and a 2015 survey of 467 randomly sampled migrants who were receiving treatment at clinics in Mexico supported by Doctors Without Borders.\nAccording to the survey\u2019s findings, 68.3 percent of the migrants and refugees entering Mexico from the Northern Triangle said they had experienced violence during their transit through Mexico to the United States, and 31.4 percent of women said they had been sexually abused.\nWalker implied these numbers were \"the human toll caused by porous borders\" \u2013 that they were somehow the result of current immigration policies and could be fixed by a border wall. But they don\u2019t actually refer to the situation at the U.S. border at all.\nIn reality, the numbers chart the harms suffered by migrants on the journey through Mexico.\n\"Central American migrants are extremely vulnerable to violence, both in their home countries and along the route to the United States,\" Delaunay said. \"It is unfortunate that our data \u2014 that illustrated the dangers migrants face as they journey to the U.S. \u2014 are being used by the U.S. government to try to justify immigration policies that put the lives of these very same people at risk.\"\nIt\u2019s clear that Walker didn\u2019t pull the numbers out of thin air, but his claim is misleading.\n\"20k children were illegally smuggled last month\"\nMinor said this figure came from DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who presented it to House members during a briefing in January, referring to December data.\nFact-checkers at The Washington Post and FactCheck.org looked into the same claim after Trump made it a focal point of his prime-time Oval Office address on Jan. 8.\nDHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman told PolitiFact 19,313 minors tried to cross the border illegally in December, either with a parent or alone. Including others who arrived at legal ports of entry, a total of 22,110 minors showed up at the border without documents that month, she said.\nBut it\u2019s not accurate to describe either figure as the number of children being \"smuggled\" into the country, which Trump\u2019s supporters often link to drug cartels, \"coyotes\" or other bad actors.\nWhile there were about 20,000 minors stopped while trying to enter the United States illegally, the number of children smuggled to the border probably was much smaller. That\u2019s because border officials screen for false claims of parentage or guardianship.\nBetween April and September 2018, Customs and Border Patrol separated 170 family units on suspicion of smuggling after determining that the child was not related to the parent or guardian, according to The Washington Post.\nBut as FactCheck.org noted, 170 is a tiny percent of the more than 60,000 family units that were apprehended during that time frame. So it\u2019s far-fetched to suggest, as Walker did, that just about every minor caught at the border was brought there by a smuggler."}

His proposal would have allowed Congress to limit or withhold COVID-19-related emergency relief to K-12 schools that did not reopen for in-person learning after their teachers received vaccinations.\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the assistant majority leader, said Democrats voted against it because they objected to a punitive approach.\n\"This amendment would\u2019ve prohibited schools from getting critical resources to implement public health protocols,\" Murray\u2019s office said in a statement to PolitiFact Missouri.\n\"And as a result, this amendment would\u2019ve made it that much harder for schools to re-open for in-person instruction.

He, since, has\u00a0repeated\u00a0the assertion.\nThe American Rescue Plan increased the\u00a0Child Tax Credit\u00a0from $2,000 to $3,200 and $3,600 for children under six, or $300 a month. The plan also made more people eligible for the credit which increased the total granted to\u00a0$4,000 for one qualifying individual and $8,000 total for two or more.\nBiden\u2019s assertions, repeated by Sanders, are true in one regard: the projected poverty rate for 2021 would cut the rate by more than one-half. But we haven\u2019t been through the year to see whether or not the projection will be true.\nA U.S. Census Bureau report\u00a0released Sept. 14\u00a0showed the poverty rate for Americans under the age of 18 and younger was 16.1 percent in 2020. That is up from the Census Bureau report of 14.4 percent in poverty in 2019 but lower than any rate before 2019 since 16 percent in 1976.\nIn-depth reporting for the plan previously done by PolitiFact showed that the prediction was made using a\u00a0poverty reduction analysis report\u00a0by Columbia University on Jan. 14, 2021.\nThe Columbia report predicted that the number of people under the age of 18 living in poverty would decrease 51.1 percent because of several proposed policy elements including the expanded Child Tax Credit. The analysis did not account for other policy elements that would impact policy rates like an increased minimum wage, child care assistance and rental assistance.\nAccording to a July 28 report from\u00a0The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research\u00a0organization, the projected poverty rate for children in 2021 is 5.6%. Additionally, the report said that federal stimulus checks in general have a larger antipoverty impact than unemployment insurance or means-based benefits.\n\"If all other programs were in place but the stimulus checks had not been paid, we project 12.4 million more people would be in poverty in 2021,\" the report said.\nDuring the week of\u00a0March 14, 2020, the number of Iowa families who requested food and financial assistance increased by over 1,000 to 4,672. The same relative week a year before, 3,173 had sought the assistance. By the week of April 4, 2020, 7,342 families had requested assistance.\nAlex Carfrae, Iowa Department of Human Services\u2019 public information officer, said that, while the American Rescue Plan is providing direct financial relief to Iowa families, it is too early to know whether or not child poverty in Iowa has dropped since the plan became law.\nIn 2019,\u00a012.8% of children in Iowa\u00a0were experiencing poverty, That was down from 13.5% from the previous year.\nCarfrae said the Department of Human Services does not keep track of poverty numbers in the state but rather through program utilization.\n\"Many of the assistance programs that the DHS administers saw dramatic shifts in utilization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, making any analysis based on DHS programs or enrollment data challenging,\" Carfrae said."}

Working with a left-leaning County Board, typically there was a tug-of-war in which Walker tended toward lower property taxes and less spending, while the board would aim for more. Often there were Walker vetoes and veto overrides by the board.\nTo back Walker\u2019s claim, his staff pointed us to figures from the Milwaukee County budget archive.\nFor his first two budgets, for 2003 and 2004, Walker proposed a property tax levy lower than what the County Board had adopted the previous year. But for both budgets, the County Board adopted levies higher than what Walker proposed.\nUltimately, the levy rose in 2003 and dropped in 2004.\nThen a routine developed:\n1. Walker would propose for his new budget a levy that was the same amount as the previous year\u2019s levy.\n2. The County Board would override Walker vetoes and adopt a budget that included a levy higher than what Walker proposed.\n3. Walker would use that increased levy as his proposed levy for the next year\u2019s budget.\nFor example: Walker\u2019s proposed levy of $225.9 million for 2006 was exactly the same as the levy that the County Board had adopted for 2005.\nBut the levy that the board approved for 2006 was higher -- $232.6 million. And that was the levy Walker then made in his budget proposal for 2007.\nHere are the figures for the county budgets during Walker\u2019s tenure:\nAs we noted, Walker frequently used his veto in an attempt to freeze the property tax levy. For example, he vetoed all of the increase in tax levy spending that the County Board added in the 2011 budget. But the board overrode the vetoes."}

It highlighted several areas where Medicare Part D struggled in its implementation that sound extremely familiar.\nFor one thing, the Bush administration faced a difficult political battle to get the bill passed in 2003. That damaged public opinion of the law, making it a challenge to educate 43 million seniors on its nuances.\nEnrollment in the law was set to begin in late 2005. In April of that year, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that only 27 percent of respondents understood the law, while only 21 percent favored it. (In a comparable Kaiser poll in April 2013, 35 percent viewed the Affordable Care Act favorably and less than half felt they were well-informed of its details.)\nThe Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005, but it didn\u2019t\u00a0go live until weeks later in November. Even then, \"the tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing,\" the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0at the time.\n\"Visitors to the site could not access it for most of the first two hours. When it finally did come up around 5 p.m., it operated awfully slowly,\" the\u00a0Post\u00a0reported. (Sensing a pattern?)\nOnce seniors began to enroll, problems persisted. According to the report, the online tools had \"accuracy problems,\" and local organizations designated with assisting seniors \"reported problems getting necessary and accurate information.\" Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated \"the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided\" and \"service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information.\"\nThe Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act, noting that the country\u2019s experience with Medicare Part D suggested \"the experience will be far from perfect\" and \"problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked, but fixes were usually found.\"\nThese days,\u00a0nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it.\n\"There\u2019s really a striking amount of similarity even though this time it\u2019s a far larger and daunting task. It\u2019s a fair comparison,\" said Jack Hoadley at the Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute and one of the authors of the study. \"Once something works its way through the problems, you forget the problems.\"\nStill different\nBut there are important differences between Medicare Part D and the Affordable Care Act that make the challenges facing the exchanges different.\nBecause it was aimed at seniors and e-commerce was still relatively young, Medicare.gov was not intended to be the main hub for people to purchase and review plans, said David Brailer, the first National Coordinator for Health Information Technology under Bush.\n\"The issue with Medicare Part D is there were choices of 70 to 100 plans,\" Brailer said. \"People were overwhelmed with the choices, with the options available and didn't know how to navigate and pick one. I don\u2019t remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people. This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices.\"\nMeanwhile, most people who logged on to healthcare.gov in the opening weeks couldn\u2019t even get far enough to review what options were available.\nAlso, prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy-to-understand part of health care. Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated.\n\"For those who did choose to enroll (in Medicare Part D) online, they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used, and once you did, you got an estimated out-of-pocket cost to make your comparisons. In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy,\" Hoadley said. \"The drug cost is relatively predictable, certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs. The challenge for this website is a lot greater, probably by a significant amount of magnitude.\"\nAnd there\u2019s the political climate as well. When Medicare Part D passed, Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout. But even then, they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits.\nWhen Medicare Part D faced early troubles, many blue states came to its rescue.\nThe New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2006 that \"about 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program.\"\nBy contrast, not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act, and in the years since it passed, the party has made its repeal a top priority. In the states, many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces, putting greater pressure on the federal government.\nHenry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute, said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a \"two-front war\" Bush did not have to fight.\n\"On the one hand, one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem,\" he said. \"But you\u2019re also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics.\""}

He never got rich off of this deal because the case for eminent domain didn\u2019t pan out.\nBut that reading ignores another interpretation of Cruz\u2019s point: Trump certainly tried to take over the property before the state Superior Court stepped in and ruled in the woman\u2019s favor. Trump didn\u2019t mention the years-long legal battle onMeet the Press.\nFor glossing over some important context, we rate his claim Half True.","full_article":"Donald Trump\u2019s first words Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press were an attack on his biggest rival in the Iowa caucuses, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\nBefore bringing on Trump, host Chuck Todd showed a new Cruz ad criticizing the real estate tycoon\u2019s support for eminent domain, the government\u2019s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects. The ad quotes Trump as saying, \"I think eminent domain is wonderful.\"\n\"It made him rich \u2014 like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow for a limousine parking lot at his casino,\" the ad says.\nTrump launched into his critique right away.\n\"Good morning,\" said Trump in the clip, \"and I have to tell you his ad is wrong because I never knocked down that house. I wanted to get that house to build a major building that would have employed a tremendous numbers of people, but when the woman didn\u2019t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it. So he\u2019s got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down, it\u2019s false advertising.\"\nTodd said, \"Well, all right, the accusation was that that\u2019s what you wanted to do.\"\nTrump stood by his takedown: \"No, the accusation was that I did it, and I didn\u2019t do it.\"\nIt turns out that both Cruz and Trump are stretching the truth about what happened with a widow\u2019s home.\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll focus on Trump saying\u00a0Cruz has\u00a0\"got me bull-dozing down a house.\u00a0I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising.\"\nDonald vs. Vera\nIn a prior fact-check, we found Trump is sort of a poster boy for eminent domain (and he really did call the practice \"wonderful\" as recently as October.)\nEminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a government-run project. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the 2005 case Kelo vs. New London, Conn., said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The court decided the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area.\nCruz\u2019s ad references a period in the 1990s, prior to Kelo, when Trump wanted the state of New Jersey to use its eminent domain power to help him with a casino project. Trump planned to build a limousine garage to service the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City but several pieces of private property were in the way, including a home owned since the 1960s by a widow in her late 60s named Vera Coking.\nTrump has said he offered Coking millions for her property, but she wouldn\u2019t give up her home. In 1994, New Jersey\u2019s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened to use eminent domain to seize the house.\nThe dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government in 1998. After losing the case, Trump gave up his plan to buy Coking\u2019s house, telling the New York Daily News that he was \"no longer an interested buyer.\"\n\"The bottom line is it's too bad for Atlantic City, but it's not too bad for me because I'm not interested in the property,\" Trump said. \"Nobody gets under my skin.\"\nCoking\u2019s supporters painted Trump as a villainous fat cat. Coking herself called him \"a maggot, a cockroach and a crumb.\"\nTrump Plaza closed in September 2014 after struggling financially. Trump told the New York Times that ownership of Coking\u2019s property would not have saved it.\nBack to Cruz\u2019s ad, Trump has a point that it is misleading to imply he got \"rich\" after bulldozing an elderly widow\u2019s home, given that Coking kept her property, and Trump never got anything out of it. But Trump exaggerated \u00a0when he said \"when the woman didn\u2019t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it.\" It took several years of failed negotiations and losing a lawsuit for him to decide he was no longer interested."}

Those policies are sanctuary city policies and won\u2019t be tolerated in Texas. Elected officials and law enforcement agencies, they don\u2019t get to pick and choose which laws they will obey.\"\nThree days earlier, the referenced sheriff, Sally Hernandez,\u00a0issued a statement suggesting that while SB 4 wouldn\u2019t enhance public safety, she'd go along:\u00a0\"While I hate seeing a state law like this come to pass,\" Hernandez said,\u00a0\"I have always followed the law and that will not change.\"\nWe previously found False an Abbott claim that Hernandez was refusing to enforce a federal law regarding communication about jailed immigrants. The sheriff's published policy declares otherwise.\nStill, did Hernandez declare that she wouldn\u2019t detain known criminals accused of violent crimes, as Abbott said?\nAbbott offers no backup\nWe asked Abbott\u2019s office for the basis of his fresher claim and didn\u2019t hear back.\nYou could read the governor to have said that Hernandez, who was sworn in as sheriff in January 2017, put in place rules against keeping convicts accused of violent crimes behind bars \u2014 a broad unsupported charge given that the county continues to prosecute crimes of all kinds.\nBut in the context of Abbott's\u00a0mention of \"sanctuary city policies,\" he surely was referring to Hernandez\u2019s announced policy, effective Feb. 1, 2017,\u00a0that the county would no longer automatically grant requests by federal authorities to \"detain\" specified suspects for up to 48 hours so agents could investigate and possibly hasten deportation.\nHernandez,\u00a0in her January 2017 announcement of the policy,\u00a0said the department would honor ICE detainer requests only if an inmate was charged with or convicted of capital murder, murder, aggravated sexual assault or human smuggling \u2014 or if federal agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant for a suspect. Otherwise, inmates would be able to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status.\nHernandez said before the policy took effect: \"Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated.\"\nPolicy says\u2026\nLet\u2019s look at the wording of the policy, then gauge whether, as Abbott said, Hernandez was saying she wouldn\u2019t detain known criminals charged with violent acts.\nThe policy states the sheriff\u2019s office \"shall comply with ICE detainer requests under the following circumstances: (a) when the detainer request is accompanied by a judicial warrant or court order for continued detention or notification, to the extent required by the judicial warrant or court order; or (b) when the individual who is the subject of the ICE detainer is charged with or has been convicted of the following felonies under Texas law: (1) Capital Murder, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.03; (2) Murder -- First Degree, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.02; (3) Aggravated Sexual Assault, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 22.021, and (4) Continuous Smuggling of Persons, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 20.06.\"\nSeparately, we noticed, the policy leaves wiggle room for the sheriff to hold inmates facing other charges. A portion states the office \"reserves the right to exercise discretion in any individual case to ensure that justice is served.\"\nPolicy in practice\nWhen we asked the sheriff\u2019s office about Abbott\u2019s claim, spokeswoman Kristen Dark said by email that no inmates placed in the Travis County Jail \"will be released without making bond or having his or her charges disposed by a judge.\"\nAbbott\u2019s description of the sheriff\u2019s detainer policy, Dark wrote, wasn\u2019t accurate because the policy provides for detainers to be granted automatically for several violent crimes and also gives the office discretion to \"ensure that justice is served.\"\nDark wrote: \"In each and every case,\" the office\u2019s \"command staff reviews an inmate\u2019s current charge\/s as well as criminal history. If there is any indication of violence in that data, the ICE Detainer Request is honored,\" she said.\nA spreadsheet\nWe asked Dark if the agency had recently analyzed when jail personnel approved or rejected ICE detainer requests. In reply, Dark emailed us a spreadsheet, covering department decisions from March 1, 2017 through May 5, 2017, which she described as its May 5, 2017, response to an open-records request by KUT News.\nThe sheet doesn\u2019t show past convictions for any crimes, so we didn\u2019t see a way to reach conclusions about individuals not being detained despite their criminal histories.\nBut what about letting individuals go despite current violent-crime charges?\nOver the two-plus months, according to the sheet, ICE detainer requests were approved by the department for around 200 individuals charged with crimes, with many individuals listed as remaining in jail. Charges filed against the detainer-approved individuals include sexual abuse of a child; manslaughter; aggravated sexual assault; and driving while intoxicated, according to the sheet.\nThe sheet identifies 15 individuals already released to ICE in response to detainer requests. Related charges include DWI; assault causing bodily injury; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (two men); terroristic threat of a family member; manufacture of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver; possession of marijuana; burglary of a habitation; sexual indecency with a child; and aggravated sexual assault of a child.\nOn the flip side, the sheet lists about 90 individuals mostly released by the county after detainer requests were denied.\nMany of the people were arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated or possessing small amounts of marijuana, neither of which would necessarily signal a violent crime.\nWe counted nine individuals among the 90 who were each arrested for an alleged assault causing bodily injury to a family member--domestic violence, Dark told us by phone. Eight of these inmates were released on personal recognizance bonds, the sheet states, after the sheriff declined to approve a detainer requested by ICE; the ninth was released by a judge\u2019s order, the sheet says.\nWe asked Dark about the rationale for declining detainers on those individuals. By email, Dark replied: \"The nature of the behavior that resulted in the arrests was not aggravated and therefore, did not meet the threshold required for\" the office to automatically \"honor the ICE detainer request.\" Dark said by phone that further research revealed that five of the individuals had previously been released to ICE, possibly even deported.\nDark\u2019s email said: \"If ICE has past experience with the individuals, they should know the status and be able to quickly get a warrant or court order. If presented with a warrant,\" the sheriff\u2019s office \"would gladly have turned these inmates over to ICE upon the disposition of their charges by a judge,\" Dark said.\nThe sheet shows too that a man who allegedly made a terroristic threat was released on a personal recognizance bond after the sheriff denied a detainer request. Dark said by email the individual had allegedly told a security guard at a bar, \"I\u2019m going to shoot you.\" Dark said no weapon was found in his possession."}

Mark Pocan, D-Madison, who began by ripping into Walker\u2019s plan to make Wisconsin the first state in the nation to require needy but able-bodied adults to work and submit to drug tests to get Medicaid coverage.\nOn June 6, 2017, Walker\u2019s administration asked the federal government for permission to require the tests, which would apply to people seeking coverage through the state\u2019s BadgerCare program.\n\"Unemployment is low, and the percentage of people working in Wisconsin is among the best in the nation,\" Walker said in a statement at the time. \"This application is a step in the right direction, and we\u2019re continuing to build on Wisconsin\u2019s legacy as a leader in welfare reform.\"\nA few days later, on June 8, 2017, Pocan slammed the proposal as unoriginal during a radio \u00a0interview on \"The Thom Hartmann Program.\" He was responding to a caller -- Dave from Hoffman Estates, Ill.\n\"This is one we\u2019ve seen in other states,\" Pocan said. \"It just costs money. It hasn\u2019t been proven to find people who are using drugs who are getting the money. It\u2019s one of these demonizing tools of the poor again.\"\nThen his policy rip, turned into this riff:\n\"Trust me, Scott Walker has not had an original thought in his head for a long, long time,\" Pocan said. \"The most original thing he said recently is that he got his bald spot from hitting his head on a cabinet, and it\u2019s not a joke. He actually said his bald spot came because he hit his head on a cabinet.\"\nTo be sure, Pocan has less hair than Walker.\nBut is Pocan right?\nWhen asked for backup, Pocan spokesman David Kolovson cited a statement from a Oct. 18, 2014, Wisconsin State Journal article:\n\"The bald spot, (Walker) said, was the result of a repair incident in the kitchen when he banged his head on an open kitchen cabinet door while making repairs requested by his wife, Tonette.\"\nKolovson also cited a June 15, 2015, Washington Post article \u00a0that quoted Walker:\n\"And I wish I could grow a little bit more hair on my scar up there,\" he said, mentioning his bald spot, which he says is the result of having bumped his head while fixing a sink years ago and not natural aging.\nA similar statement showed up in a Sept. 4, 2015, article on BBCNews.com.\nCarolyn Jacob, a board certified dermatologist, said Walker\u2019s explanation is not outside the realm of the possible.\n\"It really depends on if he actually cut his scalp on the cabinet,\" said Jacob, a medical doctor and director of Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. \"A scar would form and would not grow hair.\"\n\"However,\" Jacob continued, \"if he suddenly developed a circular spot in the same area, it may be unrelated but coincidental. We often see alopecia areata (circle\/patches of hair loss) on patients, and no one knows why anyone gets it.\"\nAnother expert, Ronda Farah, a medical doctor and assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Minnesota, also spoke in general terms and not directly about Walker.

Records show a deduction in earnings during her tenure as a state lawmaker.\nFor these reasons, we rate Munger\u2019s claim Half True.","full_article":"As Illinois grapples with more than $111 billion in unfunded pension debt, Republican Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger has sought to tie her opponent, Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza, to the problems that have contributed to the state\u2019s pension crisis.\nDuring a Chicago Sun-Times editorial debate on Sept. 15, Munger said: \"My opponent\u2026 was on both the city of Chicago payroll and the state of Illinois payroll simultaneously, taking full salary, funding her full pension benefits both as a city worker and as a state worker for 10 years.\"\nMendoza fired back, saying the statement was Munger\u2019s \"latest false allegation\" and one that previously has been disproven.\nBut the Munger campaign since has doubled down on its \"double-dipping\" claim that Mendoza took two government salaries and paid into two public pension systems, and now is calling on the Chicago Democrat to forgo one of her pensions.\nWith Munger making Mendoza\u2019s pensions and city\/state salaries prominent issues in the comptroller race, we wanted to find out if her allegation of double-dipping is true.\nMendoza\u2019s pensions\nIn 1998, Mendoza began working for the Chicago Department of Planning and Development as a project coordinator. Two years later, she was elected to the General Assembly, where she served as a member of the Illinois House from 2001-2011, before winning the election for Chicago City Clerk in February 2011.\nTo support Munger\u2019s claim, Phillip Rodriguez, Munger\u2019s campaign manager, provided documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests that show Mendoza\u2019s pension contributions into the Municipal Employees\u2019 Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and the General Assembly Retirement System.\nAccording to these records, Mendoza contributed $66,035 into the state pension fund and $34,943 into the city pension fund between 2001 and 2010 -- the time she served as a state representative while also working for the city. As of Aug. 15, 2016, Mendoza\u2019s contributions into the city pension fund totaled $101,736.\nMendoza contributed 9.5 percent of her lawmaker salary and 8.5 percent of her city salary, meeting employee contribution requirements for both retirement systems.\nIn 2010, Mendoza\u2019s legislative salary was $67,836 and her base city planner salary was $75,036, or a monthly rate of $6,253.\nDouble dipping?\nWhile Mendoza has acknowledged collecting paychecks from both the city and state and paying into the two public pension systems, she has produced documents that challenge the allegation she was double dipping on taxpayer-funded salaries.\nIn a Jan. 8, 2002,\u00a0memo to the planning department, Mendoza provided her legislative schedule and requested she not be paid by the city of Chicago on days the Illinois House was in session.\n\"As you are aware, it is extremely important that during the days that I am in session, I not be paid by the City as well,\" Mendoza wrote. \"It is of utmost importance to me that my records be perfectly clear regarding this matter.\"\nMendoza listed a total of 44 days between January and May 2002 to reflect her legislative schedule.\nThis 2002 memo is the only such documentation in which Mendoza explicitly asked not to be paid on days when the General Assembly was in session, but her pension contributions into MEABF also show hours were docked over her entire legislative tenure.\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to discern from the MEABF document exactly how many hours were docked, it does show deductions in both wage earnings and pension contributions during her entire time in the House.\nStacey Ruffolo, a spokesman for MEABF, noted unless requested, employees usually\u00a0have their hours docked for disciplinary reasons.\nIn defending her pensions during the editorial board debate, Mendoza said her city pension will be less because she wasn\u2019t paid for the days she was in session.\nMendoza also said she will fold her two pensions into one as GARS and MEABF are reciprocal retirement systems, though records show she has not yet applied for reciprocity.\n\"I also chose to not take the more lucrative pension that I could have taken when I was elected city clerk; I just went ahead and continued to be in the regular Municipal Employees\u2019 Annuity and Benefit Fund pension instead of the Cadillac plan pension,\" Mendoza said during the debate."}

Wisconsin is one of about a dozen states that authorizes cities to assess only property taxes \u2014 not sales or income taxes.\nBut his core statistical claim is wrong. Several other cities larger than 400,000 do not impose their own sales or income tax.\nWe define Half True this way: \"The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\"\nThat fits here.","full_article":"Citing stagnant revenue from the state and an increasing financial pinch, Milwaukee-area leaders are pushing the state to sign off on a 1% county sales tax.\nThe move, which could bring in as much as $160 million per year, would raise the sales tax in Milwaukee County to 6.5%. Officials want to introduce a binding referendum allowing residents to decide on the tax increase themselves, but in Wisconsin the Republican-controlled Legislature must also sign off on the plan.\nSo people like Milwaukee Mayor\u00a0Tom Barrett, a Democrat, must make the case to both voters and political opponents why this tax hike is needed. Here is what he said in doing so on\u00a0WISN-TV\u2019s \"UpFront.\"\n\"In many, many other states, you\u2019ve got different treatment for the largest metropolitan area,\" Barrett said in his Sept. 15, 2019 appearance. \"We are, the last time I checked, the only city in this country with a population of over 400,000 that doesn\u2019t have either a sales tax or a local income tax. We are just hamstrung because of the rules of the state.\"\nSo Barrett is making the general case that Milwaukee has less flexibility than its peers, while specifically claiming no other city of its size gets by without a local tax of some kind.\nWe\u2019ll examine both of those.\nIs Milwaukee uniquely limited?\nThe first element of Barrett\u2019s claim is that Milwaukee doesn\u2019t have the same options for raising tax revenue as other large cities.\nFor more than a century, Wisconsin has used state income and sales taxes to provide aid \u2014 called shared revenue \u2014 to local governments, while generally not allowing local governments to levy those taxes themselves, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research group. The main exception is a half-cent \"piggyback\" sales tax counties are allowed to levy on the same items taxed by the state. Other exceptions include stadium districts.\nThe\u00a0current sales tax throughout Milwaukee County is 5.6%, which includes a 5% state sales tax, a 0.5% county sales tax (since 1991) and a 0.1% stadium tax for Miller Park (since 1996). The stadium tax is expected to end by next year.\nMany other states don\u2019t have such an oversight requirement, giving local government the freedom to make independent decisions on tax increases.\nSome examples:\nIn Hillsborough County, Florida, which includes Tampa,\u00a0voters passed two referendums in late 2018 that raised sales taxes by 1.5 cents on the dollar for transportation and schools.\nThe Albuquerque City Council voted in 2018 to impose a\u00a0three-eighths cent tax, raising about $52 million per year.\nThe large Hennepin and Ramsey counties around the Twin Cities voted to\u00a0levy a half-cent sales tax for transportation in 2017, raising about $100 million annually between the two counties.\nBut not all states have such a system.\nThe Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation, reports 37 states allow local governments to impose their own general sales taxes.\nWisconsin is tricky to categorize.\nCounties may choose to adopt the 0.5% county sales tax, but not all of them do. The state Department of Revenue reports Manitowoc, Menominee, Outagamie, Racine, Waukesha and Winnebago counties have no county sales tax.\nThe Tax Policy Center lists Wisconsin among the states that allow local sales taxes. But a\u00a0\u00a02017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum (then the Public Policy Forum) listed Wisconsin among the states with no local sales tax power, since only counties have that ability and it\u2019s capped at 0.5%.\nThat policy forum report noted this has caused increasing problems in Milwaukee:\n\"Wisconsin\u2019s strong state aid historically has compensated for the lack of local revenue diversity. However, cutbacks in shared revenue have diminished this program\u2019s purchasing power and required Milwaukee to lean heavily on increased property taxes and fees to offset the impact.\"\nA 2019 policy forum report said stagnant shared revenue combined with state caps on property taxes has led to mounting questions about \"whether local officials can sustain appropriate service levels in areas such as public safety, streets, libraries\u00a0and parks.\"\nThe only large city without local sales or income tax?\nThis brings us to Barrett\u2019s more specific claim \u2014 that Milwaukee is the only city of 400,000 or more in the nation without a local sales or income tax.\nThe\u00a02017 report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum compared Milwaukee to 38 peer cities around the country. They reported 30 of those cities had a general local sales tax, and the remaining eight each drew revenue from a \"selective sales taxes and\/or other forms of taxation besides the property tax.\"\nThat report excluded cities like Indianapolis and Boston from the comparison since they have different funding mechanisms than Milwaukee. Indianapolis performs some typical county functions, and Boston has school district funds pass through its budget.\nWe asked Barrett\u2019s office for details on where his claim originated, and they forwarded us to Jeff Fleming, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Department of City Development. He said Barrett\u2019s claim was based on that policy forum report.\nBut Barrett referred to cities by size, not to the limited peer group in the study. And that makes a difference.\nBoston has a population well over 400,000 and does not have a local sales tax or income tax, according to an\u00a0August 2019 report from the Tax Foundation,\u00a0a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.\nWe\u2019ll assume Barrett was referring to cities that don\u2019t levy their own local sales tax, since otherwise Milwaukee wouldn\u2019t meet his criteria given that city residents are subject to the county\u2019s local sales tax.\nAnd in that case other cities join Boston on the list of exceptions to Barrett\u2019s claim.\nIndianapolis does not levy its own sales or income tax, but Marion County imposes a local income tax there,\u00a0according to the Tax Foundation. And Portland, Oregon, has no city-issued sales or income tax, but residents there pay an income tax to a regional transportation district."}

Roy Blunt has once again echoed his reasoning for supporting a repeal.\n\"This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges,\"\u00a0the Republican said in a Jan. 11 press release.\u00a0\"Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options.\"\nIt\u2019s not the first time Blunt\u00a0has mentioned the numbers, which his office noted were from\u00a0HealthCare.gov\u00a0(the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 website where individuals can enroll in health care).\nAs insurance providers pull out of markets and premiums rise around the country, the health care exchange is certainly facing substantial changes. Even in that context, though, Blunt\u2019s figures paint a drastic picture for Missourians, and we wanted to fact-check his statement.\n97 out of 114 counties\nOn the numbers, Blunt is correct. Ninety-seven Missouri counties will only have one insurance provider offering coverage on the health care exchange this year, according to data compiled and released by the official exchange provider,\u00a0HealthCare.gov, and synthesized by the\u00a0Missouri Hospital Association\u00a0and the\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation.\nFifteen counties and the city of St. Louis will have two providers, and two counties that include large swaths of Kansas City will have three.\nIn 2016, 112 Missouri counties and the city of St. Louis all had at least three insurance providers participating in the health care exchange. No county had only one.\nThe reduction in coverage is primarily the result of two major insurance providers exiting the individual state exchange at the beginning of the year. The providers, UnitedHealth Group and Aetna (known in Missouri as Coventry Health Care), are both staying in the state in other markets, but have opted out of participating in the exchange.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s impacting care as much as it\u2019s impacting the ability to choose the provider you want,\" said Dave Dillon, vice president of public and media relations at the Missouri Hospital Association.\u00a0In essence, he explained, it\u2019s possible for an individual not to have the option to choose a plan that would allow them to visit their regular doctor.\nWith this lack of choices, Dillon said, \"clearly the incentive between insurance companies to compete in cost just isn\u2019t there.\"\nDuring the open enrollment period, which ran from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31,\u00a0nearly 250,000 Missourians\u00a0enrolled in some form of insurance provided by the health care law.\nMetropolitan areas continue to have choice\nOne notable feature of Missouri\u2019s insurance exchange in 2017 is that all of the counties in the state\u2019s two metropolitan hubs, Kansas City and St. Louis, will continue to have more than one provider.\nAccording to the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau, of Missouri\u2019s roughly 6 million residents, about 63 percent live in the 17 counties and one city that will continue to have at least two provider choices.\nNationally, according to the\u00a0Kaiser Family Foundation, the trend is similar. Of exchange enrollees living in metropolitan areas, 62 percent will continue to have a choice of three or more providers while only 18 percent will have the option of only one provider.\nFor those living in rural areas, the numbers are almost reversed. Forty-one percent of those enrolled in the exchange living in rural areas will have only one provider option while 29 percent will have three or more options.\nThe out-of-pocket price\nIn addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent\" \u2014 is also statistically accurate, according to the Missouri Hospital Association and the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, it does not accurately portray the out-of-pocket price Missourians will face in 2017.\nWhile\u00a0premiums are on the rise in Missouri, as they are in the rest of the country, so, too, are the tax credits designed to offset the cost that the consumer bears.\nSpeaking\u00a0on the increases in price on the exchange this year, Dillon said, \"The individual was not exposed to the full cost of the increase of the sticker price.\" The rhetoric surrounding premium increases often looks only at the sticker price and not the out-of-pocket price, he said.\nAgain using data from\u00a0HealthCare.gov, the Missouri Hospital Association compiled the costs of premiums both before and after the tax credit in the 10 Missouri health insurance marketplace rating areas.\nLooking strictly at the second lowest-cost silver plan, which is the plan used by\u00a0HealthCare.gov\u00a0to determine the financial assistance an individual or family may receive, eight of the ten counties will see an out-of-pocket monthly price of $26.52. Data for the other two counties was unavailable.\nSo while premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan in each of the eight counties rose in 2017, the out-of-pocket cost saw a change of less than one percent \u2014 less than a dollar."}

John Kasich.\nIn a speech to the City Club of Cleveland Dec. 14, Cordray told the audience about his efforts to help consumers and fight big banks while serving as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nWhen an audience member asked Cordray to weigh in on the federal tax bill that was in the works at the time (it later became law), he said it wouldn\u2019t do enough to help the middle class.\n\"If you go back and look 50 years ago, individuals paid about 7 percent of the total and corporations paid 5 percent. Fast forward 50 years: individuals still 7 percent, corporations (are) down to 2 percent. And yet we are making (it) a priority to give more tax cuts to corporations. There\u2019s slabs for them, there\u2019s crumbs for people like the middle-class people in our society. I think it is wrong.\"\nCordray spokesman Mike Gwin told PolitiFact that Cordray was referring to corporate and individual income tax revenue as a share of U.S. gross domestic product, which wasn\u2019t fully clear from Corday\u2019s comments.\nWe fact-checked Cordray\u2019s historical comparison and found that he was in the ballpark, but his comment required further explanation about how businesses actually end up filing their taxes.\nIndividuals vs. corporations payment on taxes\nThe tax bill signed by President Donald Trump in December will significantly reduce the on-the-books corporate tax rate. The top corporate rate will fall from 35 percent to 21 percent, and the business version of the alternative minimum tax will be repealed.\nGwin cited a 2017 chart by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that shows tax receipts as a percentage of GDP dating back to 1934. The chart is based on historical tables from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\nGwin said Cordray\u2019s point wasn\u2019t to make comparisons between individual years such as 1967 and 2017 since the numbers fluctuate from year to year, but to make a larger point that over the last 50 years individuals have contributed an increasing share of overall tax revenue, while corporations have paid a decreasing share.\nSince Cordray mentioned looking back 50 years, we will use 1967 and 2017 as our comparison years, though it wouldn\u2019t change dramatically if we looked at different years in that general range.\nIn 1967, individual income taxes accounted for 7.3 percent of gross domestic product while corporate income taxes accounted for 4.1 percent. The center\u2019s estimate for 2017 shows that individual income taxes now represent a larger share -- 9.3 percent -- while the corporate share has fallen to 2.2 percent.\nJoel Slemrod, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, said the comparison is broadly accurate -- however, to get to the 5 percent for the corporate tax that Cordray cited would require going back a bit further than 50 years, to 1954. He also said that Cordray\u2019s numbers only apply to federal taxes.\nSince the United States has had a high corporate tax rate, millions of mid-sized businesses that would have paid the corporate tax have instead used alternative structures to lower their taxes.\nThat resulted in a huge amount of business income shifting from corporations to so-called pass-through entities, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\"If you look at data the past couple of decades there has been a huge rise in LLCs\" and other such entities, Edwards said. \"About half of all business income in the U.S. is those pass-through entities that don\u2019t pay the corporate income tax -- they pay through the individual income tax code.\"\nThe business-backed Tax Foundation compiled data showing the decrease in the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax and the increase in S corporations paying the individual income tax.\nBetween 1980 and 2012, the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax fell from 2.2 million to 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of S corporations subject to the individual income tax increased from 0.5 million to 4.2 million, with the number of non-corporate businesses increasing dramatically as well, said Scott Greenberg, senior analyst at the Foundation.\nIn 2012, pass-through businesses earned $1.63 trillion in net income, compared to $1.10 trillion of net income earned by C corporations -- the traditional kind of corporation that pays corporate taxes.\n\"As a result, focusing on the corporate income tax, as an indicator for how much American businesses (or even American corporations) are paying in taxes, can be quite misleading,\" Greenberg said. \"Because many businesses have switched away from the C corporate form, and are now taxed under the individual income tax, the comparison between corporate income tax revenue 50 years ago and today is not quite apples-to-apples.\""}

They were for non-binding resolutions and motions. McSally\u2019s and Sinema\u2019s votes have aligned at times to protect entitlement programs \u2014 McSally has been considered a moderate Republican, and Sinema touts having an independent voice. In one instance, they both voted in favor of an amendment that Pelosi said would cut Medicare and Social Security.\nWe rate Sinema\u2019s claim Half True.","full_article":"In the Arizona race to replace outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, Democratic contender Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is pointing to her stance on Medicare and Social Security to separate herself from other candidates and win seniors\u2019 votes.\n\"She understands that Medicare and Social Security aren\u2019t line items in a budget for politicians to cut \u2013 they\u2019re benefits Arizonans have earned through a lifetime of hard work,\" Sinema said on her campaign website. \"Kyrsten is committed to protecting benefits for current seniors and future generations, and she\u2019s the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age.\"\nArizona\u2019s primary election is Aug. 28. Sinema is the Democratic frontrunner. The top Republican challengers are Rep. Martha McSally, former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward, and Joe Arpaio, the controversial Maricopa County sheriff pardoned by President Donald Trump. Is Sinema \"the only\" Arizona Senate candidate refusing to make cuts to Medicare, Social Security or to raise the retirement age?\nSinema\u2019s team in response to PolitiFact\u2019s query narrowed down the claim to Sinema and McSally, saying they were the only two \"who have had to vote on entitlements\" and that the wording on Sinema\u2019s website didn\u2019t make a determination about \"what others may claim they will (or won\u2019t) do.\"\nWhile Sinema has a record of supporting Medicare and Social Security benefits, we found that her claim overplays the impact of some nonbinding measures voted on by her and McSally. Both lawmakers at times also voted the same way. McSally has generally been\u00a0perceived as a moderate Republican (though she\u2019s embraced a more conservative voice in the primary race), and Sinema bills herself as \"one of the most independent voices in Congress.\"\nComparing Sinema\u2019s and McSally\u2019s voting record\nSinema\u2019s campaign pointed to McSally\u2019s and Sinema\u2019s voting record on motions and concurrent resolutions \u2014 although those votes did not directly stop or allow changes to Social Security, Medicare, or the retirement age.\nFor instance, Sinema\u2019s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it. Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues.\nStill, budget resolutions even if they pass do not become law;\u00a0they lay out a plan. Budget resolutions also don\u2019t affect Social Security \u2014 at least not directly \u2014 because there are rules against it, Van de Water said.\nSinema\u2019s team pointed to McSally and Sinema\u2019s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored \"premium support\" program, or \"vouchers\" as Democrats critically call it.\nUnder the premium support\/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the premium support\/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending. Arguments against the switch include concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time.\nVan de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support\/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to the Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It\u2019s fair to say that voting for a premium support\/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said.\nMcSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support\/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema\u2019s team said, pointing to roll-calls and media reports.\nSinema\u2019s campaign also said that in 2013, Sinema and other lawmakers wrote to former President Barack Obama urging him to reject any budget proposal that would raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, specifically mentioning \"Chained CPI\" (an inflation adjustment measure).\nAs PolitiFact Florida reported, a proposal to use chained CPI for inflation would not have lowered seniors\u2019 Social Security checks, but their checks would have grown at a slower rate.\nThe impact of the proposal would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that became law, PolitiFact Florida found in a similar gubernatorial race fact-check.\nSinema\u2019s campaign also said McSally voted in favor of the tax cuts Trump signed into law late 2017 (Sinema voted against), saying they will lower Medicare and Social Security\u2019s projected revenue. We\u2019ve rated Half True claims linking the tax cuts to Medicare and Social Security\u2019s future payments. The tax cuts are projected to increase the deficit, and some Republicans have called for entitlement reform to address it. Experts say that potential changes or \"cuts\" to Medicare and Social Security would not be just because of the tax cuts. The programs already are on an unsustainable trajectory.\nWhile it's common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both.\nAsked about Sinema\u2019s position to ensure the program's financial viability in the future, her campaign didn\u2019t give specifics, saying only that Sinema \"believes we need to protect Medicare and Social Security benefits, weed out waste, fraud and abuse, and work together to ensure that the program is able to fulfill its long-term commitments to current and future retirees.\"\nThere are instances where McSally\u2019s and Sinema\u2019s votes aligned.\nSinema in April 2015 voted for a motion instructing House conferees to agree with the Senate in preventing Medicare from becoming a \"voucher program,\" Sinema\u2019s campaign said. The roll call shows McSally voted the same way.\nBoth lawmakers in October 2017 also voted against a budget proposal that called for \"slashing trillions from domestic and foreign-affairs programs and entitlements including Medicare and Medicaid, repealing the Affordable Care Act and changing Social Security,\" Tucson.com reported.\nMcSally\u2019s campaign did not push back on Sinema\u2019s claims about McSally\u2019s record. Instead, it spotlighted Sinema\u2019s own record.\nOne example McSally\u2019s campaign provided: Sinema in April 2018 voted in favor of a \"balanced-budget amendment,\" which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described as \"an act of breathtaking hypocrisy and an open assault on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,\" and one \"purpose-built to force devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\"\nMcSally also voted in favor of the proposal. It did not pass.\nWhile Sinema\u2019s team said her website\u2019s claim was only directed toward McSally, other candidates in the race, including Republicans Ward and Arpaio, told PolitiFact they opposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and raising the retirement age. Sinema\u2019s Democratic opponent in the primary, civil rights attorney Deedra Abboud, also said she was against cuts to seniors\u2019 benefits or raising the retirement age."}

John McCain, R-Ariz., offered a bit of context about how airstrikes in the region are proceeding.\nOn the May 24, 2015, edition of CBS\u2019 Face the Nation, McCain -- a leading Republican voice on military matters -- was asked by host Bob Schieffer, \"You have called this strategy a disaster. But what can, what should we be doing about this?\"\nMcCain responded that the first thing to do is to stop arguing that the United States is making significant progress against ISIS (also known as ISIL, the Islamic State\u00a0or DAESH).\n\"We need to have a robust strategy,\" McCain said. \"We need more troops on the ground. We need forward air controllers. But just referring to airstrikes, do you know that 75 percent of those combat missions return to base without having fired a weapon? It\u2019s because we don\u2019t have somebody on the ground who can identify \u2026 a moving target. ... We found in Vietnam that if you don\u2019t have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect.\"\nWe wondered whether it\u2019s correct that \"75 percent\" of combat airstrike missions \"return to base without having fired a weapon.\"\nWhen we checked with the senator\u2019s staff, they said that McCain -- who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee -- was basing his claim on data he was given by the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, the part of the military that oversees activities the region where the airstrikes are being carried out. The data McCain\u2019s staff had at the time of his appearance on Face the Nation showed that through the end of March, there had been 2,950 strikes out of 12,121 strike-sorties, or 24 percent. That leaves 75 percent of sorties that had no strikes. (Strike-sorties do not include support flights, such as those for surveillance or tanker refuelings.)\nWe double-checked with the Pentagon, and two officials said that McCain got his numbers right.\nAs of May 27, 2015, the United States had flown approximately 15,600 strike-sorties resulting in approximately 4,198 strikes, said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a spokeswoman with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. That works out to 27 percent -- slightly higher than the data McCain had, but close enough for our purposes.\nPentagon officials told PolitiFact that there was nothing unusual or surprising about that ratio.\n\"The fact that aircraft go on missions and don't strike anything is not out of the norm,\" said Air Force Capt. Andrew \"Ender\" Caulk of Air Forces Central Command Public Affairs. Despite U.S. strikes being \"the most precise in the history of warfare,\" Caulk said, \"conducting strike operations in the heavily populated areas where DAESH hides presents challenges. We are fighting an enemy who goes out of their way to put civilians at risk. However, the vast majority of pilots understand the need for the tactical patience in this environment. This fight against DAESH is not the kind of fight from previous decades.\"\nCaulk added that if the United States engaged \"the way some of these 'critics' want us to, we would be operating in violation of agreements established between the coalition nations and Iraq and putting civilians and Iraqi forces at greater risk. The bottom line: We will not stoop to the level of our enemy and put civilians more in harm's way than absolutely necessary.\""}

We have ruled Booker\u2019s statement as True.","full_article":"A few days before Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced the end of his White House bid, he encouraged Iowans with whom he was campaigning to disregard polling numbers when choosing a candidate in their state\u2019s first-in-the-nation presidential nominating precinct caucuses.\nBooker urged his Iowa audiences to caucus Feb. 3 for candidates who inspire them.\n\"Do not make this decision based on what the polls say,\" Booker said at a Jan. 9 event in North Liberty, Iowa. \"They've never predicted who will be president from our party. Carter was in the single digits a few months before caucuses. Bill Clinton was. Obama \u2014 20 points behind in the national polls roughly. And they all went on to be our president.\"\nWe found Booker\u2019s statement to be true, because, from 1972 to 2016, fewer than half of\u00a0 nonincumbent candidates who won the Democratic presidential nomination led national polls taken between November and January leading up to Iowa\u2019s caucuses. Moreover, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lagged behind in national polls in the months leading up to Iowa\u2019s caucuses.\nWe reached out to the Booker campaign for comment on Booker\u2019s statement and where he got his information from but received no response. Booker suspended his campaign on Jan. 13.\nTo research the numbers, we started with 1972 because that year marked the beginning of the\u00a0 Democratic Party\u2019s modern nominating process.\nDemocratic Party members are surveyed locally and nationally to take stock of the amount of support for a presidential candidate at a snapshot of time. Polling data are a determining factor in who gets to grace the party\u2019s debate stage, which gives presidential hopefuls a platform to pitch their ideas in front of a national audience and garner support from potential campaign donors and likely voters.\n\u2018They\u2019ve never predicted who will be president from our party\u2019\nFiveThirtyEight compiled polling data from competitive primary elections starting in 1972, comparing the eventual nominee\u2019s performance in the polls in the first and last halves of the calendar year to other Democratic contenders. From 1972 to 2016, it showed, only three out of 10 non-incumbent Democratic nominees were ahead in national polls up to three months before Iowa\u2019s caucuses.\nIn the last half of 1983, former Vice President Walter Mondale polled nationally at an average of 40.1 percent, leading throughout a six-month period. An early top-polling Democratic nominee didn\u2019t show up again until 2000, when Al Gore became the Democratic nominee after polling at an average 54.8 percent. Hillary Clinton had the highest pre-caucus polling numbers leading up to the 2016 caucuses, an average of 60.7 percent in the second half of 2015. But while each won the party\u2019s nomination none won the presidency.\nUniversity of Iowa political-science Professor Fred Boehmke wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan that too many unknowns exist to use polling numbers as a reliable predictor of nominees.\n\"So the short answer is that there is a lot of truth in what Booker says \u2014 polls won\u2019t tell us with great confidence who the nominee will be at convention time,\" Boehmke said, referring to the national nominating convention. \"It\u2019s not even that the polls might be wrong or poorly done.

It's the nomination. Because I think that's what that focus has to be.\"\nIn early January 1976, a national Gallup poll put Carter at 4 percent, with Hubert Humphrey in the lead at 29 percent. Gallup put Bill Clinton at 17 percent, 4 percentage points behind then-California Governor Jerry Brown, in early January 1992.\nAccording to December 2007 national polling data from Gallup, Obama\u2019s poll numbers were much lower than Hillary Clinton\u2019s before the Iowa caucuses. The polls put Obama at 27 percent, with Hillary Clinton in the lead with 45 percent."}

Reagan went on to beat Democrat Jimmy Carter in the November election.\nWith the Statue of Liberty in the background, Reagan paid tribute to immigrants, starting his speech by saying they came to America to work and helped build cities and \"incredibly productive farms.\"\nReagan twice said \"make America great again\": around the middle of the speech, when he spoke about what his administration will do; and toward the end of the speech, when he called on everyone to also \"make America great again.\"\nThe ad from Becoming American Initiative cut and patched together sentences. Below is a partial transcript of Reagan\u2019s speech, in bold are the words the ad highlighted.\n\"Through this Golden Door, under the gaze of that Mother of Exiles, has come millions of men and women, who first stepped foot on American soil right there, on Ellis Island, so close to the Statue of Liberty.\nThese families came here to work. They came to build. Others came to America in different ways, from other lands, under different, and often harrowing conditions, but this place symbolizes what they all managed to build, no matter where they came from or how they came or how much they suffered.\nThey helped to build that magnificent city across the river. They spread across the land building other cities and towns and incredibly productive farms.\nThey came to make America work. They didn\u2019t ask what this country could do for them but what they could do to make this, this refuge the greatest home of freedom in history.\nThey brought with them courage, ambition and the values of family, neighborhood, work, peace and freedom. We all came from different lands but we shared the same values, the same dream.\nToday a President of the United States would have us believe that dream is over or at least in need of change.\nJimmy Carter\u2019s Administration tells us that the descendants of those who sacrificed to start again in this land of freedom may have to abandon the dream that drew their ancestors to a new life in a new land.\nThe Carter record is a litany of despair, of broken promises, of sacred trusts abandoned and forgotten. ...\nThis country needs a new administration, with a renewed dedication to the dream of an America -- an administration that will give that dream new life and make America great again! Restoring and revitalizing that dream will take bold action. ...\nI want more than anything I've ever wanted, to have an administration that will, through its actions, at home and in the international arena, let millions of people know that Miss Liberty still \"lifts her lamp beside the golden door.\"\nThrough our international broadcasting stations -- the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and the others -- let us send, loud and clear, the message that this generation of Americans intends to keep that lamp shining; that this dream, that this dream the last best hope of man on earth, this nation under God, shall not perish from the earth.\nWe will instead carry on the building of an American economy that once again holds forth real opportunity for all, we shall continue to be a symbol of freedom and guardian of the eternal values that so inspired those who came to this port of entry.\nLet us pledge to each other, with this Great Lady looking on, that we can, and so help us God, we will make America great again.\"\nSeveral years later, Reagan signed into law the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards \u2014 including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers."}

But how do individual states within the U.S. compare with one another?\nThat\u2019s a subject Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised at a news conference while highlighting the need for increased testing capacity in Illinois to respond to the outbreak.\n\"Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we\u2019re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing because of the availability,\" Lightfoot said on April 7. \"It\u2019s not for lack of desire, it\u2019s for lack of the tests themselves, the reagents, some of the other materials that we need to be able to process the tests.\"\nIllinois, like many states, has struggled to expand testing due to the national shortage of tests and other supplies. And while the numbers are improving, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the state is still falling short of the goal he set for performing 10,000 tests per day. In an interview aired on April 14, the governor said the state is now conducting almost 8,000.\nBut Illinois is not unique in the testing challenges it is facing, so we wondered whether the state was really as far behind as Lightfoot suggested.\nIn response to our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the mayor\u2019s office acknowledged testing figures have improved somewhat from several weeks ago, but provided a March 27 report from ABC 7 that found more than half of all states had done more testing than Illinois had after accounting for population size, including neighboring Wisconsin.\nThose results were based on data from March 26 \u2014 almost two weeks before the mayor made her comparison. Given how rapidly testing data are fluctuating, we decided to evaluate her claim based on more recent figures.\nTo do that, we turned to data from the COVID Tracking Project, a source Lightfoot\u2019s office pointed to in a later response.\nThe project, which is managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, gathers data from state health departments around the country and provides figures on the total number of tests conducted by both public and commercial labs.\nIts database shows Lightfoot was partly right and partly wrong when she said Illinois was testing at a rate that put it behind all its neighbors as well as in the \"bottom tier\" nationwide.\nThe day Lightfoot made her claim, Illinois ranked 28 out of all 50 states for testing on a per capita basis, figures from the project show. Its ranking has improved only slightly in the time since, with the state coming in 24th as of April 14. Its current tally of just over 110,600 total tests comes out to about 8,730 tests per million residents. New York, which tops the list, has run more than 25,650 tests per million.\nBut Lightfoot\u2019s Illinois comparison doesn\u2019t hold when it comes to the states it borders. On the day she made her claim, Illinois came out slightly ahead of Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Iowa. And in the days since, its lead has continued to grow.\nGiven how frequently testing figures change \u2014 along with differences in the ways states report their data \u2014 that lead in the Midwest may not mean much. But it\u2019s enough to show Lightfoot is incorrect in her assertion that Illinois is trailing the region."}

They also say transportation costs are a small factor in the cost of oil products.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.","full_article":"One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first official acts effectively halted construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was designed to help carry up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast.\nDoes his executive order also make oil more costly for average Americans?\nA Facebook post, appearing eight days after the order, claimed: \"Stopping the pipeline did not change our use of oil. It just made oil more expensive for us to use. Thanks Joe!! What an idiot!!!\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThere\u2019s no evidence yet that Biden\u2019s decision, which fulfilled a\u00a0campaign promise dating back to at least May 2020, triggered any spike in oil prices that affects consumers now.\nBut what about the impact over time?\u00a0We talked to several experts to gauge what effect Biden\u2019s order might have on future prices consumers pay for refined oil products like gasoline, diesel or heating oil.\nSome said that given constant demand, taking away the pipeline option would make transporting crude oil less efficient and more costly, at least for producers.\nBut most of them said they doubted that those higher costs would make their way to U.S. consumers, given where the Canadian oil was likely headed, and how the oil markets operate.\nThe pipeline and Biden\u2019s order\nThe Keystone XL pipeline, first proposed more than a decade ago, was to have transported crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.\nThe Trump administration backed the project in the face of objections from environmental groups. The company building it announced in March 2020 that it was launching construction, saying it would invest $8 billion in the project, with service expected to begin in 2023. But the project was stalled again by litigation over environmental concerns.\nBiden\u2019s order revoked the pipeline\u2019s construction permit. He said the pipeline would \"not be consistent with my administration\u2019s economic and climate imperatives.\"\nNo immediate price boost\nFor two benchmark products, the price of oil trended downward in the time between Biden\u2019s order and the Facebook post.\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the spot market was $53.16 per barrel on Jan. 20, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It was lower each day between then and Jan. 28, the date of the Facebook post, when it was $52.26. The price of Europe Brent was $55.66 per barrel on Jan. 20. It rose 2 cents the next day, but then was lower each day and was $54.87 on Jan. 28.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Department of Energy told us they had no analyses on what suspending the pipeline might do to prices.\nSeveral energy economics experts we talked to said they saw no evidence that Biden's order has already had an impact on the cost of oil, particularly for consumers.\nBecause the pipeline \"would not be available for some time, I do not see how the Biden decision could have already affected the price of oil for consumers,\" said Jay Hakes, administrator of the EIA during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. \"If there is any long-term impact on prices at the pump, the change would be very small and unnoticed by customers.\"\nHow experts see the impact on costs\nSome experts expect that Biden\u2019s order will result in higher costs in the future, at least for producers, if oil demand recovers.\n\"It almost certainly will. Killing KXL does nothing to reduce demand for hydrocarbons. It will only make everything more expensive for consumers,\" said Michelle Michot Foss, a fellow in energy, minerals and materials at Rice University in Houston.\n\"Constraining sources of supply, especially when demand is building, always impacts prices,\" Foss said. \"Give it a year.\"\nBrook Simmons, president of the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, said that \"without pipeline transportation, product must be moved by less efficient, more costly\" rail or truck.\nToby Mack, president of the Energy Equipment and Infrastructure Alliance, which represents businesses that support natural gas and oil operations, cited a 2014 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service on railroad transportation of crude oil that said \"railroad transport reportedly costs in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 per barrel compared with $5 per barrel for pipeline.\" That report also said the Keystone XL \"could move a significant proportion\" of crude oil shipments \"off the rails, as pipeline transportation is likely to cost less per barrel.\"\nOther experts don\u2019t see those higher transport costs automatically being passed on to U.S. consumers, for a variety of reasons. They point to larger market forces that affect prices, including the relatively high worldwide supply of oil. Plus, they note, most oil passing through the Keystone would have been exported, so Americans wouldn\u2019t be the ones paying for it.\nLess pipeline capacity likely means Canadian oil producers have to use rail more to transport oil to refiners. But they would be under competitive pressure to absorb the added costs of that rather than passing them on, said Richard Masson, chairman of the World Petroleum Council Canada and an executive fellow at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy.\n\"This is because U.S. refiners, particularly on the Gulf Coast where KXL was aimed, have the ability to import crude from tankers, and therefore pay the global price for it,\" he said. \"If Canadian crude was to get more expensive than global crudes on tankers, the U.S. refiners would shift to a higher level of tanker imports.\"\nHakes said most analysts believe that delivery by rail is somewhat more expensive than delivery by pipeline, \"but the difference is slight and transportation of crude oil to refineries is a very small part of the overall cost of gasoline at the pump. That is why, if the argument is that motorists will see a difference in purchase prices, it is highly dubious.\"\nMoreover, the world can currently produce much more oil than is needed to meet demand, so \"I am confident that the cancellation or delay of the Keystone pipeline would not have any impact on gasoline prices at the pump,\" Hakes said.\nGlobal demand for oil has been depressed over the past year by economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEconomics professor Robert Godby, deputy director of the University of Wyoming's Center for Energy Regulation and Policy, said oil prices are set in world markets and \"we don\u2019t suffer from supply constraints in this country that raise the cost of oil.\"\nThe Keystone XL \"could have alleviated some local and regional pipeline bottlenecks in the upper Midwest and northern Rocky Mountain region, but overall should not have been expected to lower oil or gasoline prices in the U.S.,\" he said.\nKeystone XL was not designed to supply the U.S. market, but to deliver oil from Canada mainly for export to foreign markets, said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen. The consumer advocacy group, which opposes the pipeline, has argued that historically, the average U.S. price of gasoline rises when domestic oil exports increase."}

We found many examples from 2006 to 2009 when Donald Trump spoke of the \"great opportunity\" that came with falling real estate prices.\nOne of the earliest instances was in a Trump audiobook from 2006.\nThe man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, \"There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?\"\n\"Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position \u2014 which I'm in a good cash position today \u2014 then people like me would go in and buy like crazy,\" he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. \"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money.\"\nNow that was before the collapse that led to the Great Recession, and arguably, Trump was simply offering sound business guidance.\nTrump touted the same view a couple of times in 2007. But at that point, the country still was not looking at an economic catastrophe.\nThe situation was quite different by early 2009. The investment house Lehman Brothers had filed for bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. The Dow had suffered its worst weekly loss ever. Washington had bailed out General Motors and Chrysler. Foreclosures were rising weekly.\nTrump was on CNN Feb. 17, 2009, talking about the economy with host Wolf Blitzer and said the moment was a \"great opportunity.\" Blitzer asked Trump why.\n\"If you get something really prime, really good, eventually it's going to be worth a lot more than you paid,\" Trump explained. \"I used to tell people two years ago, don't buy real estate and I used to preach it hard. And now I'm saying, I think that this is a good time. Whether you hit the exact market or not, I can't tell you. But I think this is a great time to buy. If you have cash, this is the great time to buy.\"\nTo be clear, Trump was speaking as an investor. He was not necessarily rooting for the housing crisis. But it was under way as he spoke.\nWe reached out to the Trump campaign and did not receive any information to add to this picture."}

Ron Johnson tells viewers in a new television ad, \"I respect you enough to tell you the truth.\"\nBut his Democratic challenger has suggested otherwise.\nAt a Milwaukee campaign event in May 2016, Russ Feingold said Johnson touted a worker protection program called Trade Adjustment Assistance to justify his support for free trade agreements \u2014 even though Johnson had sought to eliminate the program.\nFeingold said: \"Let's be very clear. Senator Johnson says \u2014 to excuse his position on trade agreements \u2014 he says, well, we have the TAA. Guess who voted to eliminate it.\"\nWhen Feingold was asked by reporters to elaborate, he said Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers who were eligible for the program.\nIs Feingold right?\nHow the program works\nThe Trade Adjustment Assistance program dates to the 1970s and was created to help workers who lost their jobs -- or whose wages or hours have been cut -- because of foreign competition. The program, in part, offers displaced workers temporary benefits and pays to train them with new skills so they can find a new job.\nIn Wisconsin, the federal government has spent nearly $220 million in the last six years for worker benefits and training, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That includes money for enhanced vocational training through the state\u2019s technical colleges in programs such as information technology, healthcare and manufacturing.\nProponents of the TAA program say it can lessen the blow of job losses that occur when companies move operations overseas to reduce labor costs \u2014 a practice that critics contend is facilitated by free trade agreements the United States has struck with other countries.\nJohnson has voiced general support for free trade, while Feingold voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement when he was a U.S. senator and has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nFeingold\u2019s claim has two parts:\nDid Johnson specifically cite the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a defense of trade agreements?\nWhen we asked Feingold\u2019s campaign for backup, officials pointed to a statement Johnson made in a May 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article: \"Free trade does help all economies. And there are dislocations. There are protections against those dislocations. We all support being able to help workers that have been displaced.\"\nDespite what Feingold said, Johnson did not explicitly refer to the TAA in that statement. Rather he voiced general support for helping displaced workers.\nIndeed, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us the TAA is \"ineffective and duplicative\" and in need of \"major reforms.\"\nJohnson\u2019s campaign also pointed to a House Budget Committee report that said the federal government has other forms of aid, including at least 35 job training programs among eight departments and agencies.\nThere are \"dozens of programs to help people who need assistance,\" Reisinger said.\nDid Johnson vote to eliminate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program?\nJohnson voted in September 2011 against a bill to reauthorize the program, although the measure passed despite his opposition.\nFeingold also noted that Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers eligible for TAA help.\nThose grants were part of the 2009 economic stimulus package, which was approved before Johnson was in office. But Johnson voted for legislation in 2011 that would have reduced TAA spending to pre-2009 levels; that proposal also failed.\nAt the time, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he offered the measure because of concerns with TAA\u2019s effectiveness and because stimulus spending was supposed to be temporary."}

Rick Scott wants Florida lawmakers to revisit the 2011 elections overhaul, which was widely blamed for problems with early voting during last year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nIn an interview on Miami-based WPLG Channel 10, Scott stressed he wants local supervisors to have the option to implement the most early voting hours in Florida history.\n\n\"What I think we ought to be doing is give the flexibility to our supervisors of elections, most of them, as you know, are elected county by county, but say you can do anywhere from eight to 14 days, six to 12 hours a day,\" Scott said in the Jan. 18, 2013, interview, \"so a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we\u2019ve ever had.\"\n\nScott, who refused to extend early voting in 2012 despite long lines at some polls, is also calling on the Legislature to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day -- the day when African-American groups hosted popular \"Souls to the Polls\" events.\n\nHere we\u2019ll examine whether Scott is right to say his proposal would be the most hours for early voting.\n\nFlorida\u2019s history with early voting is short.\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush signed early voting into law in 2004. That law required early voting to start 15 days before an election, with at least eight hours per weekday and eight hours total for each weekend. Voters had 104 early voting hours.\n\nEven though election supervisors asked for more hours and more locations, Bush and the GOP-led Legislature passed a new law in 2005 that reduced hours and confined voting to election offices, city halls and libraries. Under the new law, early voting lasted 14 days, for eight hours on weekdays and a total of eight hours on the weekend. That\u2019s 96 hours.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, voters had more time to vote early thanks to an emergency extension\u00a0ordered by Gov. Charlie Crist (read that executive order.) Many news accounts put the total number of early voting hours in 2008 at 120, but the Department of State calculates it at 116.\n\nIn 2011, the Legislature passed a sweeping elections law\u00a0that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. (Here\u2019s a related check\u00a0on that.) So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days.\n\nThe Legislature is poised to tweak the state\u2019s early voting system again in 2013 because of the long waits to vote in some places during the 2012 presidential election.\n\nScott, echoing proposals from the elections supervisors association, recommended the Legislature give supervisors the ability to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. He also wants to add more early voting sites.\n\nSo under Scott\u2019s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). On the flip side, the fewest number of hours they would be required to offer is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours).\n\nActivists behind the liberal campaign Pink Slip Rick disapproved of Scott\u2019s proposal, saying Scott should have restored the number of days for early voting to 14, the way it was before the 2011 election law.\n\n\"Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting,\" said Amy Ritter, executive director of Florida Watch Action, the liberal group behind Pink Slip Rick.\n\nA few election supervisors we interviewed about Scott\u2019s plan said they welcomed the idea of tailoring early voting to their home county\u2019s needs.\n\n\"We kind of came to the conclusion that obviously, with Florida being such a huge and diverse state, one size does not fit all,\" said Brian Corley, Pasco County supervisor of elections.\n\nCorley, who heads up legislative affairs for the state supervisors association, said he does not think Pasco would need the full 168 hours, but \"it\u2019s nice to have the option, if need be, for a major presidential election.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes said her office had not yet begun planning for the scenario under Scott\u2019s plan but would probably go back to 14 days of early voting, the way things were before the Legislature\u2019s 2011 law.\n\n\"We would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to HB 1355,\" said public services director Mary Cooney in an email.\n\nOur ruling\nScott said that his proposal would allow \"a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we\u2019ve ever had\" for early voting. He\u2019s right that his proposal would give supervisors of elections the option to offer 168 hours of early voting, and that would be a record.\nWe should note that supervisors would also have the option to only offer 48 hours of voting, which is less than previous law.

Let\u2019s take a look.\nBills, bills, bills\nThe article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law:\n\"One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on \u2018evidence-based policy making.\u2019 \"\nA visit to Ryan\u2019s profile at Congress.gov shows \u2014 when filtered by \"Sponsored Legislation\" and \"Became Law\" \u2014 the same three bills referenced in the article.\nWhile Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills \"sponsored\" by Ryan.\n\"Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill,\" Canon wrote in an email. \"Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill.\"\nAccording to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law.\nNew York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement\u2019s context in the article reflects that.\nBut Ryan\u2019s camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan\u2019s tenure.\n\"Any realistic look at (Ryan\u2019s) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong,\" said spokesman Ian Martorana.\nHe references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write:\nMurray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013\n\n\nTrade Promotion Authority legislation in 2015\n\n\nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms\nFor four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said.\nJennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator.\n\"Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment,\" she wrote in an email. \"Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor.\"\nWhile this legislator hasn\u2019t changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic.\nMeasuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill\u2019s content and committee chairs, while they don\u2019t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators.\nA better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers.\nIt takes into account the content of a lawmaker\u2019s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker\u2019s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker\u2019s impact.\nBy this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999.\nThe expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held."}

They show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage increase.","full_article":"Hillary Clinton colluded with big business to maintain slave wages for workers in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, according to the host of an RT American comedy news show.\nComedian and activist Lee Camp of RT\u2019s Redacted Tonight mocked Clinton\u2019s efforts to \"keep 37 cents per hour out of the hands of destitute Haitians.\"\n\"In 2009, while Bill Clinton was setting up one of the family\u2019s shell companies in New York, in that same year Hillary Clinton was at the State Department working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents,\" Camp said April 17. \"Seriously.\"\nSeriously?\nSort of. Memos from 2008 and 2009 obtained by Wikileaks strongly suggest, but don\u2019t prove without a doubt, that the State Department helped block the proposed minimum wage increase. The memos show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage hike and met multiple times with factory owners who directly lobbied against it to the Haitian president.\nThe Clinton campaign refuted the claim, and the State Department didn't comment.\nHOPE, not change\nIn 2011, Wikileaks made nearly 2,000 cables available to the progressive magazine, The Nation,\u00a0and Haiti Libert\u00e9, a weekly newspaper in Port-au-Prince.\nThe two media outlets assessed the cables and found, among many other revelations, that the \"U.S. Embassy in Haiti worked closely with factory owners contracted by Levi\u2019s, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom to aggressively block a paltry minimum wage increase\" for workers in apparel factories.\nThe Wikileaks cables show U.S. Embassy officials began monitoring the minimum wage issue as early as 2008, when the Haitian Parliament began discussing doubling or tripling the daily minimum wage of 70 Haitian gourdes to keep up with inflation. That\u2019s roughly equal to $1.75 a day, or about 22 cents per hour.\n(Some context here: Three quarters of Haitians live on less than $2 a day, according to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Program, while garments constitute about 90 percent of Haiti\u2019s exports, according to the Guardian. Haiti increased the daily minimum wage to the equivalent of $5.11 in 2014.)\nBut back in 2008 and 2009, embassy officials repeatedly told Washington that a hike would hurt the economy and undermine U.S. trade preference legislation known as HOPE.\nThe program, shorthand for the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, gives garments manufactured on the island duty free access to U.S. markets. Levi Strauss, Haneswear, Nautica, and Dockers are just some of the American companies that benefit from HOPE. Congress passed HOPE II in 2008, extending the program for another 10 years.\nIn January 2008, Ambassador Janet Sanderson wrote that representatives of the business community \u2014 including the man tasked with implementing HOPE \u2014 had met with embassy officials and criticized Haitian President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val\u2019s efforts to raise the minimum wage as the wrong medicine for the ailing economy.\nAn unsigned embassy cable sent to Washington in December 2008 echoed the private sector\u2019s assessment and reported that increasing the minimum wage would \"have significant impact\" on business.\nThe State Department continued to promote HOPE as an economic boon for the island. In memos prepping U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and Clinton for their visits to Haiti, charg\u00e9 d'affaires Thomas Tighe told the diplomats to \"urge\" \u00a0the Haitian government take advantage of HOPE and HOPE II.\nAfter advising a congressional delegation to Haiti almost exactly the same thing, Sanderson told Washington that Haitian Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis was onboard with HOPE, \"although pending legislation to nearly triple the minimum wage would likely set back those efforts in the short term.\"\nDeputy Chief of Mission David Lindwall put it most bluntly, when he said the minimum wage law \"did not take economic reality into account but that appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.\"\nPr\u00e9val as proxy\nNonetheless, the Haitian Parliament voted to triple the daily minimum wage to 200 gourdes ($5 a day, or about 62 cents per hour) in May 2009. As the bill awaited President Pr\u00e9val\u2019s signature, students protested over the delay while factory owners criticized the legislation.\nThe U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, continued to lament the hike and raised concerns about the stability of the region that they hoped Pr\u00e9val would help address, according to the cables. Pr\u00e9val, as they say, leaned in.\nSanderson, in a June 10 memo, cited a study by the Haitian Association of Industry (ADIH) stating that the new minimum wage \"would result in the loss of 10,000 workers in the sector\" and noted that ADIH has met with Pr\u00e9val three times.\n\"A more visible and active engagement by Pr\u00e9val may be critical to resolving the issue of the minimum wage and its protest \u2018spin-off' \u2014 or risk the political environment spiraling out of control,\" she wrote.\nA few days later, Pr\u00e9val seemed to be on board with the embassy and industry position on the minimum wage issue.\nOn June 17, Tighe told Washington that industry and USAID studies found that a 200 gourdes minimum wage \"would make the sector economically unviable and consequently force factories to shut down.\"\nHe also noted that ADIH members and HOPE factory owners told U.S. officials that in lieu of greenlighting the legislation as is, Pr\u00e9val would instead propose a lower, phased-in minimum wage for the textiles sector (100 gourdes in 2009, 125 gourdes in 2010, and 150 gourdes in 2011).\nProtesters continued to call for Pr\u00e9val to sign the original bill, with some demonstrations escalating into violence, as parliament considered the president\u2019s amendments.\nIn a June 24 cable to a congressional delegation, Tighe said the demonstrations added uncertainty to the political and security situation in Haiti and \u00a0\"job creation under HOPE II may be threatened by a bill Parliament passed May 5 to nearly triple the minimum wage.\"\nWhen the delegation met with Pr\u00e9val the next day, the president parroted this line and encouraged the congressmen \"to write to Haitian members of Parliament to express concern about the devastating impact a sector-wide increase in wages would have on job security and job creation,\" according to a memo from Tighe.\nBy July, Pr\u00e9val was a formal and vocal opponent of the 200 gourds wage, warning of the consequences for jobs and emphasizing the importance of the assembly sector for exports, according to cables.\n\"This is the only issue in recent memory where the president has made a strong effort, by negotiating with stakeholders and using the media, to effect a legislative outcome,\" Tighe said.\nIn the fall of 2009, Pr\u00e9val and Parliament agreed to enact the $5 daily wage for all sectors except textiles, which got a $3 wage. But was the State Department right in opposing the increase?\n\"I have no idea what would happen if Haiti did have a $5-a-day minimum wage,\" Adam Davidson of NPR\u2019s Planet Money said in 2011. \"But I do think it's reasonable to assume that some factories would close and far fewer new ones would be built. Far fewer Haitians would be allowed to take that first tentative step on to the ladder of industrial development.\""}

All three have advocated for a change from a flat income tax rate to a graduated-rate system in which tax rates are higher for those with higher incomes.\nDespite Rauner\u2019s examples, a progressive income tax system does not necessarily mean a tax increase for the middle class. And there is no evidence that anyone in Illinois politics has a blueprint for income and tax brackets under a potential Illinois system. The closest such blueprint, from 2012, had the vast majority of voters paying the same or lower taxes.\nNor is that decision up to the governor. It would take three-fifths of the General Assembly and a majority of voters to bring a progressive tax to reality. Recent history does not point favorably to this happening without significant Democratic gains in the Legislature.\nPritzker was squishy when discussing immediate revenue needs with Crain\u2019s, but Rauner cites the Crain\u2019s article as Pritzker\u2019s solid endorsement of a \"massive tax increase.\"  We rate Rauner\u2019s statement Mostly False.","full_article":"Speaking to reporters after a speech in Chicago on Dec. 4, Gov. Bruce Rauner predicted a re-election victory in next year\u2019s gubernatorial race and warned of dire tax consequences if any of the three main Democratic candidates for the post win.\n\"You know what will happen? We will get a massive income tax hike. The candidates controlled by (House Speaker Michael) Madigan, all of them have said, \u2018The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike,\u2019 \" Rauner said, referring to Democratic candidates Daniel Biss, Chris Kennedy and JB Pritzker.\nAll three have stated they support replacing Illinois\u2019 flat-rate income tax with a system in which those with higher incomes pay higher rates.\nRauner went on to list examples of other states \u2014 New Jersey, New York, Minnesota and California \u2014 where people earning $40,000 a year pay more in state income tax than the 4.95 percent rate now applied to all Illinois taxpayers.\n\"They will sock the middle class with a tax hike that Madigan and his puppets want and it will destroy Illinois,\" Rauner said, noting that the progressive tax movement would be deceptively labeled as a \"tax the rich\" effort.\nRauner\u2019s statement contained a generous dollop of campaign vitriol \u2014 the Madigan-as-puppet-master theme is a running theme for Rauner \u2014 but it also brings up what is sure to be another key issue in the governor\u2019s race. Would a Democratic victory for governor next year bring about a graduated-rate income tax for Illinois? And would that be tantamount to a \"massive income tax hike?\"\nLong road ahead\nRauner\u2019s statement implies a Democratic governor could muscle through a change that would replace Illinois\u2019 current flat-rate income tax system with a multi-rate system. That overlooks the fact that the single-rate income tax is enshrined in the Illinois Constitution of 1970, establishing a high hurdle for enacting any change.\n\"A tax on or measured by income shall be at a non-graduated rate,\" begins Article IX, Section 3 of the constitution.\nTo impose a progressive tax system lawmakers would have to amend the constitution. That requires approval of three-fifths majorities in both the Illinois House and Senate to put the issue on a general election ballot. Then voters must approve the amendment by \"either three-fifths of those voting on the question or a majority of those voting in\nthe election,\" according to Article XIV, Section 2 of the constitution.\nFrom 2013 to 2017, Democrats held three-fifths majorities in both the House and Senate yet still could not muster votes to back ballot referendums on a limited graduated income tax plan to impose higher rates on the very rich.\nSince then, Democrats have lost their three-fifths margin in the House, though they control the chamber. In theory that could change in the next election, but to push through a tax referendum in the House before then would require a handful of Republican votes. And that\u2019s not likely to happen.\nThe governor, incidentally, is irrelevant in this process. There is no veto power over constitutional amendments. If approved by voters, they become law.\nUnder the constitution, the only path to get a tax referendum before voters is through the Legislature. Citizen-led petition drives for such a purpose are not allowed.\nBracketology\nRauner also equates a graduated tax system to a \"massive tax increase\" on the middle class.\nBut he tries to make the point with cherry-picked examples.\nA single filer earning $40,000 annually in California pays 6 percent. It\u2019s 5.525 percent in New Jersey, 6.45 percent in New York and 7.05 percent in Minnesota, according to 2017 tax data compiled by The Tax Foundation. Those tax rates are all higher than the 4.95 percent now imposed on Illinois taxpayers.\nBut there are other graduated income tax states Rauner failed to cite where the numbers would undermine his premise.\nIndividuals earning $40,000 a year pay 3.36 percent under Arizona\u2019s graduated-rate system. In Maryland, those who earn between $3,000 and $100,000 pay 4.75 percent. North Dakota taxes $40,000 at 2.04 percent, and its highest bracket imposes only a 2.9 percent rates on incomes over $416,700. Ohio\u2019s top rate, 4.997 percent, applies to income of more than $210,600. Those in Ohio earning $40,000 pay 2.969 percent. Even Connecticut\u2019s 5-percent tax on $40,000 is very close to Illinois\u2019 4.95 percent. (Connecticut\u2019s top bracket, 6.99 percent, kicks in at $500,000 for individual filers.)\nWhile Democratic candidates say they support a graduated-rate system, they have been talking in the abstract and none have proposed specific rates. Given the difficulty of amending the constitution, lawmakers would be loath to enshrine tax and income brackets into it, and any rate-setting would fall to the legislature after a constitutional change.\nThe realpolitik of that hasn\u2019t stopped Rauner from predicting how it would all play out. \"They say, \u2018Let\u2019s tax the rich,\u2019\" Rauner said in the same Dec. 4 press conference. \"Well, first of all, you watch business owners flood out of this state when that happens and our unemployment rate is going to go through the roof.\"\nImmobile movement\nThe last big push for a comprehensive progressive tax amendment came during the 2013-14 legislative session and it died without receiving a vote in either the House or Senate. The proposal contained no income or tax bracket figures.\nIn 2012, the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning fiscal watchdog, created a progressive tax model in which taxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000 \u2014 94 percent of those in Illinois \u2014 would pay the same or less than the 5 percent tax rate in effect at that time. The model nonetheless projected a 5.8 percent increase in revenue from the income tax because of higher rates on the wealthiest Illinoisans.\nCTBA Budget Director Bobby Otter said that model would likely hold up today because the current Illinois tax rate, 4.95 percent, is close to that used to make the projection.\nThe easy way\nRaising taxes is never easy, but procedurally it is easier to change rates than change the constitution. Indeed, the Illinois tax rate has bounced around in recent years, from 5 percent in 2010 to 3.75 percent in 2015 to 4.95 percent starting last summer.\nWhen we contacted Rauner\u2019s campaign to ask whether the Republican believed a Democratic successor would try to raise the latest rate, spokesman Justin Giorgio referred us to a recent column in The News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana.\nThat column focused on reporting by Crain\u2019s Chicago business about a Nov. 20 visit by Pritzker to its editorial board. During that visit, the Democrat mentioned a progressive income tax and potentially new tax revenue for the state if it legalized marijuana. Pritzker was not quoted as directly calling for a tax hike:\nSome will come from amending the Illinois Constitution to allow a progressive income tax, something that would require a referendum vote, likely in 2020. Pritzker said he could not estimate how much that would pull in, but he projected the state would net another $300 million to $700 million by legalizing and taxing marijuana.\n\nWould that be enough to meet all the needs while (economic) growth accelerates?\n\n\"No. But it depends on how you prioritize,\" Pritzker replied.\nAfter the meeting, a Pritzker campaign spokeswoman issued a statement to clarify that \"J.B. does not believe we should raise taxes on middle-class families, period.\"\nIn sum, Pritzker backs a graduated tax amendment, thinks it will reap more revenue for the state and acknowledges that still may not be sufficient to meet needs. But his spokeswoman suggests only the wealthy should be asked to pay more. (The article cited by the Rauner campaign discussed only Pritzker, though Biss and Kennedy have endorsed the progressive tax concept.)"}

Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","full_article":"Ted Cruz said a court order prevents children from staying with immigrating\u00a0parents who are jailed at the U.S.-Mexico border.\nA reader asked us if that\u2019s so.\nCruz, the Texas Republican seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2018, said in an interview aired June 11, 2018, that when Barack Obama was president, families entering the country were able to stay together because adults were released rather than detained. For longer than that, immigrants entering the country illegally as families were rarely criminally prosecuted, and many parents and children were placed in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported.\nOf late, though, the government has cracked down on parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission. In April 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would go to detention centers, leaving their newly unaccompanied children to be managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.\nOn \"Think,\" a public-affairs program produced at Dallas-based KERA radio, Cruz said:\n\"You know, you think about it, when someone gets arrested for a crime -- let\u2019s say an American citizen gets arrested for a crime, for murder, for burglary, for whatever \u2014 if you\u2019re arrested for a crime, you\u2019re separated from your children, you\u2019re put in prison. If you\u2019re the only caregiver for that child, then you\u2019ve got to find alternative care for those children. That is often another family member or, if need be, it\u2019s a foster family or some other means to care for kids. That is the inevitable consequence of somebody being arrested for a crime.\n\"This is an issue that, I think, the media has largely constructed because what\u2019s shifted is that the (President Donald) Trump administration is endeavoring if people cross illegally to arrest them, not to let them go--and so if they have kids, you know, there is actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail.\"\nA 1997 agreement\nWe sought detail about the described order; Maria Jeffrey in Cruz\u2019s Senate office told us by email that Cruz was referring to a 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department.\nWe didn\u2019t spot language in the January 1997 agreement in Flores v. Reno that explicitly bars children from staying with parents who have been detained or jailed. (See our summary of the agreement here.)\nThere\u2019s no such provision in the agreement, immigration lawyers told us.\n\"Absolutely not,\" Denise Gilman, who heads an immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said by email, a conclusion also aired by Peter Schey of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights, which was involved in\u00a0the litigation that led to the agreement.\nMuzaffar Chishti, a New York lawyer for the Migration Policy Institute, called Cruz\u2019s claim an \"inverse interpretation\" of the Flores agreement. \"He\u2019s basically saying a court order that mandates protecting children is the one that says you must separate families,\" Chishti said by phone. Put another way, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law said by email that the Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but Su said it doesn\u2019t condone or require the separation of children from parents.\n\u2018Least restrictive setting\u2019\nWe read the agreement, which says it sets out national policy for the detention, release and treatment of minors in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the government agency overseeing immigration matters before Congress after 9\/11 reorganized and renamed departments under the new Department of Homeland Security.\n\"The INS,\" the agreement states, \"shall place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor\u2019s age and special needs\" provided the minor is poised to make timely appearances before immigration authorities and her or his well-being is protected.\nWe noticed, too, that the agreement stresses keeping children close to parents and extended family.\nFor instance, it says INS facilities will provide \"contact with family members who were arrested with the minor\" and segregate unaccompanied minors from unrelated adults.\nAlso, the agreement says, where the INS finds the detention of a minor isn\u2019t required to secure his or her timely appearance, it shall release the minor \"without unnecessary delay.\" The minor, the agreement says, should be released, in order of preference, to a parent, a legal guardian, an adult relative or an adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian or parent. Subsequent choices, the agreement says, extend to licensed programs or, ultimately, another adult or entity seeking custody as an alternative to long-term custody and when \"family reunification does not appear to be a reasonable possibility.\"\nInstructions to INS \"service officers\" in the agreement include a section titled \"family reunification,\" which says: \"Upon taking a minor into custody, the INS, or the licensed program in which the minor is placed, will promptly attempt to reunite the minor with his or her family to permit the release of the minor\" in accord with the agreement\u2019s order-of-preference list. \"Such efforts at family reunification,\" the instructions say, \"will continue so long as the minor is in INS or licensed program custody.\"\nAdditional interpretation\nWe asked Cruz\u2019s aide to point out the part of the agreement requiring the separation of children from parents. By email, Jeffrey noted the mandate that minors be placed in the \"least restrictive\" setting and the section about minors being released to family members if possible.\nJeffrey further pointed out that the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 held that the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. In that dispute, over the Obama administration placing children with their parents in family detention centers, the appeals court upheld a lower court\u2019s refusal to amend the Flores agreement to accommodate family detention--after which, Su told us, the Obama administration chose to simply release such parents and children.\nJeffrey wrote that Cruz\u2019s \"point is simple and 100% correct: When the parents are detained, the Flores agreement compels placing the child with another family member or in another less restrictive setting.\"\nSu alerted us to another arguably influential factor; a 2008 law requires immigration officials holding a minor to transfer the minor to the care of HHS within 72 hours \"after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child,\" the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 states.\nGovernment has options\nGilman said Cruz\u2019s claim misleads in part by suggesting parents are getting shuttled into criminal jails and then children, newly unaccompanied, quickly must be handed off to the refugee resettlement office.\nWhat actually happens, Gilman wrote, is that parents and children are detained in a border facility and children are taken from parents while the family is at the facility, before criminal charges are brought. Next, Gilman wrote, children are taken into custody and away from the facility by refugee resettlement staff. Only then, Gilman said, are the parents criminally prosecuted before being given a sentence of time served, \"which really is just the time spent at the border facility,\" Gilman said.\nNext, Gilman said, parents are returned to the border facility \"but the child is already gone.\" At that point, the parents are typically sent to an adult immigration detention facility to spend several months--even if they\u2019re successful in passing an asylum screening interview and getting released on bond, Gilman wrote.\nSu called Cruz\u2019s claim technically correct but misleading in that it leaves the inaccurate impression that the government, by policy and law, has no choice but to separate children from parents.\n\"The Trump administration\u2019s hands were not forced,\" Su wrote. \"There are multiple ways that separation could be avoided and the nation's interest in immigration adjudication and removal could still be maintained. But the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy of detaining and criminally prosecuting all immigrants, even those who arrived with children, is what has led to this.\"\nSumming up, Su said the 2008 law, Flores agreement and court rulings effectively bar the government from sending a detained parent and child to an adult prison together. By policy, Su said, the Trump administration made clear it wasn\u2019t in favor of releasing parents and children--which left it with the options of sending parents to prison and releasing children or sending parents to prison and sending children to child detention facilities overseen by the government.\nSu said Cruz\u2019s claim, intimating the government has had no choice but to separate children from parents, also overlooks the government\u2019s power to release children to other family members or guardians or even to expand family detention centers so long as they fulfill the agreement\u2019s \"least restrictive setting\" requirement.\n\"So yes,\" Su said, \"Cruz is right that once you have make the decision to send the parents to jail, separation may be necessary because Flores generally forbids the government from detaining children in jail,\" Su wrote.\n\"Although given the horrors of separation, and the rumors of children not being reunited with their parents even after removal,\" Su said, \"it may be that keeping parents and children together in jail would be the \u2018least restrictive setting\u2019 if the other option is separation. It is important to note that, from my reading, neither the Flores settlement nor the litigants and judge involved foresaw that the settlement would lead to separation of parents of children,\" Su said."}
