"With voting by mail, “you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.”","Trump said that with voting by mail, ""you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.""
Voting fraud in general is considered to be rare, although voting experts agree that the risks are greater for mail balloting than for in-person voting. Still, Trump didn’t produce any evidence for the ""thousands and thousands"" claim, and voting experts said his assertion doesn’t square with what is known about the actual cases of voting fraud in the recent past.

DeSantis provided no details in his speech, but he was referring to his effort in January to get Trump to extend the amount of time the federal government would pick up the tab for debris removal and emergency protective measures from five to 45 days. DeSantis got a verbal commitment from Trump to make that happen, but we were unable to confirm that with FEMA.
A spokeswoman for DeSantis says the ""historic commitment"" is that such an extension is unusual for Florida. But we found that it’s not unusual for the president to tack on extensions even for months that the federal government will pick up the entire tab.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

Teske did express concern about giving an advantage to Democrats because of her belief that the site would be in area with more voters who support Democrats, and because the site was requested by a Democratic state lawmaker.
But Teske also cited other reasons for not supporting the campus site for early voting -- including a lack of funding, a concern for ballot security and a concern for a state law that prohibits offering a satellite site that gives an advantage to any political party.
Ultimately, the city decided not to open any satellite sites for early voting for the Nov. 8, 2016 election.

On Feb. 10, three people from China were apprehended at the border and two had a fever. All three were taken to a local hospital for assessment and were medically cleared for travel. None of the individuals were quarantined at the station.
Kirk’s tweet gets some things right, but includes inaccurate details, like the number of people with symptoms and whether individuals were quarantined. He also leaves out the conclusion of this saga: None of the people had coronavirus.

Defendants facing this charge will be released as they await trial. We know from New York City arrest data that there are cases where this is the top charge at the time of arrest. In cases where the judge deems a defendant to be a flight risk, some pretrial supervision outside of a jail can be imposed. If a defendant is charged with this and certain other, more serious child pornography charges, bail may be imposed.

"""The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own.”","Biden said that from the start, the Second Amendment ""limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own.""
The Second Amendment limited government power, not the rights of individuals. Laws at the time that limited firearm ownership were primarily racist, aimed at controlling Black people and Native Americans.
Broadly, gun regulation came decades after passage of the Second Amendment when gun technology changed. The first national gun regulation law did not rely on the Second Amendment.

Says a warning label on a box of disposable masks shows that they are ineffective at protecting against the spread of COVID-19.,"A photograph of a box of disposable masks shows a warning label that says the masks ""will not provide any protections against COVID-19.""
Such disclaimers don’t mean that the masks are ineffective at slowing the spread of the disease, but that they don’t protect the wearer as well as medical respirators such as the N95 recommended for use by health care professionals. Disposable and homemade cloth masks are recommended for people to wear because it protects others around them in case they have the virus and may not be showing any symptoms.

Says Joe Biden has driven the current coronavirus surge because he “imported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border.”,"DeSantis said Biden has driven the current coronavirus surge because he ""imported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border.""
The available evidence shows that coronavirus hot spots tend to be clustered either far from the border or on the water, whereas the entire land border with Mexico has fairly low rates. The hotspot locations tend to correlate with low rates of vaccination among the public.
In addition, the U.S. does not have a ""wide open"" border. Most people who are encountered are turned away under a Trump-era policy that Biden continued.

At the time of Trump’s comments the process of counting legal ballots continued in a handful of states with close races. Election experts say that local election officials are proceeding by following their state laws to count and verify ballots.

"""The reason why Cubans don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba.""","Rubio said that rather than the U.S. embargo, the reason why Cubans ""don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba.""
""Illegal"" is probably the wrong word. There are some ways to legally access the Internet in Cuba, but not in one's home, or on mobile devices, and not by connecting to the full World Wide Web. Internet use is primarily restricted to government-run access points that are heavily monitored. The usage rates, set by the regime, are so expensive that it is cost prohibitive for most Cubans to log on. Political dissenters are barred from publishing online and are punished if they do. The end result is similar to full prohibition: Cuba has one of the lowest rates of Internet access in the world.
The U.S. sanctions have played a role in limited availability of technology. However, Rubio is right that the Cuban government has nearly complete control over the Internet. That isn’t a result of sanctions on telecommunication business activity in Cuba. Even if the United States fully repeals its embargo, government control over Internet access could continue.
We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly True.","['Is access to the internet in Cuba restricted?', 'Is internet use completely illegal in Cuba?', ""Does U.S. sanctions affect Cuba's access to the internet?

Maher based his ISIS estimate on a widely reported estimate, though the White House has downgraded the official estimate a bit.
It’s Maher’s tally of surrounding armies that needs more explanation. He's including reservists — not just active military and paramilitary — in his definition of ""army.""
The question of which nations to include as ""surrounding"" countries is more subjective. Maher is folding in five that don't share a border with ISIS' strongholds but nonetheless play key roles in Arab affairs.

News reports show that the evangelical preacher Lou Engle did travel to Uganda in 2010, around the time that lawmakers were crafting a bill that would have imposed the death penalty for gay sex. However, Engle did not directly contribute to the legislation. While he complimented Ugandans for their stance against homosexuality, he denounced the harsh penalties proposed in the bill.
Federal tax returns show that the National Christian Foundation contributed to Engle’s evangelical Christian group in 2009, before his trip. Documents also show that the WinShape Foundation, which is run by Chick-fil-A’s owners, donated to the National Christian Foundation in 2009, but the link between the company and Uganda’s anti-gay legislation is weak.

H.R. 1 would overhaul how congressional redistricting would work in the states that do not already have independent redistricting commissions. States currently without one would have to appoint a 15-member panel composed of equal numbers of Democrats, Republicans and independents. The law also says, broadly, that lines should not be drawn for partisan gain and that communities, if possible, should not be divided.

This metadata can be ""collected"" -- as Udall phrased it -- though it’s important to note that this data cannot be utilized directly in an investigation until a more stringent legal standard is met.
Meanwhile, common sense tells us that millions of Americans who are having their metadata collected are not involved in terrorism, further bolstering Udall’s claim.

In 2020, at the end of the Trump administration, the publicly held debt did exceed 100% of GDP for the first time since World War II. It’s down since then.
A broader measure, the gross federal debt, which includes funds lent from one part of the government to another, has been above 100% of GDP since 2012, well before Biden became president.
Changes in federal debt levels are largely driven by mandatory spending beyond the direct control of any president, and much of the rest has been initiated by lawmakers and presidents from both parties.

It showed 54 percent of Ohio registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president.

The allegations against Ellison are murkier. We know that, while in law school, Ellison wrote an  article defending Louis Farrakhan against claims that Farrakhan was anti-semitic. Ellison then went on to renounce the Nation of Islam while also addressing those criticisms head-on in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. It seems clear that while this claim contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
As to the claim that Ellison ""beats women,"" we know that Ellison has not been convicted of assault in a court of law. However, his former partner hasn’t backed down from claims that he harmed her in what was clearly a volatile relationship. Without more evidence, it is hard to rule on this matter.
