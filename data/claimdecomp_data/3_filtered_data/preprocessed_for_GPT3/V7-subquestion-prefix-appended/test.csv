"Says Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr ""would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops"" and that he took ""$36,550 from payday lenders.""With Honor says Barr ""would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops"" and that he received $36,550 in campaign donations from payday lenders.
It is true that Bar has accepted $36,550 in donations from payday lenders. But the other part is more complicated.
Barr voted for legislation that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s power over payday lending agencies, which could indirectly affect military families as the agency fields complaints from the community.
However, a 2006 law provides servicemembers protection, with a 36 percent cap on the interest small-dollar lenders could charge families.
So while the CFPB could have provided more protections to the military community than the 2006 law, the ad makes it appear as if Barr’s actions were connected to legislation specifically about veterans.
We rate it Half True.

"""New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.""Baldwin says: ""New reports show Kevin Nicholson made over $1 million advising companies that shut down Wisconsin plants and laid off 1,900 people.""An Associated Press report said Nicholson worked as a consultant for companies that laid off nearly 1,900 people since 2015, shutting down plants in Wisconsin and other states.
And it says Nicholson received more than $1 million for his consulting work between January 2016 and November 2017. But it doesn’t say how much he was paid for consulting for the companies that did layoffs and shutdowns.
In short, Baldwin cites no evidence to show how much money Nicholson was paid consulting for those companies. And we don’t know whether Nicholson’s work had anything to do with the layoffs and the shutdowns. There’s simply no evidence of what he did for those companies.

"""Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap.""Warren said, ""Donald Trump said he was excited for the 2008 housing crash that devastated millions of American families, because he thought it would help him scoop up more real estate on the cheap.""
We haven't seen any evidence that Trump said he was excited about the crash once it happened, and Warren's office did not provide any.
However, the existing evidence predates 2008, and it shows that Trump didn't think a crash was going to happen at all. He did make it clear that he would try to take advantage of a downturn in the housing market, but any good investor would try to do that.
Warren’s statement puts Trump’s comments in the wrong context, but she has a point about his buying philosophy. Warren's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

We don’t send them back.""
His claim is problematic on two fronts.
First, those who make a ""credible fear"" claim are not simply brought into the United States. Rather, there is an extensive review process and, in some cases, asylum cases can take years.
Second, statistics show that many have their cases rejected and are sent back -- including nearly 90% of those from Mexico.
That said, the scenario Johnson lays out can happen with unaccompanied children who arrive at the border -- for example if they fail to show up for their hearing and disappear into the country instead.

"“When we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out.”Bloomberg said, ""When we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out.""
The reduction Bloomberg touted is based on a comparison of data from the beginning of 2012 and the end of 2013, the end of his time in office.
But as Bloomberg himself acknowledged, stop and frisks had ballooned before that period under his watch. The declines toward the end of his tenure came as the city faced public criticism over the policy and a lawsuit that questioned the legality of the police behavior and its impact on minorities. So while there was ultimately a sharp decline, Bloomberg had presided over a sharp increase in stop and frisks for most of his time as mayor.

"Universal background checks involve asking people ""to submit the serial numbers to their guns to a state or federal official,"" and that violates the Second Amendment.Fitzgerald says universal background checks would involve asking people to submit their guns’ serial numbers to the government, which would violate the Second Amendment.
The serial numbers that are submitted for background checks don’t end up in government hands for years or decades. And then the federal agency is barred from fashioning them into a database.
What’s more, there is no evidence such a requirement would violate the Second Amendment, since several states have gun registries that have not been struck down by the courts — and a similar provision was upheld by federal courts in a Washington, D.C. case.

It’s fair to say that letters written on behalf of criminal defendants facing sentencing cover a range. Vukmir’s letter to the judge in Kramer’s case is limited to Kramer’s character. It doesn’t go as far as some letters in such cases that explicitly ask for leniency or lighter treatment, such as probation rather than jail.
But while the word leniency might mean different things to different people, it’s clear that Vukmir’s letter was written to benefit Kramer — in other words, seeking a lighter sentence, rather than a harsher one.

It’s broadly accepted that lack of Wall Street regulation played a role, and it’s arguable that income inequality helped set the conditions.

"Says Hillary Clinton has been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that ""treat women horribly ... and countries that kill gays.""Trump said that Hillary Clinton has ""been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly...and countries that kill gays.""
Trump's comment oversimplifies donations to the Clinton Foundation to make a quick attack against his Democratic rival. He makes it sound as if Clinton personally received money from foreign governments with poor records on human rights. But political candidates cannot accept donations from foreign governments.
However, several countries with harsh rules for women and that kill gays have contributed to the Clinton Foundation both before and after her tenure at the State Department.
We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

"""Why did the US (NIH) in 2017 give $3.7m to the Wuhan Lab in China? Such grants were prohibited in 2014. Did Pres. Obama grant an exception?""Giuliani said that in 2017, the United States gave $3.7 million to the lab in Wuhan at a time when such a grant was prohibited.
The grant was made in 2014, and the amount that went to the lab was a bit under $600,000.
The grant restriction did not apply to identifying naturally occurring viruses, which is what the Wuhan lab did.
We rate this claim False.

"""Many state and federal agencies have such ‘navigators’ involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example -- even buying health insurance.""Seeking to assuage concerns about Obamacare navigators, Nelson said, ""Many state and federal agencies have such ‘navigators’ involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example - even buying health insurance.""
Let’s review our findings:
There are differences in terms of some of the requirements and training to become an Obamacare navigator versus those who provide assistance for some of these other programs. However Nelson didn’t say they are identical: He said that we already have such ‘navigators’ to help Floridians access services.
We rate this claim True.

"""There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone"" that the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, were ""spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on.""Rubio said on CNN, ""There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on.""
There was some initial confusion about what sparked the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. Although investigations showed that some officials thought it was a terrorist attack immediately, there at least appeared to be some question about whether the video could have played a role.
Rubio exaggerates when he said there wasn’t a ""single shred of evidence."" There were several suggestions that it was because of a protest. However, he has a point that much of the early evidence pointed strongly to terrorism. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.

"Pollsters say ""don't actually believe our own data"" and Gallup stopped primary polling ""because they don't trust their methodology.""Deace said pollsters are warning people not to trust their results and that Gallup doesn’t trust its methodology. The articles he cited actually were more specific than he suggested. Pollsters did say that surveys can’t be used with surgical precision to separate the wheat from the chaff in the crowded Republican field. But that’s in response to broadcasters who have counted on polls to decide who should appear in debates.
As for Gallup, a news article implied that concerns over methodology drove its decision to stop tracking the primaries, but the editor-in-chief at Gallup didn’t say that and in fact, he expressed confidence in the firm’s techniques.
It’s costing more and more to do polling well, and state-level polls, which are the ones Deace had in mind, face the biggest challenges. But overall, Deace exaggerated what pollsters have said.
We rate this claim Half True.

"""For people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going up about $5,000 because the fact is, they will pay more in new taxes"" for Medicare for All.Biden used an unusual level of specificity in describing how Medicare for all would affect families making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year.
Those numbers don’t come out of thin air, but they are based on too many assumptions to be reliable. And they don’t accurately reflect what we know about what this plan would cost, or the extent to which it proposes specific new taxes.
This claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts and assumes more than the evidence warrants. We rate it Mostly False.
sub-questions:","1. Will taxes go up, because of Medicare for All, for families making between $50,000 and $75,000?

Today, he said he wanted to ‘beat the living crap out of’ his Republican opponent during their debate, at a campaign rally in Marmet.#WVSen""
This uses a portion of Manchin’s remarks, leaving out the fact that Manchin had prefaced that comment by saying, ""It took every bit of my discipline not to"" beat up Morrisey. That said, even the substance of what Manchin did say conflicts with a high-profile civility pledge he made in February 2018.

"""Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President"" the online charter school ECOT ""was caught and is out of business.""Faber said, ""Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President"" the online charter school ECOT ""was caught and is out of business.""
Faber was referring to House Bill 2, which passed in 2015 and required online schools to keep accurate and accessible attendance records.
But Faber is overstating credit by hanging the demise of the school on that bill. The key change that led to the school shutting down was when the education department decided to require e-schools to provide student log-in data. This showed that that the school couldn’t account for many of its supposed students, leading the state to conclude the school owed $80 million. Faber doesn’t get credit for that.
The only kernel of truth here is that the bill that passed under his leadership was another affirmation by the state that e-schools had to provide attendance data.
We rate this claim Mostly False.

"“Pfizer and Moderna could share their design with dozens of other pharma companies who stand ready to produce their vaccines and end the pandemic.”A post claims the COVID-19 vaccine shortage doesn’t need to exist because Pfizer and Moderna can share their vaccine designs with ""dozens"" of other pharmaceutical companies that are ready to produce the vaccines and end the pandemic.
This premise oversimplifies the vaccine manufacturing process.
First, the post doesn’t mention that Pfizer and Moderna already have partnerships with various contract manufacturers to help speed up vaccine production. Second, industry experts say it’s highly unlikely that ""dozens"" of other pharmaceutical companies that aren’t already producing the vaccines stand ready to do so. Supplies, personnel training and facility compliance are just a few aspects that make the process complex and lengthy.
So while such partnerships are clearly an asset to rapid vaccine production, they are not entirely practical in the grand sense that this tweet implies.
The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.
sub-questions:","1. Are Pfizer and Modern generally able to share their design with other pharma companies to reproduce their vaccine?
2. Are both Pfizer and Moderna refusing to share their design with other pharma companies?

"""We’ve been down this road before—blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression.""Sasse said, ""We’ve been down this road before — blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression.""
While the downturn that became the Great Depression had been under way for about half a year by the time the United States passed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, economists agree that the resulting trade war worsened the impact on both the global and domestic economy.
Sasse was cautious to say that the tariffs were ""a big part"" — rather than the only reason — for the Great Depression. So we rate his statement True.

"If protesters blocking the road “start banging on your windows, threatening you and trying to get in your vehicle,” it is legal to “hit the gas and plow through them.”A Facebook post claimed that if protesters blocking the road ""start banging on your windows, threatening you and trying to get in your vehicle,"" it is legal to ""hit the gas and plow through them.""
Experts said such use of deadly force would be legal only if the driver feared for their life and using the vehicle was proportionate to the amount of force being used against the driver.
The statement is overly broad. We rate it False.
sub-questions:","1. Is it legal to use your vehicle against protesters if those protesters are threatening you?
2. Is it always legal to hit protestors with your car if they are threatening you/trying to get in your car?

Paul definitely has a point. Adams’ writings clearly show that he believed the writs of assistance case was a key, early turning point of the revolution that began 15 years later. But even if it was one cause, it wasn’t the only one. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

"Speaking of his restriction on travel from China, “I had (Joe) Biden calling me xenophobic. … He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.”Speaking of his restriction on travel from China, Trump said, ""I had Biden calling me xenophobic. ... . He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in.""
Biden has not directly said that the restrictions were xenophobic. Around the time the Trump administration announced the travel restriction, Biden said that Trump had a ""record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering."" Biden used the phrase ""xenophobic"" in reply to a Trump tweet about limiting entry to travelers from China and in which he described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus.""

"“Cops in Norway: require 3 years of training, 4 people killed since 2002. Cops in Finland: require 2 years of training, 7 people killed since 2000. Cops in Iceland: require 2 years of training, 1 person killed since ever. Cops in the U.S.: require 21 weeks of training, 8,000+ people killed since 2001.”A Facebook post compared the number of fatal gun-related police encounters and the length of police training in three Nordic countries and the U.S.
""Cops in Norway: require 3 years of training, 4 people killed since 2002. Cops in Finland: require 2 years of training, 7 people killed since 2000. Cops in Iceland: require 2 years of training, 1 person killed since ever. Cops in the U.S.: require 21 weeks of training, 8,000+ people killed since 2001.""
The numbers in this claim were partly accurate. Finland’s police training takes longer than two years, and it had two more police-related deaths. The claims about U.S. policing were the most inaccurate. Police academies and departments usually require more than 21 weeks of training and estimates for fatal police shootings point to about 20,000 deaths in the past 20 years.
What’s missing most from the post, however, is context. The rate of gun violence and gun ownership is higher in the U.S. than in these other countries. Research has also shown that fatal police shootings are the result of a combination of factors and are not limited to time spent in police training alone. Experts say there needs to be structural U.S. policing reform, not just more time spent intraining.
We rate this claim Half True.
Correction, June 22, 2020:Finland has a high homicide rate compared to mostNordic countries, but it does not have the highest homicide rate in Europe. Homicides in the U.S. are four times as high as in Finland's, according to 2017 data. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on these two points.

"Says Robert E. Lee opposed slavery and secession and has come to symbolize both slavery and secession.A Facebook post says Robert E. Lee opposed both secession and slavery.
It’s accurate that Lee publicly opposed secession and wished for the country to remain intact. However, citing loyalty to his home state of Virginia, he assumed the command of the Confederate Army, which fought in favor of secession and in the defense of slavery.
Lee made statements at the end of the war that he was eager to do away with the institution of slavery. But his actions as a slave owner and his political positions contradict the claim that he opposed it.

"Quotes Valerie Jarrett as saying she is an ""Iranian by birth"" and seeks to ""change America to be a more Islamic country""An old rumor claims former White House senior adviser to President Obama, Valerie Jarrett, said in the ’70s that she is an ""Iranian by birth"" and seeks to ""change America to be a more Islamic country.""
No record or evidence can be found of Jarrett ever saying this and no media organization has ever reported on the brazen statement.
Also, Jarrett has never identified as Muslim in all her years in the public and private sphere. While she was born in Iran, her parents are American, and she has lived in the U.S. since she was five years old.

Hightower’s point is roughly related to available research. But he did not describe it correctly.
He oversimplified research findings of the Mobile County District Attorney’s office about school suspensions.
The office learned kids from 1,200 households were responsible for 75 to 80 percent of school infractions in Mobile’s public schools. It did not go so far as to examine the role of the families in those households.
Also, it’s important to know the research was from 2003, and we don’t know if the percentage still holds up. And importantly, the study centered on school suspensions and not ""crime,"" in a literal or legal sense.

Holding was correct about Ellmers’ conspicuous break from party ranks. But his description of the amendment was a bit misleading, since anyone convicted of a felony for a sex crime was already prioritized for deportation.
Ellmers has also long said she voted against the bill due to fears that it would lead to less reporting of domestic violence. That’s a key piece of context that was missing from Holding’s assessment of her record.

"Says he’s a ""small-town supervisor who has kept a balanced budget, who has increased surpluses, who has led us to the highest credit rating our town has ever had.""McMurray made three claims about his record of managing Grand Island’s finances.
It’s fair to point out that Grand Island’s strong financial position is the result of years of sound management, not only changes made since McMurray took office in 2016, Barton said.
""He’s been continuing the things that have been in place from before,"" the town accountant said.
Still, his claim about keeping a balanced budget is true.
McMurray’s claim about increasing surpluses is mostly true. The town had more surplus funds at the end of 2017 than it did when he took office, though it decreased slightly in his second year in office.
His claim that the town has the highest credit rating it has ever had is true, based on all available information.

This is an oversimplification.

"Says ""Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate . . . a status of forces agreement.""Pence said Clinton failed to negotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq. It is accurate to say that negotiations failed. However, the claim suffers from a number of flaws.
It puts too much emphasis on Clinton’s role, when the key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.
The Obama administration wanted to insulate American troops from legal action in Iraq. That was a political minefield in Iraq. While there is room for debate on whether American negotiators could have found a way around that problem, there is no reason to believe the administration simply walked away from a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq.
The claim has an element of truth, but it leaves out much key information that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"""Ida B. Wells refused to give up her seat 71 years before Rosa Parks did. At age 33, she owned the first African American newspaper in Chicago, the Chicago Conservator. Why do you never hear about her? Because she was a Republican.""The Facebook post gets these things right: Wells refused to give up her seat 71 years before Rosa Parks did, and she owned the first African American newspaper in Chicago in her early 30s.
But the post also said that people never hear about Ida B. Wells because she was a Republican. That’s not true.
Wells ran for a seat in the Illinois Senate as an independent but she was the child of Republicans and supported Republicans. African Americans were largely partial to the Republican Party during Reconstruction. Historians note it’s not the Republican Party of today, though it bears the same name.
Though Wells may not have received enough credit for her journalism and activism through much of history, the record shows that she hasn’t been invisible. When she was overshadowed at points in history, it doesn’t appear that it was due to her political affiliation but rather that she was writing in detail about lynching at a time when the African American voice and experience, and especially the African American female voice and experience, was devalued in a society dominated by white men. Today, Wells has several namesakes and markers to her legacy. McFerren suspects she gets the most attention of her contemporaries of the 1800s.

The vaccine has not yet been authorized for children under 12 because more data collection is needed, though health officials expect it will be approved this fall or winter.
Elder’s overall statement would have been more accurate had he said the science on the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 12 is incomplete. Instead, he claimed the science suggests young people in general should not be vaccinated, which is wrong.

This is wrong. Wildfire smoke particles come in a range of sizes, experts said, and some are comparable to COVID-19 particles.

It's true that Vermont would be the first state in the country to actually put a right to medical monitoring in state statute.
Vermont would not be alone in allowing for medical monitoring ahead of a disease. Sixteen states have allowed for medical monitoring claims, while 13 state have rejected those claims. Some courts lay out more stringent criteria for medical monitoring tests, based on significance of exposure, extent of increased risk and seriousness of latent disease.
However, not all courts include those qualifiers in their tests for medical monitoring. S.37 also sets limits on what types of businesses could be sued for medical monitoring in a way that other courts have not done. And a judge in a Vermont federal court has issued a preliminary ruling that could set an arguably less strict threshold for medical monitoring claims than S.37.

As a group, the patients getting the drug were not on the verge of death. Across three studies, about 75% to 80% of the patients receiving the drug survived.

The post is unclear and omits important context. USPS said in a postcard in September that voters who want to have their ballots counted in the Nov. 3 general election should request the mail-in ballot at least 15 days before Election Day and return it at least seven days before Election Day. But states set deadlines for receiving mail ballots, and many jurisdictions allow voters to bypass the mail and return ballots in official ballot drop boxes or drop off sites.
It’s a good idea to return a ballot as soon as you can, but if you want to know the actual deadline for your state, check in with your state or local elections office.

The process of putting that report together didn’t start until months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to restrict the investigation to those three agencies.
Here’s what Clapper said, according toCongressional Quarterly. (""ICA"" refers to the January 2017 ""intelligence community assessment."")
""Additionally, I'll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. And of course my direct official knowledge of any of this stopped on 20 January when my term of office was happily over.
""As you know, the (ICA) was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term.""
The January report presented its findings by saying ""we assess,"" with ""we"" meaning ""an assessment by all three agencies.""
The October statement, on the other hand, said ""The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident"" in its assessment. As we noted in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not independently come to this conclusion, but as the head of the intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on behalf of the group.
We stand by our rating.
sub-questions:","1. Is there an exact number for the investigations into these attacks?

"""Studies even show that when women go to Congress they get more things done - more bipartisan effort, more bills passed.""Gillibrand said studies show that when women are elected to Congress, they get more things done, are more bipartisan and pass more bills.
Studies show women sponsor more bills, secure more discretionary spending for their constituents, and under certain circumstances, reach across the aisle more. In the Senate, women have been more successful than men at passing bills. Studies also show that when women are elected, they work harder than their male colleagues.

"""If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks.""Warren said, ""If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump’s checks.""
This is a misreading of both federal and actual practice. Federal law requires broadcast networks to run political candidate ads without vetting them for lies or falsehoods. The same law does not apply to cable networks, but those networks also generally aim to run such ads, experts told us.
Warren does have a point that federal law does not apply to online social networks such as Facebook, so Facebook can take candidate ads regardless of whether they include falsehoods.
But overall, it’s inaccurate to say that ""most networks"" will refuse to air an ad by Trump with a lie in it. We could find no evidence that most networks reject false candidate ads.

"Says Bernie Sanders would “go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.""Buttigieg said that Sanders would ""go beyond reform and reorder the economy in ways most Democrats — let alone most Americans — don’t support.""
In reality, polling consistently shows that most Democrats do approve of key parts of Sanders’ economic agenda, including single-payer health care, the Green New Deal, tuition-free college, student debt forgiveness, a $15 minimum wage, breaking up big banks, and paid family leave. And for each of those issues except single-payer health care, a more modest percentage of all Americans — but still a majority — signal their support.
It’s important to note, however, that support levels by all Americans drop significantly once voters are informed about the policies’ costs, often to majority disapproval. And on health care policy, Buttigieg’s plan — the public option to buy into Medicare — is more popular than Sanders’ single-payer proposal is, both among all voters and among Democrats.

"""Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the U.S.) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa.""House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed ""Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the US) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa.""
Past fact checks found this statement and ones like it are generally correct. But they cautioned that the claims mainly rely on figures from a 2006 report, which used federal immigration data from the mid-1990s.
More recent Department of Homeland Security reports don’t offer the full picture of foreign visitors who arrived on visas.
A 2017 report by the Center for Migration Studies, however, gives a more current look at visa overstays. It shows McCarthy’s claim, while it should have been couched as an estimate rather than a statement of fact, is on the right track.
It projects overstayers were 42 percent, or nearly half, of the country’s undocumented population in 2014.
Finally, with the decline in illegal border crossings, it’s fair to estimate that visa overstayers now account for an increasing share of the country’s undocumented population.

"Says “Property crime rising in Austin. This is the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police. Residents are left to fend for themselves.”Abbott’s tweet made two factual claims: that property crime in Austin is on the rise and that this increase is causally linked to the city’s police budget cuts.
He based the first on figures presented in a KVUE article that cited an 11% increase in burglaries so far this year. However, property crime on the whole is not rising this year. In fact, it has dropped by 2% compared to last year. Although property crime increased slightly in 2018 and 2019, property crime has dropped significantly over the past decade.
The article Abbott referenced also cited data that showed crime rates as of August, which is before cuts to APD’s budget took effect on Oct. 1.
The second part of his claim, that increased property crime is ""the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police,"" appears to be based on assumption. Researchers have demonstrated how numerous intervening factors confound the relationship between police force size and crime. Rather, strategic crime deterrent strategies are seen as having a more direct impact on crime rates.

"Three white former police officers were sentenced to less prison time — combined — for killing three Black people than a Black man was for selling marijuana.An Instagram post claims the combined prison sentences of three white, former police officers convicted of murder were significantly less than what a Black man received after being convicted for selling marijuana.
Thompson, a Black man, was sentenced to up to 60 years for firearms possession by a felon. The sentence for the drug charge was up to 15 years. He served more than 20 years in prison before his sentence was commuted in 2020.

Sinema voted against the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, which would have allowed companies to charge individuals 50 and over up to five times more than what they charged younger adults.
Sinema’s ad glosses over a few important points. The bill’s provision only applied to people who bought insurance through the individual and small-group markets. It wouldn’t have applied to people on Medicare (and are 65 and older) or with coverage through larger employers.
The current health care law allows insurers to charge this age group three times as much for insurance as younger adults. Although Sinema's tweet references a ""new"" age tax, it may be unclear to some that the charges wouldn’t be fives time more than the current situation.

The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator, who ruled the teacher had been fired improperly and gave the teacher back his job. And two courts upheld the arbitrator’s decision.
The importance of the endangering standard was underlined by the fact that the Legislature later made sure to take that clause out.
The attack on Evers is partially accurate, but leaves out important details  — our definition of Half True.

The quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierre’s words out of context.
His full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school.
In 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRA’s agenda.

Although Walker got the first two numbers straight from a Doctors Without Borders report, his suggestion that the violence occurred because of existing border conditions was highly misleading. The statistics came from a survey that asked Central American migrants receiving medical treatment in Mexico about their experience traveling through Mexico. Also, the head of the group behind the report said violence in their home countries was a factor in why they left.
The third statistic Walker cited was also misleading, since he conflated the 19,313 minors apprehended at the border last month with the much smaller number of minors who would have been caught traveling with smugglers.

The city recorded 19 murders in the first five months of 2020, and 33 murders in the same five-month span of 2021, which is a 74% increase.
However, experts say that because these crime totals are low numbers, using percent change comparisons can easily mischaracterize or distort increases.
Roy also connects elevated crime levels to the Police Department’s reduced budget. But it’s difficult to draw a direct causal relation between police budget changes and crime stats, and Roy doesn’t provide any evidence.

So while it contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

2. Did Warren mention tonsil surgery in the context of abortion?
3. Was Warren's original statements regarding these two procedures edited in this claim?

"Says Ronald Reagan said immigrants ""brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again.""A Becoming American Initiative ad claimed Ronald Reagan said immigrants ""brought with them courage and the values of family, work, and freedom. Let us pledge to each other that we can make America great again.""
The ad is based on a 1980 Labor Day campaign speech in New Jersey, where Reagan lauded immigrants’ contributions, while also listing his grievances with Carter and his own vision for America.
Reagan didn’t say immigrants ""made America great"" verbatim, but he did imply it. The ad cuts out some of Reagan’s words to make the comments appear adjacent. We rate Becoming American Initiative’s statement Mostly True.

"“Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing.""Lightfoot said, ""Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing.""
At the time Lightfoot made her statement, Illinois did lag a majority of states nationally in terms of the share of its population that had been tested for COVID-19, according to data compiled by an independent reporting project.
But the same dataset shows Illinois tested — and continues to test — more residents per capita than the states it borders.
We rate Lightfoot’s claim Half True.
HALF TRUE– The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"Says Joe Biden’s order stopping the Keystone pipeline “made oil more expensive for us to use.”A Facebook post claimed Biden’s order stopping the Keystone XL pipeline ""made oil more expensive for us to use.""
We found no evidence to support the claim that Biden’s order has made oil more expensive for consumers. Spot market prices for benchmark products fell slightly in the days after the order.
As for the future impact, some experts said that without the pipeline project, Canadian oil producers would face higher costs to transport oil, which could raise consumer prices.
But most of the experts we spoke with said they didn’t expect the higher transport to affect U.S. buyers, since the Canadian oil was mostly destined for export and producers would face competitive pressure to absorb the added transport costs rather than passing them along. They also say transportation costs are a small factor in the cost of oil products.
We rate the statement Mostly False.

"Says Donald Trump ""was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said back in 2006, ‘Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.’ ""Clinton said Trump was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. While Trump did not welcome the tragedy of foreclosures for millions of Americans, he did speak optimistically about the opportunities the overall situation created for an investor such as himself.
Clinton’s statement leaves out that nuance, but in large measure, it matches Trump’s words. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"Says Ron Johnson justifies his support of trade agreements by saying the U.S. has the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for displaced workers, but then he ""voted to eliminate it.""Feingold said Johnson had referred to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to defend his position on trade agreements — but had voted against the TAA.
However, Johnson referred only generally to worker ""protections,"" not to the TAA specifically. He did vote against reauthorizing the program in 2011 and also voted around the same time to pare down funding, which would have had the effect of cutting a career training program.
Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""
That fits here.

"Says his elections proposal would allow ""a potential of 168 hours (of early voting), which I think is the most we’ve ever had.""Scott said that his proposal would allow ""a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we’ve ever had"" for early voting. He’s right that his proposal would give supervisors of elections the option to offer 168 hours of early voting, and that would be a record.
We should note that supervisors would also have the option to only offer 48 hours of voting, which is less than previous law. But Scott was very careful with his wording, noting that 168 hours was the maximum and outlining the specific days and hours.
A claim from his critics, Pink Slip Rick, said the law ""only mandates 48 hours of early voting."" We rated thatMostly True, because it didn't leave open the possibility of more hours. Scott's statement, on the other hand, specifically notes that the 168 hours are a maximum.Scott chose his words carefully and precisely. We rate his statement True.

Canon was referring to bills Ryan solely sponsored and is on target by that measure. But the claim suggests Ryan has been an unproductive lawmaker. Another tool out there provides a better view, but — like Canon — ignores legislation Ryan helped author but didn’t solely sponsor.
For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

"""In 2009 … Hillary Clinton was at the State Department working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents.""Camp said, ""In 2009 ... Hillary Clinton was at the State Dept working with U.S. corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents.""
Leaked cables show that the U.S. Embassy in Haiti opposed the minimum wage hike that the Haitian parliament passed in 2009, and discussed the issue with business groups.
However, the cables do not contain conclusive evidence that the State Department actively pressured Haiti to block the increase nor do they prove that Clinton personally played a role.
We rate Camp’s claim Half True.
Update, April 21, 2016:After we published this fact-check, the State Department told us it had no public, official position in the Haitian minimum wage debate.
""The U.S. Department of State did not officially oppose or support the three-step proposed minimum wage increases in Haiti – in 2009, 2010, and 2012 – as this was an internal matter,"" a spokesperson said.
The State Department’s public stance does not alter the content of the memos, however. They show that U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti clearly opposed the wage increase.

"""The candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.’ ""Rauner said Democratic gubernatorial ""candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, ‘The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.'""
Rauner’s ""controlled by Madigan"" tag is aimed at the three highest-profile candidates, Pritzker, Kennedy and Biss, and suggests without proof they are all acting at the behest of the powerful House Speaker.  All three have advocated for a change from a flat income tax rate to a graduated-rate system in which tax rates are higher for those with higher incomes.
Despite Rauner’s examples, a progressive income tax system does not necessarily mean a tax increase for the middle class. And there is no evidence that anyone in Illinois politics has a blueprint for income and tax brackets under a potential Illinois system. The closest such blueprint, from 2012, had the vast majority of voters paying the same or lower taxes.
Nor is that decision up to the governor. It would take three-fifths of the General Assembly and a majority of voters to bring a progressive tax to reality. Recent history does not point favorably to this happening without significant Democratic gains in the Legislature.
Pritzker was squishy when discussing immediate revenue needs with Crain’s, but Rauner cites the Crain’s article as Pritzker’s solid endorsement of a ""massive tax increase.""  We rate Rauner’s statement Mostly False.

"""There’s actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail.""Cruz said a court order ""prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail.""
There’s an element of truth to Cruz’s interpretation of the 1997 Flores agreement requiring children to be released or placed in least restrictive settings. As he said, children can’t be jailed with their parents. But that’s true in any situation in which a parent is sent to jail.
However, the agreement doesn't mandate the separations occurring on the border, which have stepped up due to a Trump administration change in enforcement policy. If anything, the agreement focuses on ways to protect immigrant children and to reunite them with their families.
