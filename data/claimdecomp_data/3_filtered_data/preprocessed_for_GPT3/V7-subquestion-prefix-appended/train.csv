"""Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family.""Ocasio-Cortez said, ""Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family.""
Even taking into account rhetorical excess, her statement is off in multiple ways. Fewer than one in 20 employed Americans holds a second job of any type, and the people who might be working as much as 70 or 80 hours a week represent a tiny fraction of that tiny fraction. The rates for either statistic are not high by historical standards.
In any case, the BLS does not use either of those factors in determining the official unemployment rate.
We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

"Says the impeachment of President Donald Trump would be the first in U.S. history ""without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president who is impeached would have allegedly committed.""Gigot said if Trump is impeached, this would be the first impeachment in U.S. history ""without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president who is impeached would have allegedly committed.""
The two presidents who have been impeached, Johnson and Clinton, were not charged with violating any criminal code. But that is only part of the story: Johnson was accused of breaking a law that carried a possible prison sentence, and Clinton was accused of the crime of perjury.

New York is the hardest-hit state and yet we are getting only about $12,000 per case,""
In the first round of funding for health care providers, New York state’s providers received far less money per coronavirus case than other, less-affected states, according to a credible analysis. However, Cuomo’s tweet addressed only one part of the federal funding, and it glossed over the distinction between states and health care providers in those states. The funding source Cuomo tweeted about sends money to providers, not the state.

Radel was convicted of misdemeanor cocaine possession in Washington. If he had been charged in Florida he would have faced a felony.
Under the unlikely scenario that Radel’s future career plans include applying for a job as a Lee County school bus driver, the district’s policies state that it won’t hire anyone currently on probation or who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge within the past five years, or a felony drug charge in the past decade.
Radel’s future as a congressman may be in the hands of the voters of Southwest Florida. But Scott is correct that Radel’s drug conviction has put the brakes on him becoming a bus driver.

"Says ""Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators.""The NRCC said, ""Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators.""
The NRCC blows one of Carroll's committee votes out of proportion to make it sound like she was philosophically against this policy.
Carroll did vote to kill the orginal sex offender bill in committee, because she -- along with other Democrats -- said the bill lacked language to prevent a sex offender from creating an email address with a fake name to evade tracking. But she voted for successful passage of another tracking bill with teeth when it was in the House. It required law enforcement to verify a sex offender's email addresses, and it carried criminal penalties for anyone who provides false information about their email or other online identities.
When that bill came back from the Senate, the tougher enforcement measures had been stripped out, and Carroll voted against it.
The NRCC ad ultimately distorts Carroll's position by saying she opposed making sex offenders register their online profiles when she actually fought for tougher enforcement. We rate this statement Mostly False.
Editor's note:This fact-check originally posted with a rating of False. Shortly after publication, the NRCC pointed out Carroll's vote against the final measure when it came back from the Senate, which we did not consider. We updated the piece and revised the rating.

His information comes from a conservative think tank that had accurate numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics but used them in a way that experts say is unreliable for measuring the effect of a state law on its economy.
Greitens used correct numbers but excluded important contextual information that might give someone a different impression of the figures. We rate this claim Half True.

"""In a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion.""An ad from the Jones campaign said that Moore disagreed and dissented in a case involving the abuse of two underage girls. There is no question that Moore dissented, but the ad provides no context for what Moore disagreed with. The glaring lack of detail leaves reasonable viewers with the impression that Moore disagreed with the conviction.
That’s not what he said. He disagreed with the court’s decision not to consider a legal question of admissible evidence. Several independent law professors told us that Moore raised a valid point that was legally separate from the underlying conviction in the case.

"Says the U.S. Constitution ""doesn’t say anything about (redistricting) being fair. … it’s set up to be partisan.""Tillman said the Constitution ""doesn’t say anything about being fair,"" and later added: ""it’s set up to be partisan.""
On fairness, the Constitution aims to guarantee equal weight to each voter. But it doesn’t guarantee that the nation’s political parties will have the same odds of winning a Congressional seat.
On the set-up of the redistricting process, Tillman is right that North Carolina’s system yields itself to partisan maps. But he’s wrong to suggest that the U.S. Constitution encourages that system across the country. States have the freedom to enact their own redistricting rules, and some have attempted to tackle ""fairness"" from a lot more angles than North Carolina.

It also claims that the package will cost each household $95, and Trump borrowed money to finance it from China because his tax cuts left a trillion dollar hole in the deficit.
The USDA did recently announce a $12 billion aid package for farmers, but some would consider the labeling of it as a ""bailout"" to be misleading since farmers were not responsible for the tariffs and other factors that led to the aid package being necessary.
It’s also not fair to declare that the package would cost each household $95, since different households pay taxes at different rates.
In addition, the government isn’t directly borrowing the money to finance the aid package from China. They’re borrowing the money from the U.S. Treasury. China buys and owns Treasury securities, but those securities have a very remote connection to the aid package.

But the bill would not have restricted Congress’ ability to allocate money to the military; even the organization pushing the legislation acknowledges it would not reduce military funding; and experts agree it is a symbolic measure that would not result in funding being withheld from troops.

"Says California Republican Young Kim is ""a tax cheat"" who ""illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in,"" had ""multiple tax liens placed on her"" as a result and ""owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes.""The Cisneros campaign says Kim is ""a tax cheat"" who ""illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in,"" had ""multiple tax liens placed on her"" as a result and ""owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes.""
The IRS debt is more substantial than the property tax, but there is no information to show it has anything to do with cheating. ""Cheat"" implies motivation, and news stories have used the word to describe people who purposely violated homestead exemption laws to save on taxes -- typically saving much more than $74 a year. Nic Jordan, the Cisneros campaign spokesman, told us the campaign used the word colloquially.
Whether a mistake or not, Kim had two liens and owed $387 to the county as a result of an improperly recorded homeowner’s exemption. The law is the law, as Kim’s last opponent said. But it was a minor civil matter, and one that the current property assessor says never should have resulted in liens. Cisneros focused on the $7,000 annual reduction in the house’s assessment, not mentioning on the spoof website that it made a difference of $74 a year. This makes it sound far worse than it was.

The specific rankings vary a bit depending on what measure one uses, though by one measurement, the U.S. position is even worse than Biden said.
The general conclusion is the same: The United States used to rank near the top of the pack of industrialized countries in women’s participation in the labor force, but over the past 30 years, many other countries have leapfrogged the U.S. in that measurement, as the rate in the U.S. stagnated or even fell.
Economists say the U.S. rate has been lagging for several reasons, including a lack of government policies encouraging child care and paid leave and other countries catching up to the United States’ earlier gains in women’s educational attainment.

"Says because of Donald Trump, ""the IRS decided to stop enforcing the individual mandate that was the underpinning of the ACA. That has resulted in insurance companies all across the country jacking their rates up, explicitly because they don't believe that healthy people will buy insurance.""Murphy said that insurance companies are jacking up their rates because of the IRS’ weakened enforcement of the individual mandate under Trump.
That’s an exaggeration. The Trump administration has continued the same policies as Obama. A mandate to buy insurance is in place, but there’s not much punishment for those who refused to comply.
Murphy suggested that the individual mandate itself was key in keeping insurance rates low. In theory, the requirement invites greater diversity to the health insurance risk pool, but the IRS never had sufficient tools at its disposal to enforce it effectively.
Blaming rate increases on the IRS is too simplistic, particularly as there is no evidence of a direct link. A number of other factors are at play, including uncertainty around future health care subsidies.

Officially, it’s 1,037,000 new jobs — and it’s likely that the tax cut had some positive impact.
However, it’s questionable to suggest that job growth in the past five months has been especially strong, or that recent rates of job-creation represent some kind of turnaround from a poor performance earlier.

"District attorneys ""have advertised that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a United States citizen, so they won’t be deported.""Sessions said district attorneys ""advertise that they will charge a criminal alien with a lesser offense than presumably they would charge a United States citizen.""
District and state attorneys in Brooklyn, Santa Clara and Baltimore have issued directives for prosecutorial discretion in the handling of non-violent cases involving non-U.S. citizens (which includes immigrants living in the United States legally and illegally).
Attorneys told us that the alternative sentences are designed to help people avoid deportation for minor crimes, and that sometimes the plea deals mean the person ends up with a stricter or longer sentence, or a faster guilty plea. They also contend that they are not charging immigrants favorably over citizens, as policy consideration goes into effect after charges are made.
The Supreme Court recently recognized that deportations can represent a disproportionate punishment. A recent case found that defense attorneys must inform their clients when a plea carries a risk of deportation.

The $80 million figure is roughly accurate, but the key flaw in the statement is that NASA is not doing the same thing. As part of a policy decision made a decade ago, NASA has left the shorter distance work to the private sector while it focuses on getting to the moon and beyond.
We found a wide range of approaches and estimates of what it would cost to launch the Space Launch System on a year-in-year-out basis. The answers on the high end backed up Trump’s remark. The answers on the low end suggested he exaggerated.

The smaller errors in that statement are that Obama didn’t sign an executive order, and that when he announced the new policy, he didn’t say that he lacked the authority.
The bigger issue is that in 2010 and 2011, Obama reserved the right to enforce immigration laws selectively. His emphasis was on deporting criminals who were undocumented, rather than undocumented students or workers who presented no threat to public safety.
To be sure, Obama drove home the point many times that his hands were tied and that he had to follow the law. His words about his legal flexibility were vague and gave no hint about the DACA program, an approach that took the idea of selective enforcement to a new level.

"""Studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime.""U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris said in a recent speech that ""studies have shown Latinos are more than 40 percent less likely to call 911 when they have been a victim of a crime.""
A 2013 study by a professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois, found 44 percent of respondents (all Hispanics) agreed with the following statement:
""I am less likely to contact police officers if I have been the victim of a crime for fear that they will ask me or people I know about our immigration status.""
The study’s author called Harris’ claim ""basically on target.""
Harris leaves the impression there are multiple reports to back up her claim when she uses the phrase ""studies have shown"" in her claim.
Based on our research, and comments from her spokesman, there’s only a single report that backs this up.
In 2009, the Pew Research Center produced a report that indicates a smaller share of Hispanics would be hesitant to contact police if they were victims of a crime.
Unlike the 2013 report, the Pew study did not raise the issue of whether respondents would be concerned police would ask about their immigration status. It also took place before an increase in police involvement in immigration enforcement around the country.

"There are""thousands of Georgia workers that are misclassified as independent contractors,"" who lose benefits, including health care.Evans said that thousands of Georgia workers are misclassified as independent contractors and as a result, lose out on benefits, including health insurance.
A state Senate study said there is no solid estimate of the number of misclassified workers, but state investigators had found between 1,500 and 4,000 instances in each of the past three years, or an average of 2,800 per year. That is based on a review of about 1 percent of businesses and most reviews reveal a misclassified worker. States that have conducted more systematic studies found misclassification rates in the range of 10 to 20 percent.
The 2,800 average likely misses many instances and it’s a relatively small number, but it’s enough to support Evans’ statement.
The connection to health care is less clear, because many small employers don’t offer health insurance, nor are they required to. But Evans was careful to include health care as one of several benefits, and her claim doesn’t hinge on that element.
With that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True.

"“In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.”Trump said, ""In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.""
Sanctuary policies don’t mean that undocumented criminals get to walk free of charges, or that local officials order police to release them as standard operating procedure.
Noncitizens facing arrest still go through the criminal justice system; sanctuary policies mean that they aren’t turned over to ICE authorities after they’ve done so.
Still, many sanctuary policies include specific provisions allowing law enforcement to comply with ICE’s requests when it comes to noncitizens who have been convicted of felonies. That’s the case in both California and New York City — the two places Trump called out by name.
Media reports and ICE press releases have documented some cases in which noncitizens with serious criminal records were released by police in spite of detainer requests. But these individuals had already gone through the criminal justice system in one way or another.

"Says Jeb Bush ""not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children.""The DNC said that ""Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children.""
As Bush continues to explore running for president, he may provide more specific comments about his current views, but for now we are rating the DNC’s statement based on the evidence that was available at the time they made the statement. While in office, Bush repeatedly said that he opposed gay marriage, although he was reluctant at times to amend the state Constitution since it was already banned in state law. He also opposed gay adults adopting children. Since leaving office, Bush said that he supports ""traditional marriage,"" though he has used a softer tone when asked about it, and did so again when we asked about it. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate this statement Mostly True.

"Hospitals get paid more to list patients as COVID-19.A post shared on Facebook claims hospitals have a financial incentive to claim patients had COVID-19, saying payment is three times higher if a patient goes on a ventilator. An article the post links to includes comments from a doctor who suggests the number of coronavirus cases is being padded.
It is standard for Medicare to pay roughly three times more for a patient with a respiratory condition who goes on a ventilator than for one who does not. That has nothing to do with the coronavirus.
As part of a federal stimulus bill, Medicare is paying hospitals 20% more than standard rates for COVID-19 patients.

He appears to be talking about the TSA’s ‘no fly’ list.
Garamendi connected the right number with the wrong register. His claim has a wisp of truth in that people on the larger terrorist watch list, including the much smaller no fly list, have made more than 2,000 successful firearm purchases over the past decade.

But many jurisdictions already cooperated in such a manner before the law. The future of the law is uncertain due to a pending ruling from a federal judge regarding its legality.
In 2020, DeSantis did sign a bill to require E-Verify for public employers and their contractors, but in his comments, the governor omitted that it didn’t apply to private employers who could instead use federal forms used to verify eligibility for employment.

The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believe the number could be lower.
The $1.8 billion is reasonably accurate. The official amount is $1.7 billion.
As for ""getting nothing"" out of the deal, while some people will disagree that the United States got enough, it prevented Iran from getting enough fuel to build a bomb and allowing international inspectors. That’s more than nothing.

The ad puffs up the donations by largely including money donated from ECOT officials to DeWine’s running mate Husted when he was in the Legislature. Husted joined DeWine’s ticket for governor in December and then merged their campaign accounts.
It’s an exaggeration to state that DeWine did ""nothing"" -- but he didn’t take legal action until the education department was sued in 2016. He then filed litigation in August in an effort to recoup money.
DeWine argues that he had to wait for other actions by the court or state offices to step in, though critics say he could have been more aggressive. The warning signs about ECOT had been documented in news articles for many years, and yet the state government as a whole was slow to act.

"Says Georgia’s secretary of state won’t let the people recounting ballots check the signatures for fraud.Trump said Georgia’s secretary of state won’t allow people recounting ballots to check the signatures for fraud.
This reflects a flawed understanding of how mail-in votes work. Before a mailed ballot is counted, the voter’s signature has already been verified. In Georgia, it is verified twice.
To protect the privacy of the vote, after verification, every state separates the ballot from the signed envelope it came in. By design, there is no way to reunite the two pieces of paper.
A recount can only be a recount of ballots, and Trump and his campaign knew that months ago.

Still, the mayor’s successful push to hire hundreds of new LAPD officers and focus on community policing is generally accepted as having, at the very least, some impact on reducing crime in the city.

"Says Donald Trump's executive order ""doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families.""Baldwin says Trump's executive order ""doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families.""
The thrust of Baldwin’s statement is correct. Federal officials in charge of reunification said after the order they ""are awaiting further guidance"" on how to proceed. But in fact the order does not address reunifying the 2,300 children with their parents, which is seen as a complicated process.
The order also says, as Baldwin claims, that families entering the country without permission will continue to be detained  — together, rather than parents and children being separated. But while the families would be in custody, at various facilities, Baldwin overreaches in saying the families would be put in jails.
Baldwin’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification  — our definition of Mostly True.

"If the mayor were really serious about supporting Philly's schoolchildren and handling our city's looming fiscal crisis, he could begin by slashing the size of his own administration, which is already 45 percent larger than his predecessor's and 40 percent more costly.Republican City Committee chairman Joe DeFelice suggested Mayor Jim Kenney examine the size of his administration before enacting something like the soda tax and argued it was 45 percent larger and 40 percent more costly than his predecessor Michael Nutter’s. Those numbers match up when comparing the staffers who report to Kenney to the staffers who reported to Nutter, but the reporting structure in city government doesn’t give the whole picture.

"Voting-rights legislation proposed by Democrats in Congress called H.R. 1 “would force states to restore the voting rights of convicted felons—including violent felons convicted of murder or rape.”California Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa claimed H.R. 1 ""would force states to restore the voting rights of convicted felons—including violent felons convicted of murder or rape.""
His statement is partly correct but omits some significant points.
The proposed legislation would restore voting rights for all people convicted of a crime but only once they’ve completed their sentence and been released from incarceration.
LaMalfa also ignores the fact that the vast majority of states including California already restore voting rights for people convicted of a crime, either automatically upon their release or after a period of time.

"Eric Esshaki “would allow insurance companies to kick people with a preexisting condition off their plans in the middle of a pandemic, including over 100,000 Michiganders who have survived COVID-19.”A Haley Stevens campaign ad says her challenger, Eric Esshaki, supports a plan that would allow insurers to kick over 100,000 COVID-19 survivors in Michigan off their health care plans.
Stevens cites Esshaki’s support for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which includes protections for preexisting conditions. But Esshaki has called for waiting to repeal the ACA until there’s a replacement that maintains those protections.
Stevens’ ad also assumes that all Michiganders who have survived COVID-19 would be affected in the same way — and lose their coverage — if the ACA were repealed or overturned. That’s not the case. People in the individual insurance market would be most at risk if insurers designate coronavirus infections as a preexisting condition. But the effect on people covered by job-based group plans, Medicare or Medicaid would be more limited.

As for the Walker administration, DNR scientists are permitted to share their expertise regarding proposed legislation -- without declaring a position or commenting on the legislation itself -- by invitation only. The evidence suggests this still happens frequently, though pre-Walker staffers had more latitude in what they could say.
As for the second half of Roys’ statement, Walker has taken steps to change permit-writing processes so that businesses are more involved (and DNR officials less involved).

"""Joe Biden is proposing that any family who tries to pass a business or a farm down to their son or daughter or grandson or granddaughter are going to pay a huge new tax.""Christie said, ""Joe Biden is proposing that any family who tries to pass a business or a farm down to their son or daughter or grandson or granddaughter are going to pay a huge new tax.""
Biden is proposing a series of new taxes that could hit large inheritances in a significant way. But Christie is wrong to frame these as hitting ""any family"" passing down a business within the family.
The White House says it will explicitly rule out this possibility when the formal legislation is written.

"“They have 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine — you won’t even have a choice — they want to terminate 180 million plans.”Trump said 180 million people would lose their private health insurance plans to socialized medicine under Biden.
While about 180 million people do have private health insurance, there is no evidence that all of them would lose their private plans if Biden were elected president.
Biden supports implementing a public option on the health insurance marketplace. It would exist alongside private health insurance plans, and Americans would have the option to buy either the private plan or the public plan. While estimates show that there are a number of Americans that would likely leave their employer-sponsored coverage for the public plan, they would be doing that by choice and the estimates are nowhere near Trump’s 180 million figure.
Experts also agree that the public option is not socialized medicine, and it’s ridiculous to conflate Biden’s plan with Medicare for All.

Wooten is mostly correct on the first two charges and close to correct on the third.
Gunn co-sponsored a 2013 bill that rejected Medicaid expansion, so even if he was not solely responsible for blocking expansion, he played a role in it.

"“People are less likely to just vote for party now. … They’re looking at the personalities.”Vining said, ""People are less likely to just vote for party now. ... They’re looking at the personalities.""
Looking narrowly at Trump’s support among suburban women, there’s a case this is accurate. Trump’s abrasive approach doesn’t appear to be resonating with that group, and fewer appear likely to support him than in 2016.
But Vining’s comment was more general than that. And broadly speaking, party is playing a growing role in voters’ decisions — not a shrinking one.
Voters are less likely than in the past to cast ballots supporting candidates from multiple parties. And they’re more likely than ever to agree with people from their own party when assessing something like the president’s job performance.

While Moore has a point that guns are rarely used when someone breaks into a home, it is difficult to confirm. After interviewing several experts and agencies, we only found one study that came close to supporting Moore’s assertion about the number of home invasion deaths. Even then, the report’s author said Moore misstated the scope and specifics.
Our sources conceded that the homicide rate during burglaries is a tiny fraction of overall gun deaths, committed during burglaries or otherwise.

Californians will be required to have health care coverage in 2020, and if they don’t, they’ll pay a tax when they file their state income taxes in 2021. (There are some exemptions.)
Revenue from the penalty will be used to pay for subsidies that will become available to Californians to help them reduce the cost of health care coverage. The subsidies will be for Californians who buy insurance through Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace. Immigrants in the country illegally are not allowed to purchase insurance through Covered California.
California in 2020 will also expand health care coverage for young adults in the country illegally with low income. That’s estimated to cost around $98 million in the first year, drawing about $74 million from the state’s general fund.

Meanwhile, James’ has been clear in his stated support for overturning Roe v. Wade, an action that would result in abortion regulations reverting to individual states.

Villaraigosa’s campaign cited articles showing Newsom strongly backed the project a decade ago. It also pointed to aradio interview in 2014in which Newsom admitted that he shared the public’s growing opposition to high-speed rail. He also suggested redirecting funds away from the project, a move that the head of the project’s oversight panel said would have made building high-speed rail ""a lot more difficult.""
A spokesman for Newsom’s campaign defended the candidate’s stance, saying Newsom has scrutinized project costs as they have soared beyond initial estimates. He said, however, that Newsom has never turned his back on high-speed rail.
We found Villaraigosa pointed to key evidence, particularly the 2014 radio interview, that shows Newsom’s stance had shifted, at least for that moment in time.

Children at these facilities are under federal custody, awaiting immigration proceedings, and placement with a sponsor in the United States. So children might stay for reasons other than ""because they are well taken care of."" While most children in federal custody are 13- to 17-years-old, hundreds of others are 12 or younger.

That’s not what happened. The Obama administration gave hundreds of thousands of documents to Congress in at least four investigations. For a fraction of those documents, the administration went to court to try to head off the request, but courts generally sided with Congress, and the documents were ultimately handed over. Experts say the scenario is typical of the longstanding skirmishing between the executive and legislative branches.

However, a parent whose child attends a school operating under Plan B may hear Cooper’s comments and think the Republican bill would remove some health protocols that are already in place. That doesn’t appear to be the case.

"The Texas abortion law “provides at least six weeks for a person to be able to get an abortion.”Abbott said that the new Texas abortion law ""provides at least six weeks for a person to be able to get an abortion.""
Abbott’s statement ignores how the pregnancy timeline is calculated. Doctors count pregnancy as starting from the date of a woman’s last period.

The record shows that Blackburn was critical of the DEA and was an early leader in reining in DEA powers. It is also a matter of record that the industry spent nearly $1.3 million lobbying for those changes and increased its donations to Blackburn as the legislative process played out.
The only uncertainty concerns what prompted Blackburn’s actions, and the meaning of ""behest"" has some wiggle room. It can be both a command and a strong suggestion.

Hoadley used the term ""breeders"" to refer to straight people, not women specifically. Hoadley attended an event to learn about the impact of crystal meth on the LGBTQ community. CLF’s claim implies that Hoadley was interested in experimenting with the illegal substance. Hoadley wrote a poem that contained the line, ""I talk to the latest victim of my sexual conquest,"" but his blog post noted his writing was a piece of fiction and that he was not talking about himself. Hoadley relayed a conversation in which his friend said he ""shudders"" at the thought of a four year-old being dressed in a thong. Both Hoadley and his friend were expressing their disdain for sexualizing children.
CLF’s ad contains a small element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this ad Mostly False.

Trump never literally told women, young people, people of color and ""intelligent men,"" to stay home on Nov. 8. Clinton’s remark refers to news articles that quote anonymous sources from the campaign saying the strategy is to reduce turnout for Clinton by targeting specific groups of people, including young people, women and people of color.

"Says a new law adopted in Texas means property tax bills “are no longer really dependent on your values, it is on (local government) revenue growth.”Patrick said a 2019 law adopted in Texas means that property taxes in the state ""are no longer really dependent on your values, it is on (city and county) revenue growth.""
The bill Patrick mentioned limited how much taxing entities can increase property tax revenue before triggering an election, but it did not change the role property values play in any part of the calculation. Property values remain essential to the process.
The law’s author said the bill was more about shifting culture than changing the literal calculation for taxes, as it increases transparency and requires an automatic rollback election.
But regardless of where the bill shifted focus, property values dictate what a person’s tax bill will be each year and they are part of the equation for cities and counties when they calculate the annual tax rate.

"""The so-called ‘heartbeat’ law outlaws abortion before most women even know that they're pregnant.

He says a six-week ban prohibits abortion before ""most women"" know that they are pregnant, but there isn’t any research that conclusively says that’s correct.
Some clarification would help him here.
Most women who aren’t trying to conceive are less likely to know this early that they are pregnant. They probably aren’t taking pregnancy tests or closely monitoring their periods. And women seeking abortions are generally coming in after six weeks.

"Says federal regulation of the wolf population has led to attacks on livestock, driving down production, leading to dairy farms going out of business.Tiffany claimed federal regulation of the wolf population has led to attacks on livestock, driving down production, leading to dairy farms going out of business.
But the number of cows killed by wolves is tiny in comparison to the size of the state’s dairy industry, which has been battered by years of low milk prices, declining consumption and a host of global economic factors. What’s more, the rise in the wolf population came amid a period of growing milk production. And it’s that over supply that is helping drive down prices.

Average tax refunds are down by $170 so far this year, though that’s a preliminary number that may or may not hold up. And the wealthy do gain disproportionately from the tax changes passed in 2017, but this glosses over the projections saying that most households will see tax cuts for the first eight years or so.
However, stating these two assertions in quick succession suggests that the smaller tax refunds are evidence of the tax bill’s negative impact on middle-income taxpayers, and that’s not the case.

"Medicaid ""is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit right now. It’s the one that is in our lap because of Obamacare.""Toomey said that Medicaid is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit.
The truth is, Medicaid spending annually is about 70 percent of the size of the federal budget deficit. The same logic, if applied to defense spending, would mean defense spending contributes more than 100 percent to the deficit. Experts say both comparisons are flawed and misleading.
Blaming the Affordable Care Act for the rise in Medicaid spending isn’t entirely right either, as the majority of Medicaid spending was already in place before the law, and taxes were imposed to offset the Medicaid expansion’s strain on the deficit.

But the blame element misses the mark.
While Trump may have a slight influence over drug prices with his appointee to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, there is really no way for the administration to step in and tell Gilead to charge less for remdesivir without a change in federal laws or invoking a rarely used maneuver to effectively seize the patent from the company.

She has a point that Steyer is a billionaire and that Biden, Buttigieg, Sanders and Yang are each supported by a super PAC. Some of the super PACs started for the 2020 presidential campaign; some existed beforehand.

Saying the data came from the Justice Department is misleading. It actually came from a congressional subcommittee chaired by then-senator Sessions.
Moreover, the data had some limitations. Federal agencies did not provide information on people’s places of origin.

He did vote against the 2010 Dream Act, years after introducing similar measures in the Senate. But he supported the Dream Act in some form after the vote. He voted yes on the 2013 comprehensive immigration legislation that included pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought here as children from other countries. McCain made border security the priority before getting a Dream Act.

Gardner omits that to get to the 30 percent figure requires adding those the Director of National Intelligence says were confirmed of re-engaging and those only suspected of re-engaging. Also, the federal government provides no details in its report about how it arrives at the figures or the identity of the detainees that went back into battle.

"Says the Associated Press was wrong to report that ""Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years"" because in a ""new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades.""Brady said that the Associated Press was wrong to report that ""Income Inequality grew to largest in 50 years"" because in a ""new Census report all four measures of income inequality SHRUNK, reversing rise over past five decades.""
Brady used a different Census Bureau survey than the Associated Press to make his claim. Both surveys had slightly different findings about income inequality — a normal occurrence, according to multiple experts.
The survey the Associated Press used showed a statistically significant increase in income inequality from 2017 to 2018, using the only measurement of inequality included in the survey.
In the survey Brady cited, estimates for four measures of income inequality were generated using two different categories of income.
In one category, three of the four measures saw a statistically significant decrease from 2017 to 2018. In the other category, none of the measurements experienced a statistically significant change.
Plus, experts said year-to-year changes in income inequality are not indicative of larger trends, so it is a stretch to suggest that the 2018 figures signal a reverse in the rise over the past five decades.

"Says crime is on the rise in Austin and a new study showed that it “is the No. 1 city in America in the year-to-year percentage increase in murders, with a percentage increase of more than 64% for the first half of this year.”Abbott said crime is on the rise in Austin, which is ""the No. 1 city in America in the year-to-year percentage increase in murders, with a percentage increase of more than 64% for the first half of this year.""
Abbott’s figures are from a Wall Street Journal analysis of homicides in cities across the country, and they are reflected in reports from the Austin Police Department.
But the issue is the conclusion he is drawing from these figures. Experts said crime data of this scale (changes in small numbers over a short time period) does not accurately reflect a crime trend or the safety of a specific area.

"“(Retail) milk has gone up 7.5% since this time last year. The price farmers are paid has dropped 23%.”A viral Facebook post said retail milk prices are up 7.5% from last year while the price paid to farmers dropped 23%.
The farmer who provided these numbers was just referencing payments for the milk he sold and prices at a local grocer, but the trends are in line with what we see nationally.
Nationwide, retail milk prices in April were up nearly 10% from the prior year, while the price paid to farmers dropped sharply in May to about 21% below the prior year.

It’s worth noting some of the context that Morrisey left out -- that Clinton had also expressed empathy for coal miners’ economic challenges in her initial remark, that she later clarified what she had meant to say, and that Manchin had worked to convince Clinton of why her remarks had been unacceptable.

McCrory did ask for the money, although there’s no proof he asked for it to be taken specifically from disaster relief – an especially touchy topic now with so much flooding ravaging the state.
The money is still in the disaster relief fund, which is a mark against Cooper’s claim, but nevertheless it is still earmarked for HB2, meaning McCrory could take it in the future.

"Social media posts claim the U.S. Postal Service “says you should give mail in ballots at least 14 days roundtrip. So, if you plan to vote by mail, election day isn’t November 3. It’s October 20th.”Several widely-shared social media posts suggest that Election Day for Americans who want to vote-by-mail is really Oct. 20 and not the official date, Nov. 3. They also say the U.S. Postal Service recommends allowing ""at least 14 days roundtrip"" to ensure they can request, fill-out and send back their mail-in ballots on time.
We found some of this is accurate, but not for all states.
Some allow far more time for the receipt of mail-in ballots than others. Ballots are still counted in California, for example, 17 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3. In many others, there’s no extension and ballots must be received on Election Day.
But even in states that grant less time, voters have options. They can speed things up by using a ballot drop box or returning their ballot at in-person polling locations.
Giving some credence to these posts, we found the U.S. Postal Service does recommend the early request of mail-in ballots. It says voters should do that as early as possible and no later than 15 days before the election. It also recommends returning those ballots at least a week early and contacting local election officials about deadlines.
In the end, these social media posts stretch the truth by suggesting there’s a fixed deadline of Oct. 20 to vote-by-mail in the United States. The Postal Service and elections experts encourage voters to act early, but deadlines vary by state.

"Says Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are ""responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran.""Sen. Richard Burr said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are ""responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran.""
That’s not true in a strictly literal sense, except for the fact that Obama and Clinton (and John Kerry) are responsible for the Iran deal, along with Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Iran is not being given any weapons, and in fact it is giving up some very powerful weapons it was on the verge of developing.
However, if Iran plays by the rules, it will have access in the future to weapons dealers and to billions of dollars in cash that it can’t legally access now. There’s no guarantee it will happen, but it will if everything goes according to plan. Essentially, the deal does not arm Iran but could allow Iran to better arm itself.

By focusing on the bill that officially repealed Glass-Steagall, Clinton's statement ignores the fact that the demise of Glass-Steagall took place over decades, amid a deregulatory push in which the Clinton administration played a role. By the time the law to repeal hit his desk, Glass-Steagall had been whittled down so much that it wasn’t very meaningful. It's a matter of debate how much of a role the overall demise of Glass-Steagall had in causing the financial crisis, but we couldn't find any economists who argue that the regulation was the sole linchpin keeping the financial system stable until its official repeal in 1999.

At the same time, an analysis by a conservative research organization shows that network news on ABC, NBC and CBS have made the Russia story an integral part of their Trump coverage.
But experts caution about reading too much into the network news analysis, which is limited in scope. And either way, Conway’s numbers are off by 20 percentage points.
We rate this statement Mostly False.

"“COVID internment camps announced in America: Tennessee governor signs EO authorizing National Guard to carry out COVID medical kidnappings.”A TikTok video claims that the governor of Tennessee signed an executive order allowing the National Guard to begin ""COVID medical kidnappings."" Nothing like this has happened. What did happen is that, faced with skyrocketing COVD-19 cases and limited capacity to treat these cases, the governor of Tennessee signed an executive order allowing the National Guard to help relieve strain on hospitals and medical providers by providing needed medical-related services where authorized. Nothing in the order would allow ""kidnappings.""
A CDC document cited as evidence is simply a paper that analyzed a method that aimed to protect people already living in refugee camps and other humanitarian settings who were also at high risk for COVID-19. The CDC determined that there was ""no empirical evidence"" that this approach would reduce the risk of COVID-19 and highlighted the method’s risks and challenges.

The one nation Trump exempted from his punitive ban was . . . wait for it . . . drumroll: Russia.""
The most recent set of sanctions doesn’t specifically target any entity linked to Russia. However, sanction lists are dependent on intelligence findings, and when the U.S. government had intelligence relevant to sanctions-busting, the Trump administration has slapped sanctions on Russian entities in the past.

"In first week as governor, Tim Kaine ""proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, $4 billion, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year.""Trump said Kaine, during his first week as governor, proposed a ""nearly $4 billion tax increase"" that would have hit people earning as little as $17,000.
Kaine, six days after taking office in 2006, did propose a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Trump calls it a ""nearly $4 billion tax increase,"" citing a figure used in a newspaper article at the time. But the article said that sum would be realized over four years. Trump, in using that high $4 billion figure, omits the clarifying time span.
The tax package centered on raising levies on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. It would have affected people with taxable incomes of $17,000 or lower - if they had a car.

Under the Affordable Care Act, most women don’t have to pay for birth control if its prescribed. McSally voted to repeal the health care law.
The bill McSally supports seeks to make contraceptive drugs available over-the-counter, which would increase access.

"“This is the California model spreading across the country. When you need to flip things blue there’s always some mysterious mail-in ballots lying around that’ll do the trick. Shameful!”A popular Facebook post from commentator Tomi Lahren said ""mysterious mail-in ballots lying around"" helped flip key states in the race for the White House for Democrat Joe Biden. It also suggested California’s mail-in voting system is fraudulent.
There’s no evidence that election officials discovered new or illegal ballots ""lying around"" after Election Day. Several battleground states where early results from Tuesday’s in-person vote favored President Trump continued counting legally-voted mail-in ballots Tuesday night and Wednesday. Those ballots can take longer to count and some states were prohibited from starting to tally them until Tuesday.
Additionally, Democratic votersrelied more heavily on mail-in ballots, which explains why the early results have shifted.
Election experts and county election officials along with numerous studies have rejected the idea that mail-in ballots in California or any other state lead to widespread fraud.

Walker has a point in that, after vetting the refugees and approving their entrance to the United States, the federal government does not provide lists of the names of those individuals to states. But that’s something of a red herring -- states don’t get lists of other people who are legally in the United States and are generally free to move about and reside wherever they want.

But Taylor is correct that if the bill becomes law, people could generally carry concealed weapons without getting a license -- which would mean no background check or training would be required, either. And even felons could conceal carry certain weapons, such as antique or replica guns.

Biden has not called for only a government-run plan. He has called for a voluntary public option alongside private options.
The ad leaps to conclusions about how Biden’s plan would impact hospitals and Medicare coverage, relying largely on articles by groups that oppose the public option. Experts said Biden’s plan doesn’t include enough specifics to reach conclusions, but it’s a stretch to conclude that he would put Medicare coverage at risk. The study the campaign cited about the public option leading to rural hospital closures cites a huge range and makes some assumptions and also acknowledges that rural hospitals are already closing.

"Officials “recommend that women who get one of these (COVID-19) shots should absolutely not get pregnant for at least the first two months after they’ve been injected.”Tenpenny claimed that it is recommended ""women who get one of these shots should absolutely not get pregnant for at least the first two months after they’ve been injected"" because an ingredient in the coronavirus vaccines might cause unknown problems during pregnancy.

This is a simplified description of the back-and-forth between Clinton and Obama. Both candidates said they supported more diplomacy between Iran and the United States than what the Bush administration had pursued. Clinton’s position differed from Obama’s in that she supported a slower approach, starting with lower-level talks. Obama, on the other hand, said he would be willing to meet with Iranian leaders in his first year as president, without preconditions. It was Obama’s approach to diplomacy with Iran that she called naive, not the idea of pursuing diplomatic relations in general. Ultimately, Obama did not meet himself with Iranian leaders in his first year.

"""Women earn on average 80-cents on the dollar compared to white men doing similar jobs.""Scott said, ""Women earn on average 80-cents on the dollar compared to white men doing similar jobs.""
BLS statistics support Scott, showing the median pay of white men in 2018 was higher than that of all women in each of 22 job fields listed in the data set.
We take issue with Scott’s context, however. He presents pay disparity as the product of discrimination. But gender pay is a complicated subject and there are many reasons - in addition to discrimination - why a gap exists: women tend to work fewer hours than men; they tend to choose lower paying professions than men; they tend to take more time off than men to tend to children.
Scott’s statement, and his entire speech, lack this framework. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

"Said, ""The Seven Years’ War led to near bankruptcy for many countries; Britain’s need to raise taxes fueled the American desire for independence.""Hastings is correct that the Seven Years’ War caused multiple countries, including Great Britain, to plunge into debt. In order to pay it off, Great Britain taxed the American colonies.
Hastings said revolution was ""fueled"" by this taxation. This is true, but it does miss some key context because the colonies’ lack of representation was just as important as the excess of taxation. Because they were not represented in Parliament and thus taxed without any input, the colonists felt like second-class citizens and started their battle for equality that ultimately resulted in independence.

"""FBI crime statistics have found that labeled ‘sanctuary’ cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides.""Hernandez said: ""FBI crime statistics have found that labeled ‘sanctuary’ cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides.""
Any implication the FBI reached this conclusion is wrong; the agency has not aired such findings.
Still, an outside analysis of 2015 FBI-collected crime statistics supports the idea that communities offering sanctuary to unauthorized residents have less total crime. Then again, that analysis didn't independently confirm the sanctuary status of each county nor did it fine-tune the crime statistics as much as criminologists would prefer before reaching cause-effect conclusions.

Brown’s budget proposal for this fiscal year, meanwhile, shows the corrections department is now estimated to be 9 percent of the general fund, or $12 billion.
A UC Berkeley criminal justice professor told us the governor’s spending claim rings true, noting the state’s prison population exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, driven by the state’s overall population boom, strict criminal sentencing laws and a national focus on drug crimes.

"The U.S. had 44 CDC staffers “in China to observe what was going on.

He garbled the numbers. The actual staffing went from eight Americans and 39 Chinese (47), to three Americans and 11 Chinese (14).
But within that, the American staff working specifically on new threats like COVID-19 went from four to zero.
It is unclear whether the presence of those Americans would have provided an early warning. But the former head of the CDC said it was possible, and many global health groups lobbied for the overall program to continue. The White House decided not to ask for funds to maintain that program in China.

In Florida, voters who do not indicate affiliation on their registration forms are automatically placed in the No Party Affiliation category, artificially inflating the number of seemingly independent voters. And among voters registered as having No Party Affiliation, many still vote according to partisan lines.
Still, the numbers are fairly close, and the trend is certainly spot on.

"Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals… Saving his friends millions... It’s an inside game played by people like Merry Marwig, Madigan’s hand-picked candidate.

Representing the powerful and politically connected.... When (Merry) Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense... Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.""
Merry Marwig did, in fact, get her property taxes lowered twice and it did raise other people’s taxes. But the ad’s tone and inferences are misleading to viewers.
It makes it seem like Madigan’s firm was connected to Marwig’s property value reassessment. Madigan’s firm never represented Marwig. In fact, Marwig never used an attorney during her property tax appeals.
The ad also calls the practice of appealing one’s property taxes corrupt. While there is evidence Madigan has been a highly successful property tax appeal lawyer whose clients win breaks more than many others, any citizen within the geographic boundary can file an appeal to the Cook County Assessor's Office or Cook County Board of Review. The process becomes public record. While some people may think Madigan succeeds more than average citizens, there’s no evidence the system as a whole is corrupt.

"Mergers and integration in agribusiness ""squeeze"" family farms, and ""the result is that farmers are getting a record-low amount of every dollar Americans spend on food.""Warren said that mergers and integration in agribusiness ""squeeze"" family farms and ""the result is that farmers are getting a record-low amount of every dollar Americans spend on food.""
Government data definitely show that farmers are getting a record-low share of the food dollar. In some cases, consolidation of agribusinesses has contributed to that, but the broader connection is unproven. The strongest driver is Americans’ increasing appetite for food at restaurants and prepared foods at grocery stores. When preparation costs more, the percentage going to farmers declines.

Zandi is a well-respected economist, and we are not in this fact-check casting doubt on the credibility of his Trump report or his work generally. He has advised and worked on issues for politicians on both sides of the aisle for many years.

"States are seeing increases in revenue, with an average decline of just 0.12% compared with 2019.

He also said that over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.
Scott faithfully reflects a report from J.P. Morgan in terms of the 0.12% overall decline, but he went astray when talking about states with higher revenues, particularly the three states he named. The J.P. Morgan report said revenues grew only in California. They fell in New York and Illinois.
Scott’s numbers included two months before the pandemic began. Focusing on the pandemic months of March through December, revenues fell about 10 times more than Scott said.
He also limited his view of fiscal health to state revenues. Factoring in spending cuts, and impacts on city and county finances, the picture is much worse.

"""It’s now constitutional to ban [assault weapons] in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity.""Rotering says: ""It’s now constitutional to ban these weapons of war in Illinois. Yet, the Illinois General Assembly has failed to allow other cities to have that opportunity.""
While there’s much disagreement about how to respond to the problem of gun violence, Illinois’ law on banning powerful rifles, commonly referenced as assault weapons, is clear. Only the state of Illinois — and not local governments — can pass an assault weapons ban, although local governments like Rotering’s Highland Park were granted a narrow and long-since expired window to approve their own bans.
Those provisions were included by lawmakers in a 2013 law that allowed the concealed carry of weapons in Illinois.
In claiming that the ""Illinois General Assembly has failed"" to reopen the door to local weapons bans, Rotering resorts to language that to some lawmakers seems over the top because she appears to be equating inaction with failure. But the essence of her claim is correct.
Lawmakers inclined to back Morrison’s proposal acknowledge it has lacked the votes to pass up to now. Even so, the Legislature has had the opportunity to revisit the issue and did not do so.
From that perspective, Rotering is accurate, which is why we rate her statement True.

"A Georgia law has not “criminalized giving people bottles of water.” It pertains to political organizations.Holmes said a Georgia law has not ""criminalized giving people bottles of water."" It pertains to political organizations.
SB 202 makes it a crime for people — and not just people from political organizations — to hand out food or bottles of water within 150 feet of a polling place or 25 feet of any voter standing in line.
The only kernel of truth is that the law has a sentence which allows poll workers to make available ""self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote."" But just because poll workers can make self-service water available, doesn’t mean they are required to come up with a way to make water accessible to voters in every line at every polling site. Also, people could hand out water or food to voters outside the 150-foot and 25-foot boundaries.

This is an exaggeration. People voting in line can still eat or drink. In some places, they may have to bring their own food and water.
What Harris is talking about are laws aimed at stopping organized food and water giveaways. Georgia passed a law this year that bans handing out food and water to voters in line. Montana passed a law in 2015 that bans candidates or people on their behalf from distributing food and water to voters in line. A law that passed in Florida this year bans engaging in any activity to influence a voter, but it doesn’t specifically mention handing out food or water.
It’s important to note that these laws are rare. And, they don’t literally ban eating or drinking in line; rather, they ban organized giveaways that violate anti-electioneering rules spelled out in state law.

Meadows is correct that Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS and that the Clinton campaign hired the firm to continue researching Trump. He is also right that Bruce Ohr provided the FBI a copy of the dossier.

As for property tax hikes, it’s likely that many school districts raised their levies as the broader budget impasse was ongoing. But that is routine in Illinois, a consequence of state policies that foist the lion’s share of responsibility for overall school funding on to local property tax payers.
What’s more, the ad blames Rauner alone for the budget impasse that caused the delay. But Rauner and Democratic lawmakers butted heads for two years over spending and policy priorities, meaning he hardly acted alone.
There are small elements of truth sprinkled through Pritzker’s ad, but he takes significant liberties in seeking to attach sole blame to Rauner for the budget impasse and then link that to school funding delays and property tax hikes. We rate it Mostly False.

That is wrong. The New York Times reported a much lower number for people who flew directly into the U.S. from China after Trump’s limits went into effect — around 40,000 over two months. Those travelers were American citizens and other travelers exempted from the restrictions.

The treaty hasn’t cut Russia’s nuclear arms yet. But if it does in the future, after the treaty is fully implemented in 2018, it seems that any reductions would be minimal rather than sweeping.
New START has a limited impact in that it focuses on one portion of Russia’s nuclear program: deployed strategic weapons. The treaty does place tighter limits on these weapons than any past treaty.

Ratings were down 8 percent in 2016, but experts said the drop was modest and in line with general ratings for the sports industry. The NFL remains the most watched televised sports event in the United States.
Ratings in 2017 so far suggest a similar year-on-year drop, but experts say it’s too early to tell, and external factors like Hurricane Irma, which coincided with the season’s first week, may help explain the drop.

Trump distorted the actual trade relations in many ways. While he was reasonably correct on the scale of cars imported to the United States, he cast wheat as a major part of U.S.-Japan trade. It accounts for less than 1% of sales. Trump sidestepped the top ranking items of civilian aircraft and related goods, and industrial machinery.

The United States has almost certainlyentered a recession, and the economic outlook across the country is grim, but Iowa was in a relatively good place just a month ago.
Iowa unemployment had been at a historic low since 2017, and in February it ranked 11th in the country. Employers in Iowa did have trouble finding qualified workers to fill positions.
Wage increases are less clear. Wages have gone up 3 percent in the last year, but that increase hasn’t kept pace with many other states in the Midwest. Additionally, median wages only increased 4.4 percent since 2009, and the biggest wage increases were concentrated at the top.
The poverty rate in the U.S. has been declining steadily since 2015, and in 2018 it reached pre-recession levels. We rated Whitver’s claim as True.

"“When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America.”Biden said the Trump administration ""had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America.""
While Trump was still in office, his administration had agreements in place to buy 400 million doses of authorized vaccine, or enough to inoculate about 200 million people. That’s less than the U.S. adult population.
However, KHN/Politifact reviewed the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed contracts, and found that those included enough vaccine doses that, once cleared for use by the FDA, could inoculate about 550 million people — more than double the U.S. adult population.

The meme has a point — Cruz, Rubio and Heller did submit a bill that seeks to leverage the threat of a 50 percent cut to the State Department’s ""Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance"" account in the service of forcing the executive branch to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
However, the meme goes too far in suggesting that the 50 percent cut was the purpose of the bill, and it ignores that some of the most important security funds would be untouched. The meme also ignores that essentially the same bill was introduced almost a year before the Benghazi attacks, and it incorrectly labels Heller as one of the more outspoken Republican lawmakers on Benghazi.

He’s right.
Flake’s carefully crafted statement rules out potential exceptions, such as Justice Kennedy’s 1988 election year confirmation, but 1987 nomination, or the 1950s case with President Eisenhower and a Democratic Senate in adjournment when a Supreme Court vacancy came up a month before the November election. This seems to be because a vacancy just hasn’t happened to occur under these circumstances.

Olson provided a list of 15 cases that addressed marriage as something like a ""fundamental right"" that did not specify marriage as a union between a man and woman. Several experts backed up his claim.
Until recent years, though, the Supreme Court never had to address the question of whether or not marriage should be limited to a man and woman. Because of societal norms, they assumed that the decision would be interpreted as referring to a heterosexual relationship.

Castilla is right that there is no law regulating transition-related treatment separately from other medically-necessary care and the same age regulations apply — minors need parental consent.
Widely accepted guidelines for transition care emphasize gender-affirming care and therapy as primary tools for children. More intensive options, like surgery or hormone treatment, are typically reserved for older adolescents (with parental consent) and adults.

Scott is including anything that reduces government revenues to claim he's cut taxes 75 times. But, as we've said before, the list includes things that are clearly not tax cuts. In addition, Scott is claiming those tax cuts have resulted in the creation of 1.3 million jobs. The fact is, state economists predicted Florida would add 1 million jobs in over the same time period before Scott was even elected governor and had an opportunity to enact his policies.

The correct number is actually 70 percent, which is close to what the meme said. But it’s worth noting there's significant doubt about how meaningful this connection is. Several independent experts said it’s not obvious that the defense industry would have a strong self-interest in supporting the continued existence of the program, and if they don’t, that would undercut the meme’s underlying message. Others say defense contractors do have a small but real interest in seeing that police get the equipment.

"Marijuana is a Schedule I drug, ""which you understand means that you can’t do any research about it.""Clinton said marijuana is a Schedule I drug, ""which you understand means that you can’t do any research about it.""
It’s hard to research marijuana, especially using plants (as opposed to synthetic versions) in studies involving human subjects. There are many regulatory hoops scientists have to navigate, and the government has a single-source monopoly on marijuana plants to be used for research. All of this makes setting up a marijuana experiment a lengthy and daunting process.
However, there are scientists currently studying marijuana, and federal funding supports some of these experiments. Clinton’s statement gives the impression that the government bans marijuana research flat-out, and that’s not the case.

That post and many like it are simply wrong.

The legislation would eliminate automatic sex offeder registration for young adults who are convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. Instead, a judge would make that decision, just as existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders in cases involving vaginal intercourse on the registry.
The bill would not, in any fashion, make it legal for any adult to have any type of sex with a minor. The only change involves giving a judge discretion over whether to list an offender on the sex registry for certain sex acts.

"“We watched Terry McAuliffe, when he was governor, lower the (accreditation) standards in our schools...”Youngkin said, ""We watched Terry McAuliffe, when he was governor, lower the standards in our schools so that schools that weren’t being accredited could now be accredited.""
Accreditation standards were eased during McAuliffe’s governorship. The plan was devised by his hand-picked state school board. Eighty-eight schools were denied accreditation the year before the reforms took effect. None have been denied certification since.
McAuliffe ran for governor in 2013 promising to deemphasize the state’s reliance on its  standardized tests in determining public schools’ accreditation. At least 30 local school boards demanded such reforms and the General Assembly overwhelmingly ordered it in 2015. So, the changes were not brought unilaterally by McAuliffe, as Youngkin suggests. There was a strong bipartisan calling.
On the whole, we rate Youngkin’s claim Mostly True.

"""We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.""Clinton said, ""We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.""
She’s parroting a line she has stated previously.
Clinton points to a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively.
This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree, so we rate Clinton’s claim Half True.

"Says “John James supported Betsy DeVos’ agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead.”The Senate Majority PAC claimed in a Facebook ad that James ""supported Betsy DeVos’ agenda to cut public school funding and put it into wealthy private schools instead.""
During her tenure as education secretary, DeVos has sought funding cuts to public schools while increasing federal funding to help more children enroll in private schools.
James has made comments supportive of DeVos’ school choice efforts broadly, but his campaign declined to offer details on his education policy proposals, and he has no legislative voting record to indicate where he stands.
It may seem like James is benefiting from the lack of information he and his campaign have provided on his education platform. Nonetheless, the PAC did not provide conclusive evidence for its claim that he favors directing federal funding away from public schools to supporting private schools.

"""We have a host of issues associated with high B.M.I.s. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""Harrison said the notion that a higher BMI causes poor health outcomes ""just isn’t true"" ― adding that ""we have a host of issues associated with high BMIs. But correlation doesn’t prove causation, and there’s a significant body of research showing that weight stigma and weight cycling can explain most if not all of the associations we see between higher weights and poor health outcomes.""
On a strict reading of the science, she has a point. It is very difficult to prove definitively what causes disease, and showing ""correlation"" is a different finding than causation. However, she appears to apply this standard selectively, using it both to undermine the relationship between high BMI and poor health outcomes, and as evidence of how weight cycling and stigma are linked to certain chronic health conditions.
But in the case of obesity, researchers in multiple studies nationally and worldwide have shown definite links between being overweight and developing diseases, such as diabetes, and conditions, such as painful joints. There is far less evidence for the role that weight stigma and yo-yo dieting has in the development of those medical problems, although the experts urge continuing research into those questions.

His campaign spokesman pointed to a city homeless survey that shows for one selective window of time, 2002 to 2009, San Francisco reduced its homeless street population by 40 percent.

We interpreted his statement as reflecting his full tenure as mayor, not part of it.
Newsom also spoke of just one segment of the homeless population -- those on the streets, but not the overall total including people in shelters. The overall total has gone up, not down.
His claim that ""We got 12,000 people off the street,"" is supported by statements from his former homeless czar. It’s important to note, however, that the city used Homeward Bound, a bus ticket program, to move about 5,000 of those people out of San Francisco.

"California’s proposed tobacco tax ""diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don't have to help even one more patient.""A recent No on 56 campaign ad claims: ""Prop 56 diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don't have to help even one more patient.""
The Legislative Analyst’s Office reported that 82 percent of revenue generated by the measure, after some is directed to other funds, would be spent to ""increase the level of payment for healthcare, services and treatment provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.""
Experts who have examined Prop 56 say there’s a strong chance that higher reimbursement rates will attract more doctors and expand health care access for patients.
There’s the smallest sliver of truth to the No on 56 campaign’s claim that providers ""don’t have to help even one more patient"" because the measure does not dictate how many new patients will be served.
But the claim also asks one to suspend reality by believing no new doctors would be attracted by the higher rates and that current doctors would not add more patients.
Even the addition of handful of new doctors would expand healthcare access, shooting down the campaign’s misleading statement.
We rated its claim Mostly False.
MOSTLY FALSE– The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"""From the release of a child rapist from the Dominican Republican to that of an Italian drug smuggler, Philadelphians have already been put in direct danger by Mayor Kenney’s policy of blocking local law enforcement from participating with federal immigration authorities.""Philly GOP Chair Joe DeFelice said in a statement, ""From the release of a child rapist from the Dominican Republican (sic) to that of an Italian drug smuggler, Philadelphians have already been put in direct danger by Mayor Kenney’s policy of blocking local law enforcement from participating with federal immigration authorities.""
Of the two examples given, one man who DeFelice is referring  was released before Kenney’s time. Plus, whether the release of these men poses a ""direct danger"" raises questions. Recent data analysis shows that sanctuary counties are not more dangerous. Can we extrapolate that Dalloco returned to drug smuggling? According to court records, Dalloco wasn’t charged with any crimes in Philadelphia before ICE rearrested him in August 2016, which was two months after his release.

Ryan is leading the effort to pass the tax bill. But while he supports the college savings plan provision, he hasn’t spoken out publicly to push that provision.
Conception language in the provision is divisive among anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups. And it is ‘disguised’ in the sense that it inserts the concept of unborn children into federal law without making any material change to what are known as 529 college savings plans.
The provision would not, however, ban or even restrict abortion rights -- although advocates fear that inserting unborn children language into federal law could be used to erode abortion rights in the future.

Trump’s $916 million loss could have allowed him to have a $50 million deduction each year for 18 years.
As for Buffet and Soros, Trump is likely referring to a $514 million deduction Buffett’s company, not Buffett himself, took in 2013. (We’ll note that this amount is actually smaller than what Trump would have been permitted to take.) Buffett says he personally took a $5.5 million deduction.
Soros manages a hedge fund. Experts told us any deductions from this hedge fund would not appear on Soros’ personal tax returns.

And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses.""
On both of these attacks, the ad makes a sweeping statement without filling in viewers about the scope of what a bill and a policy actually said.
The Social Security provision was more narrow than the ad suggests, because it addressed the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by people who at one time had been undocumented immigrants.
While attorney general, DeWine concluded that undocumented immigrants who had temporary status through the federal DACA program were entitled to driver’s licenses, but that didn’t apply to all undocumented immigrants.

"""The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions.""McCaskill said, ""The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions.""
The bill would help insurance companies cover individuals who are high-risk, which is a category that many pre-existing conditions fall into.

It’s reasonable to argue that Clinton, as head of the State Department, should shoulder some responsibility for the bureaucratic failures that may have contributed to the tragedy. But there’s no evidence that suggests, as Pence does, that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the deaths of the four Benghazi victims.
As for Clinton’s comment, it did not come ""after four Americans fell,"" but in a subsequent congressional hearing.

Crisafulli is using incendiary language to describe state projections about Medicaid expansion. The state estimates that about 609,000 Floridians would lose access to subsidies to buy insurance under an expansion.

"A recent stomach virus outbreak at the beleaguered Quincy Veterans’ Home shows Gov. Bruce Rauner ""is letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes.""Pritzker’s March 30 tweet held out a recent norovirus outbreak that sickened two dozen individuals at a state-run veterans’ facility in Quincy as evidence of how Rauner had been ""letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes."" Rauner has been under fire for his administration’s handling of deadly outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease at the facility.
Yet unlike Legionnaires’, which is contracted by inhaling water vapor contaminated with the bacteria, the stomach bug state health officials suspect caused the latest Quincy health problems is spread from person to person, rendering a case for structural mismanagement something of a stretch.
Norovirus spreads most frequently in closed environments like nursing homes and assisted living facilities such as Quincy. There is no specific cure for it, meaning the response from care providers is largely limited to isolating patients, casting doubt on what Rauner or his administration could have done to prevent or eliminate it.
Asked how Rauner bears blame for the gastroenteritis outbreak, Pritzker’s campaign did not directly respond, instead attempting to characterize it as further evidence after the Legionnaires’ problems at Quincy that the Republican should not be trusted to handle any health issue at the state facility.
That conflates two very different epidemiological challenges, and leaves an impression--disputed by experts--that more could have, and should have, been done to stop the spread of norovirus at Quincy.
For that, we rate Pritzker’s claim as Mostly False.

There’s no evidence Cereceda met the state’s strict definition of lobbying, and he was not registered as a lobbyist. He did, however, pressure Rubio to extend a PIP insurance mandate the then-speaker of the House opposed. His mother also bought Rubio’s house in the middle of a legislative session that could have dealt with the issue, at more than $200,000 what Rubio paid for it. Both men deny the sale influenced debate in Tallahassee, and no one can prove otherwise.
Rubio didn’t really have a change of heart on any insurance vote. Months after the 2007 session ended, the House and Senate overwhelmingly agreed on new PIP terms that included fraud protections meeting Rubio’s expectations.

"""We began seeing the increase in unaccompanied minors going back to last April 2020.

It’s accurate to say that the number of children traveling alone to the border has been increasing since last April, but her statement downplays the fact that February saw a record increase in unaccompanied minors encountered by Border Patrol agents.
Escobar also said that these increases are not ""a result of Joe Biden becoming president."" Experts say that the pull factor created by Biden’s policy change to stop expulsions of the minors is one of several factors driving the uptick in unaccompanied minors.

"“Why did the state do that with COVID patients in nursing homes? It’s because the state followed President Trump’s CDC guidance.”The CDC's guidance at the time of the March 25 state order was that COVID-19 patients who are medically stable can be discharged from a hospital to a nursing home, but only if the nursing home can implement all recommended infection control procedures.
CMS, a federal agency that regulates nursing homes, issued similar guidance, and also said that preferably, coronoavirus patients should be cared for in a dedicated unit.
Like CDC and CMS, the state Health Department said only those patients who are medically stable can be discharged, and alsorecommendedthat nursing homes consider dedicated units, if possible. The Health Department prohibited nursing homes from requiring a COVID-19 test before admitting a resident, while CMS said new residents should be tested, but did not require it.
The Cuomo administration points to state and federal regulations that predate the pandemic, which require facilities to accept only those patients they can care for. In addition, earlier state communications encouraged nursing homes to stay current with CDC guidance.
But once the state issued its March 25 advisory, nursing home operators said that they felt they had no choice but to accept residents who were either known to be infected or suspected to be. That’s because the March 25 memo did not say anything about making sure that a nursing home can care for a patient before making an admission decision, and said they ""must comply with the expedited receipt of residents.""

HB2 says transgender people in North Carolina must use restrooms in schools and other government facilities that match with the sex listed on their birth certificates instead of the sex with which they identify. It raises the spectacle of government enforcing a law aimed against a tiny minority. It has provoked protests and boycotts from businesses, sports organizations and entertainers that have cost the state dearly.

It’s not necessarily fair to blame construction-related referendums on funding levels — those are heavily determined by building condition and enrollment trends — but narrowing the focus to referendums for ongoing spending still shows more than 900,000 votes in support.

"""Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine we in the US had no access to because we sanctioned Cuba.”A Facebook post said Cuba had a lung cancer vaccine that the United States had no access to due to the decades-long embargo. There is an element of accuracy here, but it lacks several important pieces of information.
A lung cancer vaccine doesn’t prevent the disease; it is judged a success if it slows down or stops tumor growth. The drug in this case, Cimavax, extended life by about three months in the Cuban study. Access to Cimavax is limited to about 180 patients in one American study and those who go on their own to Cuba. The combined total represents a tiny fraction of people with lung cancer.

"Drivers will “get guaranteed earnings, health care benefits, personal protections, and they can maintain their flexible schedules.”The stipend offered under Proposition 22 is a ""health care benefit,"" but the wording is misleading and ignores critical informaiton.
While neither Lyft nor the Yes on 22 campaign says the proposition will give drivers health insurance, saying that it will offer them ""health care benefits"" gives the impression that the stipend is similar to traditional job-based coverage. It’s not.
Drivers who value the ability to make their own schedules would have to figure out how to work an average of nearly 40 hours a week — essentially full time — to receive the full stipend. The stipend would cover a fraction of the premiums for health insurance that’s typically less generous than what they’d get as employees.
Moreover, because drivers’ stipends could change quarterly based on their driving time — which could be affected by vacation or illness — any coverage purchased with the stipend could carry a cloud of uncertainty.

"""It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia.""Sanders said ""It costs a hell of a lot more money to put somebody in jail than send them to the University of Virginia.""
He starts his calculation with a figure of the nearly $31,000 average cost for a federal prisoner. Prisoners held by state corrections systems in the U.S., on average, cost closer to $28,000, based on the latest figures available. In Virginia, that is a little more than $27,000.
Sanders’ campaign compares prison costs only to the cost of tuition at U.Va. That figure represents a significant low-ball for many U.Va. students, who pay the added costs of room and board as well as other fees.
U.Va. estimates of the full cost for attending in the 2013-14 school year ranged from $26,000 to $31,000 for in-state students. That price doesn’t include an additional $8,800 the state provided to pay for Virginia undergraduates’ education. Out-of-state students’ bottom-line cost can range from $54,000 to $60,000.
When all those costs are put together, they exceed the annual prisoner costs Sanders cites.
Still, the truth behind Sanders’ statement rests to some extent on the length of sentence for each prisoner and where they are held. If their incarceration surpasses four years, then it easily could surpass the cost of sending a student to the University of Virginia. Also, if that prisoner is held in a state such as New York, with high state prisoner incarceration costs of roughly $60,000 annually, it also could outpace the cost of sending someone to U.Va.
We rate his claim Half True.

It’s hard to know by what metric Abbott gauges the efficacy of a shutdown. Experts say that if measuring strictly transmission rates and case numbers, shutdowns have proven to be effective in managing spread. But it’s harder to quantify the efficacy of a shutdown when considering all the social and economic consequences.

Putting aside the fact that this could not actually happen, we heard very different opinions from scientists on whether the definition would really exclude Earth if it were in Pluto’s shoes.
Pluto was demoted as a planet because it could not clear its orbital zone, a requirement established by the astronomers union. However, the IAU definition is ambiguous because no planet can ever completely clear its orbital zone. Absent a clearer definition, scientists disagree about whether Earth would be declassified in this far-fetched scenario, though it certainly would not do as good a job at ""clearing the neighborhood"" as it does now.

"""Europe and other nations (need to) contribute to Ukraine. Because they’re not doing it. Just the United States.

In terms of military aid, the statement overlooks that NATO and individual European nations have spent over 10 million euros on equipment and training to help Ukraine’s military. However, the United States has provided the lion’s share of military aid.
Where the statement strays widely from the facts is on the nonmilitary side. There, the countries of Europe, individually and through multilateral European bodies, have done much more for Ukraine than the United States.

"""Big rooftop solar's plan forces Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar.""A pro-NV Energy backed group is running ads claiming that ""Nevada families who don’t have solar panels to pay higher power bills to subsidize rooftop solar.""
The net-metering subsidy question is complex and likely takes more than a 30-second television ad to explain in full. The root of the subsidy claim comes from a Public Utilities Commission decision that has been criticized for focusing too narrowly on the costs of the program. Rooftop solar systems have traditionally seen subsidies on both the state and federal level, but without hard evidence of a cost-shift occurring under the previous net metering rates, it’s a difficult argument to hold up.
The reality is more complicated than Solar Energy Fairness puts on. We rate this claim as Half True.

"“McDonald’s (makes) you all sign noncompete contracts that you cannot go across town to try to get a job at Burger King.”Biden said that McDonald’s workers sign a noncompete agreement that bars them from taking a better paying job with a competing chain.

McDonald’s ended that practice in March 2017, and since then, over 150 national chains have followed suit.

That’s not how hospital executives and other elected officials heard Cuomo describe his initial plan, thus explaining the immediate backlash. And those who listened to the governor’s televised briefing heard him say this: ""So am I willing to deploy the National Guard and inconvenience people for several hundred lives? You’re damn right I am.""
Parsing that quote to find any semblance of ""voluntary"" is beyond challenging.
Cuomo said the state would move hospital equipment from one part of the state to harder-hit areas that desperately needed them because of the Covid-19 outbreak.

"""Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility.

Working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We’re going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage.""
Toomey’s staff said the senator was referring to federal eligibility for that class of adults when he said ""no one loses coverage."" But Toomey did not clearly state nobody would lose eligibility under the Senate plan. He said ""no one loses coverage,"" leaving his comment open for multiple interpretations. As Rosenbaum said, ""Senator Toomey conflates two things.""
So Toomey is correct that eligibility for a certain class of adults who qualify for Medicaid under Obamacare and previously hadn’t continues under the Senate plan. But it’s possible, even likely, individuals enrolled in Medicaid under the Obama expansion would lose coverage if states decline to cover the shortfall they’ll face after the federal government reduces its share of expanded Medicaid costs.

Two Democrats have called for a 50 percent cut and two have said that should be a goal.

"Joe Biden said, “The things I did while in elected office should not be made public while I am seeking a higher public office.”A Facebook post claims Biden went on MSNBC and said, ""The things I did while in elected office should not be made public while I am seeking a higher public office.""
He didn’t literally say it.
During the interview, Biden denied the sexual assault allegation and called for the National Archives to release any complaint it found from Reade. He did say that his sealed senatorial records could be taken out of context if made public, referring broadly to his personal papers held by the University of Delaware, not specifically to a complaint by Reade.

We see how Cruz reached his figures. But ICE says 169 individuals with murder convictions were released and 72 percent of those releases were mandatory—out of its control. Also, 68,000 of the people Cruz described as released were never actually detained by the agency.
In addition, this statement is missing vital context. Just as we said in reviewing Smith’s declaration, it’s simplistic to suggest the administration has full decision-making authority. Court decisions and federal laws play important roles.

"The war on drugs led to ""a 500 percent increase in incarceration in our country, disproportionately affecting poor and disproportionately affecting minorities.""Booker said the 40-year war on drugs led to ""a 500 percent increase in incarceration in our country, disproportionately affecting poor and disproportionately affecting minorities.""
Booker has his numbers right, looking at incarcerated population growth over the past 40 years. It’s hard to conclusively attribute the rapid rise to the war on drugs, but many experts believe that it is a major factor, if not the primary factor.
Minorities are disproportionately represented in the prison population, and some slightly dated research indicates poor people are, as well. Evidence seems to show that black people are more likely to be arrested for drug crime than white people, despite being equally likely to use and less likely to sell drugs.
Even though it’s hard to prove a direct causal effect, the evidence seems to back up Booker’s claim. Because of that additional context, we rate his claim Mostly True.

Trump did not overrule his own EPA, the agency rather did not adhere to recommendations from a science advisory board. The advisory board told the EPA it had concerns with how the agency did a risk assessment and said it should do a new one.
The chair of the advisory board said that in the absence of a new assessment, it was difficult to say definitively whether the rule would have the impact Pelosi said.

Concern that more people are able to vote does not amount to an interest in cheating.

If the EARN IT Act passed — which is not imminent — it would make it easier for law enforcement to demand information from technology companies about certain users of their services. But the bill is receiving public scrutiny and proceeding through Congress in a typical way, so it’s not accurate to describe it as sneaky.
The post is also misleading about the official scope of the act. Far from green-lighting government intrusion into ""all"" messages and calls, any such requests would have to be premised on a link to suspected child exploitation.

The ad is right that she said it was ridiculous to try to ban flag-burning.

Government and independent researchers corroborate the percentage figures Sanders cited, but the researchers who came up with the $500 billion savings admitted that ""any such estimate is imprecise.""
Also, the administrative costs of private insurance and Medicare cover different types of costs. Experts told us that a single-payer system for the United States would have lower administrative costs than today’s private insurance, but it likely wouldn’t be able to achieve administrative costs as low as the existing Medicare program.

"“Because our family couldn’t afford health insurance, Obama/Biden penalized us about $10,000, then took that $10,000 and used it to pay for others’ free Obamacare. Trump ended that theft.”A viral social media post claims that a family was penalized $10,000 for not being able to afford health insurance. It also claimed the penalty money was taken to pay for others’ ""free ObamaCare"" and Trump stopped that practice.
It is true that Trump and Congress did zero out the individual mandate requirement, so people could no longer be penalized for not having health insurance. But after that, skepticism abounds.
For instance, it’s very unlikely that a family would face a $10,000 penalty in one year. Moreover, if such a family did face this penalty for not having health insurance, they would likely be in a high-income bracket for which health insurance tends to come from an employer or be affordable. And the charge that the penalty was used to provide ""free coverage"" for others doesn’t fit with federal accounting processes.

""And that’s why they closed this case.""Rep. Bera’s statement that federal investigators said he and his campaign ""had no idea what was going on"" mostly matches with Talbert’s May comments.
Still, it’s not entirely clear why the case was closed.
We don’t know for sure without an explanation from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which declined to elaborate on the subject.
What we do know is Bera was investigated and no charges were brought against him. Bera’s statement is not far from the mark.
It would have been completely correct, however, if Bera had repeated what the U.S. attorney said that there was ""no indication"" he or his campaign had any connection to the crime. His statement could have benefited from this key clarification.
We rate it Mostly True.
MOSTLY TRUE– The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"""Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay admission or be on an approved list.""Ross said: ""Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay an admission or be on an approved list.""
It’s pretty clear that access to Walker is limited. His schedule is generally not made public ahead of time, making it difficult for people to go to events he attends. There are events that are open to the public, such as holiday ceremonies, that Walker attends. But in terms of events Walker himself holds, his campaign team cited campaign events at which registration is requested but not required, a 9/11 ceremony that the governor's office co-sponsored and a news event that had not been announced to the general public.
For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

"""When Rick Baker heard (racist remarks from another mayoral candidate), he went after Congemi. Rick Kriseman he just looked away. Tolerating bigotry in silence is no virtue; taking it on is.""A television ad paid for by Rick Baker’s PAC said he condemned racist comments from another candidate while Kriseman ""just looked away.""
Baker did speak up during the mayoral forum. In doing so, he acknowledged that he was going against the organizers’ rules by not sticking to the question at hand and revisiting earlier comments.
Kriseman did not comment on what Congemi said that night. Neither did four other candidates at the forum. Kriseman waited until the next day, and was criticized for it. He said he did not want to bring more attention to the message in the moment but regretted not doing so.
The admaker misleads viewers by neglecting to include Kriseman's later condemnation of what Congemi said.
This ad is partially accurate but omits substantial information about what happened. We rate it Half True.

"""If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.""Sanders said that ""if you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. ... African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent.""
As was the case when we first reviewed this claim last July, Sanders’ general point is correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do.
But while Sanders had support for this data when he first began using these numbers eight months ago, there’s reason to believe that the improving job market has lowered these rates, at least somewhat. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

"“Now (Biden) is saying that people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.”Scalise said it is Biden’s policy that ""people who came here illegally can jump ahead of other Americans who have been waiting to get the vaccine.""
The Biden administration has made it clear that unauthorized immigrants are eligible to receive the vaccine if they are part of a priority group, such as health care workers or seniors. That does mean some unauthorized immigrants who meet specific vaccination criteria for job duties or age could receive a shot before American citizens who do not meet those requirements. This is in keeping with long-standing public health practices.
But Scalise was misrepresenting Biden’s policy when he suggested that unauthorized immigrants are being prioritized over American citizens or can jump the vaccination line. Eligibility for the vaccine is based on job and age categories — period. Under the Biden approach, immigration status is not a qualifying or disqualifying factor.
His statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"According to a recent CDC report, ""almost everyone — 85% — who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly (wearing a mask) doesn’t work the way they tell us it works.”Carlson said that according to a recent CDC report, ""Almost everyone — 85% — who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly this doesn't work the way they tell us it works.""
Carlson didn’t pull the 85% figure out of thin air, but the conclusion he drew is wrong in multiple ways. For starters, the CDC report wasn’t designed to measure mask effectiveness, and the study’s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S.
The findings don’t prove masks are ineffective, either. Masks are most effective at preventing infected people from spreading the virus, and studies show they can help slow the spread.
The correlation the CDC found between positive coronavirus tests and going to restaurants and bars suggests that taking masks off to eat or drink might increase risk.
We rate Carlson’s statement False.

"""In the Obama-Biden administration, we got China to cut cyber-theft -- it's gotten significantly worse under this administration.""Biden said: ""In the Obama-Biden administration, we got China to cut cyber-theft — it's gotten significantly worse under this administration.""
China did reduce its cyber-theft from American companies in the wake of a groundbreaking deal it made in 2015 with the Obama administration, but other factors may also have led to the reduction.
The consensus among experts is that China’s cyber-thefts have gone on the uptick since Trump took office, but other factors, such as a dip in China’s economy, may have also played a role.
We rate Biden’s statement Mostly True.

"“We will be over 290 electoral votes on Election Night ... no matter what they (Democrats) try to do, what kind of hijinks or lawsuits or whatever kind of nonsense they try to pull off.”Miller said, ""We will be over 290 electoral votes on Election Night ... no matter what they try to do, what kind of hijinks or lawsuits or whatever kind of nonsense they try to pull off.""
No candidate will ""be over 290 electoral votes"" on Election Night, because electoral votes aren’t cast until Dec. 14 and won’t be counted until Jan. 6. Beyond that, Miller is miscasting how media organizations will call races for one candidate or the other on Election Night.
Media outlets won’t be calling any battleground states until there’s adequate information to do so with confidence. If a state hasn’t yet counted enough votes from mail ballots to have a sense of how mail voters are breaking between the candidates, media organizations won’t call the states for either candidate; they’ll call it ""too early to call"" or ""too close to call."" It would be inaccurate to count a media organization’s ""too close to call"" state as part of either the Trump column or the Biden column, even if partial returns show that candidate ahead.

"The Hyde Amendment ""language was in the (human trafficking) bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it.""Rove said the Hyde Amendment ""language was in the bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it.""
The abortion language was indeed in the human trafficking bill considered this year, though it was not in a similar bill considered last year.
A Democratic staffer was aware it was in the bill, but that message wasn’t conveyed up the food chain. The only flaw in Rove’s statement is the suggestion that the Democratic sponsor, Klobuchar knew about the language and voted for it anyway.

"""The high cost of child care is the No. 1 reason people give for having fewer children than they’d like.""Warren said, ""The high cost of child care is the number one reason people give for having fewer children than they’d like."" That is what respondents said in a survey commissioned by the New York Times.
The experts in fertility that we reached said the cost of raising children is certainly a factor, but that particular survey doesn’t prove that the cost of child care ranks above all others. Experts said research is limited, but what's been done suggests that a host of forces, including economic conditions, government policy, religion, ethnicity and education all play important roles.

"""Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.""O’Malley ""Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.""
In 2000, in the wake of the Columbine school shooting, Clinton was emphatic about her support for gun control. In 2008, she dropped her support for a gun license and registration proposal and positioned herself to the right of her major opponent, Obama. While Clinton also advocated for leaving some gun control to the states, she still advocated for federal gun control efforts, and she never said ""we don’t need federal standards.""
In 2015, Clinton has been more forceful with her support for gun control than she was in 2008 -- closer to her rhetoric in 2000.
O’Malley has a point that Clinton’s positioning on gun control has shifted between election cycles, but it wasn’t nearly as dramatic as he made it out to be. We rate his claim Half True.

"""California won’t let law enforcement officers like you and your people transfer prisoners to ICE custody or even to communicate with ICE that you’re about to release them from your custody — people that ICE is looking for.""U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed California prevents local law enforcement from communicating with and transferring prisoners to federal immigration agents.
There are limits on cooperation under California’s SB 54. Local law enforcement are prohibited from working with immigration agents in cases where undocumented immigrants are charged with minor crimes, unless they are presented with a federal warrant.  Notably, the law does not limit cooperation in cases involving 800 serious misdemeanor and felony crimes.

"""(James) Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary (Clinton).""PatriotCrier.com said, ""Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source and covered it up for Hillary.""
The website’s assertion that Comey knew Rich was WikiLeaks’ source of the DNC emails and hid the evidence to protect Clinton is a wild assumption based on refuted evidence. A private investigator had claimed that the FBI had analyzed Rich’s laptop and found proof that he had given the emails to WikiLeaks, but then recanted his story. Fox News and its network affiliate, which had broadcast the story, later retracted it.
There’s no evidence there’s any link between Rich and WikiLeaks. The FBI has indirectly denied investigating the case, which Washington police consider a robbery gone wrong.

You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass.""
Skolnik said he was referring to the Fugitive Slave Acts, which could result in prison time for runaway slaves until they were returned to their owner. But those acts had nothing to do with passing as white, as slaves were considered property.
Post-Civil War Jim Crow laws did not include passing as white as a crime that could send someone to jail. However, blacks exposed as passing as white would be treated like other blacks under the law. And that, depending on the crime, could result in imprisonment.

There’s no evidence that Kabul fell to the Taliban as part of an intentional scheme to change the U.S. population in a way that favors Democrats. And even in the highly unlikely scenario that all potential Afghan refugees were to become U.S. voters, there is no evidence about how they would vote or that their votes alone would serve to ""change the body politic permanently.""

"“For the World Health Organization, the international entity whose sole responsibility it is to alert the world of global pandemics like this, to miss this, is a huge problem.”During a conservative talk radio interview, Fitzpatrick accused the WHO of missing the pandemic, citing a Jan. 14 tweet in which the organization reported Chinese assurances that  there was no human-to-human transmission of the virus.
Experts argue that the WHO was slow to acknowledge human-to-human transmission, declare the coronavirus a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" and label it a pandemic.
But the agency was actively gathering and disseminating information about the virus in the weeks prior to the official pandemic declaration, and it’s possible to interpret public statements made during this time as cautious, not reckless. Saying the WHO missed the pandemic altogether goes too far. Also, Fitzpatrick’s claim doesn’t acknowledge the WHO’s work promoting public health.

"""If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business … you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use’ and once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks.""Duckworth said former firearms dealers can transfer guns from their inventory into their personal collections, and then sell those guns without background checks.
Federal law permits gun dealers to transfer inventory to their personal collections, and private gun sales under federal law do not require background checks. Many states, including Illinois, have added their own requirements, though.
A former dealer—and any other private individual—could still get into trouble by continuing to buy and sell with profit as their main motive rather than enhancing or liquidating their collection. But there’s no definitive legal yardstick—such as the number of guns sold—for determining compliance.

And Tammy Duckworth voted ‘yes.’ ""
Duckworth did vote in favor of the JCPOA, but the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC’s ad is still incorrect on several fronts. The advertisement indicates there are multiple documents. But according to the Associated Press story the ad references, there is only one secret document. The ad also says these ""secret documents"" would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon sooner than we were told. This, too, is incorrect. The document explains the secret agreement would boost uranium enrichment capacity, but never says Iran would be able to obtain a weapon sooner.
Finally, an expert told PolitiFact Illinois that there is actually no contradiction between the main agreement and the secret document, just a bit more detail.

It would cost us more money to bring the troops home than to keep them in Europe.""Burns said European allies ""pay us $2.5 billion a year to keep our forces there. It would cost us more money to bring the troops home than to keep them in Europe.""
The $2.5 billion figure is the most recent estimate -- but the data is 16 years old. It mostly encompasses hard-to-calculate ""indirect costs,"" and it only covers about one-third of U.S. military expenditures in Europe.
Meanwhile, experts said it’s conceivable that it would be more expensive to close up shop in Europe and bring troops back to the United States, but there are many variables surrounding that decision and it’s difficult to factor in the intangible strategic losses from giving up a European footprint.

"Says Minnesota congressional candidate Jim Hagedorn supports a plan that would take away health care for 340,000 veterans, with 17,000 in Minnesota possibly losing coverage.VoteVets said Hagedorn supports a plan that would take away ""health care for 340,000 veterans. In Minnesota alone, 17,000 veterans could lose their health coverage.""
Hagedorn says that’s not true, in part because of his proposal for broader VA enrollment. It’s an interesting idea, but not on the verge of congressional consideration. Yet the Medicaid cuts have been on the verge of consideration -- and even got House approval -- for some time.
PolitiFact examined a number of claims around last year’s discussions. When White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said the House plan ""doesn’t get rid of Medicaid expansion,"" PolitiFact called itMostly False,explaining that with reduced federal funding, states would likely find continuing it unsustainable. When Rep. Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said ""nobody on Medicaid"" would have benefits taken away, we ruled itFalsefor similar reasons. And when the Senate considered the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, PolitiFact said a claim by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida -- that ""there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid"" -- wasMostly False. There were other claims, and you can read themhere.
VoteVets used two specific numbers in its claim. The first number, 340,000, is a nationwide figure for veterans in the Medicaid expansion pool. There is no way to know if every one of them would lose coverage. As for the 17,000 figure in the ad, it includes all veterans on Medicaid in Minnesota, not just those in the expansion pool.
The claim is based on analyses, and things might turn out differently, especially if states stepped up, as Hagedorn expects.
As such, we rate this claim Half True.
sub-questions:","1. Does Hagedorn supports a plan that would take away ""health care for 340,000 veterans?
2. Does Hagedorn support a plan where, In Minnesota alone, 17,000 veterans could lose their health coverage?

"The status quo led the General Assembly to reduce pension payments four straight years starting in 2005, costing billions of dollars as the delay in contributions essentially borrowed from pension funds at a very high interest rate.In an opinion piece published by a Springfield newspaper, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner said lawmakers in the Illinois General Assembly authorized reduced pension payments from 2005-2009. He said those lowered contributions cost billions and were akin to borrowing from the funds at a high interest rate.
The General Assembly’s own finance agency and a federal settlement with the SEC confirms four years of reduced contributions. The SEC said the move aggravated the funds’ condition and ability to meet its obligations and worsened its creditworthiness. A 2006 report said the underfunding required $6.8 billion more in payments.

"“The reality is when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way.”Pence claimed the Biden plan to address COVID-19 was similar to the Trump administration’s plan ""every step of the way.""
A cursory, side-by-side look at the Trump administration’s COVID-19 actions — no actual comprehensive plan has been released — and the Biden plan indicates some big picture overlap on securing a vaccine and ramping up testing. But that’s where the similarities end.
Biden’s plan includes proposed actions the Trump administration has not pursued. It also is focused on federal rather than state authority, a significant distinction Pence himself pointed out during the debate.
Additionally, the candidates’ behaviors toward COVID-19 and views on science have been diametrically opposed, with Trump eschewing the use of face masks and social distancing, and Biden closely adhering to both.
Pence’s statement ignores critical facts and realities, making it inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

That is not exactly what Renner said, and it misleads voters about the issue.
Renner supports legislation to eliminate funding for Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida, which Scott says will cost Florida jobs -- ergo, Renner supports losing jobs. Renner, naturally, sees it differently. He thinks the money would be better devoted to tax cuts.

"Says he ""turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,"" but because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history ""everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid.""Walker said he ""turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,"" but because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history ""everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid.""
Under changes made by Walker, everyone in Wisconsin with an annual income at the federal poverty level ($11,770 for a single person) is now eligible for Medicaid. That is the first time in Wisconsin that everyone at or below the federal poverty level is eligible for Medicaid.
But it's important to note that, while Walker rejected the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid, he used another provision of Obamacare to move less poor people off of Medicaid and into the marketplace created by Obamacare. And Wisconsin has already passed up more than$550 millionin federal money, putting an additional burden on state taxpayers.

Trump is correct that the law was pushed by Johnson and that religious groups that advocate for candidates risk losing their tax exempt status.

The ad leaves out a lot of context when it blames Cordray. First, it omits that Cordray inherited a statewide problem. Cordray started to take steps to address the problem, but didn’t get far before he was ousted by DeWine in November 2010.
The ad is on firmer ground when it gives credit to DeWine for his efforts to clear out the backlog. But it omits that it took him several years to do it. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this statement Half True.

"""If we kept (the minimum wage) indexed to inflation, people would be making $20 an hour right now.”Biden said that ""if we kept (the minimum wage) indexed to inflation, people would be making $20 an hour right now.""
Indexing the minimum wage to inflation would have produced a wage today between $8.98 and $12.27, depending on which year you started the indexing. That’s well short of the $20 Biden said.
The White House said Biden should have said that if the minimum wage had been indexed to worker productivity, it would be at $20 an hour today. That’s close to the $24 estimated by a liberal economist, but that’s not what Biden said.

"""For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes (on gambling), somebody loses $6.""Van Zant said, ""For every time the state gets paid a dollar in taxes, somebody loses $6.""
His argument is that the taxes states receive from gaming revenue is money other people have lost while gambling. Van Zant was using nationwide figures from 2005 for the amount of tax money state and local governments received from casinos. That ratio changed to about 7 to 1 by 2014.
But that comparison is tough to apply to Florida. The state has more forms of gambling than just casinos, and the state gets money from all of them in different ways and at different rates. If we look at just the terms of how the Seminole Tribe shares its casino revenue, the state gets about $1 for every $8 people spend in casinos.
Van Zant’s larger point stands that state tax revenue comes at the expense of comparatively high gambling losses, but the details are fuzzy at best. We rate his statement Half True.

"The Iran deal ""violates promises the president made to the American people."" ... ""It is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process.""Rubio said that the Iran nuclear deal ""violates promises the president made to the American people"" because it ""is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process.""
Rubio has a point that a senior administration national-security official did, in at least one case and possibly two cases, say on television that the deal would include ""anytime, anywhere"" inspection provisions. However, focusing on these two comments is a bit of cherry-picking, since most of the White House’s statements on this issue have avoided that term in favor of ones that can be more plausibly used to describe the provisions of the agreement that were ultimately reached.
The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

"""If folks are vaping a legal medical cannabis product that comes from any of the New York state operators, they will not have to worry about the negative impacts on their lungs.""Peoples-Stokes said that people who used medical marijuana obtained from approved operators in New York shouldn’t worry about the negative impact on their lungs.
While state and federal public health officials have not found a link between medical marijuana from regulated operators and lung injury cases, they recommend caution when it comes to vaping. The Centers for Disease Control recommends people do not use e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC and consider refraining from using all e-cigarette and vaping products. The state is telling people to stop using vape products until the cause of the lung illnesses are known, and is urging medical marijuana patients to consider alternatives to vaping while its investigation is underway.

To suggest that lawmakers passed a law that plainly violated the state constitution is wrong. The point Hawley raised is debatable, not clear cut.

I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together.

""When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72.""
A 2006 study by the nonpartisan Education Week placed the district’s graduation rate at 44 percent, while a Harvard study the year before placed the rate at 45.3 percent. They both used enrollment data from the early 2000s.
School district officials in 2006 disputed the findings, saying improvements had been made and the rate was closer to 64 percent.
District data shows that rate had climbed to 70.2 percent immediately after Villaraigosa’s term ended. It rose to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent in the following two years.
Several observers of Los Angeles politics and education said Villaraigosa doesn’t get all the credit but did play an outsized role. He helped elect a reform-minded school board, install a superintendent and created a nonprofit that took control of and helped improve the district’s worst performing schools.
The dispute over the district’s view of its graduation rate is missing from Villaraigosa’s statement. As is the fact that the studies used data from the early 2000s, a few years before Villaraigosa took office.
But there’s certainly evidence to back up the former mayor’s claim about graduation rate improvements and his influence.

"""States like New York, Illinois and California have been vocal in their demands for funding to bail out their pension systems, which were failing long before the COVID-19 outbreak, and other programs that aren’t related to this crisis.""Biggs said that New York was one of several states demanding federal funds to bail out pension funds. He also claimed that New York and other states want federal funds to pay for programs not related to the pandemic.
New York’s pension fund was one of the strongest in the country, according to a nonpartisan, nationwide analysis published in 2019, before the crisis hit state budgets. The New York state comptroller said that the pension system has not requested federal funds.
The other part of Biggs’ statement – that the funding will pay for programs not related to the pandemic – is correct but misleading.

"Says Rep. Mike Coffman is ""the one who said"" he would support Trump.The DCCC said of Coffman, ""You’re the one who said you’d support (Trump),"" in response to Coffman’s ad saying he would stand up to Trump.
The DCCC’s evidence is based on a six-month-old statement during the primary by his campaign spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said Coffman would ""support the Republican nominee,"" stressing Coffman wanted Rubio out of the remaining 11 candidates.
Since then, Coffman has become the only Republican House lawmaker to issue an ad criticizing his party’s presidential nominee. He has condemned Trump’s treatment of a Gold Star family and demanded that he retract his ""totally unAmerican slur"" of a Mexican-American judge.
Most importantly, Coffman himself has repeatedly said the billionaire has a long way to go to earn his support.

"""My grandparents were proud immigrants to the United States of America, here to Illinois in the late 1800s. My grandparents did not speak English when they were young.""Bruce Rauner said his grandparents were immigrants from Sweden who came to the U.S. ""in the late 1800s.""
We have no reason to doubt that Rauner’s grandparents meant the world to him. But the Census plainly refutes his claim that they were immigrants. What’s more, both couldn’t have come to the U.S. in the late 1800s because they weren’t even born until the early 1900s — in Wisconsin, not Sweden. Rauner’s assertion in August that his grandparents immigrated to Illinois is yet another inaccuracy.
Since we don’t have a time machine, we can’t say for certain what language was spoken in the Erickson and Wedin childhood homes. But to the extent that Rauner implies the Ericksons' facility with English was limited, Census reports refute that notion as well.
Topping all that is the acknowledgement by Rauner himself in his 2014 Tribune interview that his grandparents were not immigrants. Still, he continued to repeat the claim on many occasions.
Census records and Rauner’s own admission show that this statement has no credibility. That is why it earns our lowest possible rating, Pants On Fire.

Trump has not always been consistent about his deportation plans. But in Phoenix, he did not literally say of the entire undocumented immigrant population, ""they will all be gone."" He used that kind of language to describe his plans for immigrants who had committed crimes, saying they would be the first to go.
However, Trump did say in the same speech that people here illegally today and who want to be legalized ""have one route and one route only, to return home and apply for reentry like everybody else.""

"Says 1,000 people failed gun background checks in Wisconsin in 2018, but ""almost none of them were prosecuted for trying to do a background check and illegally buy a weapon.""Vos said ""almost none"" of the 1,000 or so people failing a background check each in year in Wisconsin are prosecuted. It’s a lot more complicated claim than it might seem.
Indeed, on average only about two people per year are charged specifically with the crime of providing false information on a background check.
Prosecutors say violators can also be charged with the more serious crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm — or attempting to do so. But anecdotally we found no evidence that this happens frequently.
And, of course, failing a background check is only a crime if the applicant knew they were banned from having a gun.

In Oliver’s context of a naked picture, the comment may be surprising. But to experts familiar with the laws governing surveillance practices and the NSA programs brought to light through his leaks, Snowden is correct that this could happen.
But this isn’t the most likely scenario for most Americans emailing other Americans day-in, day-out. Moreover, the NSA is supposed to ""minimize"" domestic emails that get caught up in a broader sweep, either by deleting them or not searching or using the information.

"“There was no effort” to get American experts into China after it announced the coronavirus, and “we had one person in-country (and Trump) pulled him out of the country.”Biden said that Trump made ""no effort"" to get American experts into China and pulled the ""one person"" the U.S. had on the ground out of China.
Trump’s personal role is unclear, but his Health and Human Services secretary did make the effort to get U.S. experts inside. The department reached out to China in the first week of January, and secretary Azar asked his Chinese counterpart again in late January. China resisted outsiders, both from the U.S. and WHO.
Biden’s assertion that Trump pulled the ""one person"" out of China has more substance, but is not as straight-forward as he made it sound. An American CDC epidemiologist left in July and was not replaced. The overall American staff went from eight down to three. According to the Health and Human Services Department, the staff reduction was mainly driven by changes in the U.S. strategy to reduce HIV/AIDS. Biden made it sound as though everyone left, but some CDC staff remained.

We could not independently determine the extent of Trump’s involvement, although Sanders said the president was not afforded the opportunity to approve of the settlement decision. But the State Department under Trump did initiate the settlement after previously taking steps to clear a path for it.

He was making the point that staying indoors for another month or two with extended shelter-in-place orders won’t get rid of the virus. (Though, as noted, the shelter-in-place orders are not meant to fully eradicate the virus.)
Experts say it’s still too early to know this with complete certainty, since much remains unknown about the nature of immunity. And we have no clue how effective a future vaccine may be.
But a best guess at this point is that COVID-19 could indeed stick around long-term, waxing and waning similar to the seasonal flu. Experts say there’s also reason to believe that lingering version could be less severe, though, a nuance Murdock did not address.

The White House pointed to a 2006 survey that found 66% of voting-eligible women have a document with their current legal name. But the survey didn’t ask women if they were prevented from voting as a result of lacking an ID with their current name.
The Williams Institute at UCLA found that about 42% of transgender adults eligible to vote in 2020 in states that don't vote entirely by mail had no ID documents that reflect their correct name or gender. But the report did not contain a count of trans adults who were not able to cast a ballot due to voter ID.
Women are significantly more likely to change their name than men, so they are more likely to end up with name variations between their voter registration and their IDs. And women are more likely than men to go through a process to update their documents with their new name, but the process can vary by state.

He claimed that she was open to allowing enrichment in 2010, and then in 2014, denied that she was ever open to the idea.
A full reading shows that in 2014, Clinton was talking about whether Iran enjoyed a legal right to enrichment, and she said it did not. An arms control expert we reached agreed that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that Iran signed does not grant that right.
In addition, in that 2014 interview, Clinton did not reject the idea that through negotiations, Iran might be allowed to enrich uranium. The conditions she described in 2014 are similar to the ones in a 2010 interview with the BBC and even more like her House testimony just a few months later in 2011.

Trump is wrong on both counts. Federal law requires states to establish programs to keep voter rolls up to date. To comply with the law, Georgia and other states routinely handle such removals in non-federal election years. In 2019, the state removed about 290,000 voters.

Mitchell is correct that the Global Magnitsky Act contains a provision that allows certain members of congress to ask the president to carry out investigations of suspected human rights violations.
Experts agreed the letter sent to the White House by 22 senators was a clear signal of congressional intent to oblige Trump to look into the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi’s disappearance.

There is some basis for the first part of Baldwin’s statement. One estimate puts the number of at 2.4 million — but those that could be denied health insurance coverage because of a condition is estimated to be much smaller, 852,000.
On the second part of Baldwin’s statement, Vukmir has indicated that high-risk pools are a solution for covering people with pre-existing conditions. But those were in place because -- before the Affordable Care Act, which Vukmir wants to repeal -- insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. And Wisconsin’s high-risk pool covered only a fraction of people with pre-existing conditions.
That being said, Vukmir has not specifically said she supports allowing insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and she has said those should be covered  — even if she has been vague about how that would happen.

"It's entirely possible that the Democratic nominee, [Hillary Clinton], earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s… In fact, it’s quite likely.Pat Toomey said that it was possible and even likely that Hillary Clinton earned more money giving a single speech to a Wall Street bank than he did in his six years there.
Clinton earned $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street bank, so Toomey would have had to have earned an average of about $43,000 per year on Wall Street.
It’s possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So it’s likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold.
It gets less likely if we adjust Toomey’s non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars.

Reid’s claim accurately calls on facts established in a well-respected study of corporate pollution. Koch Industries does produce more greenhouse gas emissions than the oil companies listed by Reid.

"""When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher's license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom.""The Greater Wisconsin Committee says: ""When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher's license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom.""
On the first part of the claim, the state law in place at the time didn’t actually stop Evers from trying to revoke the license who viewed pornography at school. Evers could have initiated revocation proceedings, which the teacher could have challenged.
But Evers concluded that the law didn’t allow for a revocation because the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger children. The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator. And two courts upheld the arbitrator’s decision. Moreover, the fact that Evers’ department backed, and Walker signed, a change in the law supports the idea that the law didn’t favor revocation at the time.
On the second part of the claim, Evers did work with lawmakers to change the law, as the narrator states in the ad, but he didn’t change the law as words on the screen in the ad claim.

He did not hold the aid bill hostage, even while making cost-cutting a personal priority. (The tweet we’re citing also was a bit off about which particular Bible verse he used.)

"""The state that has the highest per capita number of … guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""Clinton said ""the state that has the highest per capita number of ... guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from Vermont.""
Clinton’s specific statistical computation is accurate. But beyond the numbers, Clinton’s claim is misleading for a varied number of reasons. From a policy perspective, experts say raw numbers of gun flows are likely a better measure. And while the ATF data set is the best we have, Clinton’s bold comment glosses over some important caveats about the data, including whether the guns it captures are representative and whether they line up with ""trafficking."" These caveats call into question whether Vermont’s gun policies are having the effect Clinton suggests.
The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context, so we rate it Half True.

"Says Tony Evers ""allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students.""The state Republican Party says Evers ""allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students.""
The teacher was not found guilty of, or even charged with, any crime. Rather, he was fired for viewing pornographic material on his school computer. He got his job back, however, after an arbitrator ruled that the firing was not justified, in part because the arbitrator concluded that the behavior did not endanger any students.
Evers, as the state schools superintendent, had the discretion to initiate license revocation proceedings. But state law at the time required the endangerment of kids in order to revoke a teacher’s license and, like the arbitrator, Evers concluded that the teacher’s conduct didn’t endanger kids.

Other poll workers in Burlington wore the same gear as Vos, so he didn’t receive any special treatment there like the claim implies. Poll workers in other parts of the state had some – but not necessarily all – of the same equipment used by Vos.

"""Every time they’ve done those border patrols, they’ve taken out people who have trafficked drugs. That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job.""Gov. Chris Sununu said federal border checkpoints in New Hampshire help ""take out"" drug traffickers and were a key tool in the opioid crisis. ""That’s the federal government’s role. They’re doing their job,"" he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that drug interdictions and arrests cannot be the intended role of Customs and Border Patrol agents, but rather ancillary actions taken if the situation arises. So, border patrol agents may seize drugs during checkpoints, but they turn over drug cases to local police.
Meanwhile, state courts have ruled that New Hampshire’s constitution prevents drugs found at vehicle checkpoints by drug sniffing dogs from being used as evidence in court. In fact, local-federal cooperation on drug cases has stopped, and no drug-related arrests have been made since the decision.
While drug detection is not the primary purpose of the checkpoints, it is a secondary aim, according to the Border Patrol.
Sununu’s defense of the checkpoints leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.

The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Gimenez did get a 67% pay raise in the fall of 2018, which will increase his pension. But the evidence shows he slashed the mayor’s salary when he took office in 2011.

For information to be considered properly marked classified, it must contain a header. Clinton is correct that nothing in her email had a header signifying its classification status. Three email chains had a ""(C)"" indicating ""confidential"" information, but that is not enough to consider the emails properly marked classified.
But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t any classified information in her email. If someone has determined information to be classified, it is still technically classified even if someone neglects to label it down the line.
